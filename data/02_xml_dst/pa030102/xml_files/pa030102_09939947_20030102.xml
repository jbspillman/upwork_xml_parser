<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a financial transaction system and method, and more particularly, to a network-based system and method for billing and payment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, there has been an increase in the popularity of performing financial transactions using the Internet as a centralized network for linking the individual financial systems of a plurality of entities transacting business with one another. With the recent explosion in e-commerce, the increasing acceptance of the Internet as a less expensive and more efficient way of doing business, and the advent of new server technology and sophisticated online security systems, Internet-based financial transactions are becoming ever more common. Advantageously, an Internet-based financial transaction system for bill presentment and payment may reduce many of the transaction costs associated with other financial transaction systems, such as preparation costs, banking fees, and costs for clearing, reconciling and closing. Moreover, such a transaction system may seamlessly handle transactions from virtually any entity with Internet access, regardless of the nature of the business, geographic location, size, or trading currency, even those entities for which the costs of traditional invoicing, presentment and payment have traditionally been high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, invoice presentment and bill payment procedures have required a capital outlay for the equipment to prepare and distribute each invoice, as well as collect and reconcile payment of the invoice. Additionally, there are costs and collection delays associated with the multiple steps required between multiple parties to effect invoice presentment and bill payment. Such steps may include the payee&apos;s preparation and distribution of invoices by mail (which may take up to a week to reach payers) or electronically; one or more invoice approvals by individuals or departments within the payer&apos;s organization (e.g. a purchasing manager); invoice adjustment or dispute by other individuals or departments; payment authorizations by other individuals or departments; payment issuance, either electronically or by issuance of a paper instrument, such as a check, (again, typically by mail); receipt of payment at the payee&apos;s side, either by the payee, the payee&apos;s bank, a lockbox, or other payment receipt entity; and processing of the payment either at the payee&apos;s bank, at the payee&apos;s accounts receivable, or both. This entire process may take several weeks, and requires separate accounting records to be kept and harmonized at both the payer&apos;s (accounts payable) and payee&apos;s (accounts receivable) sides, and/or within other decentralized record keeping systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are further costs and collection delays associated with any adjustments to the invoice that may be made by either the payer or the payee. When an adjustment is made within one record keeping system, the adjustment must be communicated to the other system(s) so that a corresponding adjustment can be made. For example, an invoice adjustment made by the payer results in the payer&apos;s entry of an adjusted invoice amount into its accounts payable, as well as the payer&apos;s mailing a copy of a manually-adjusted invoice to the payee, so that the payee can update its accounts receivable. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention is to provide an electronic bill presentment and payment system. The system comprises a billing database for storing billing data related to a plurality of bills. Each bill represents an amount payable to a billing client from a paying client. An application server receives a plurality of instruction files, each representing a transaction for reading and manipulating billing data, performs the transaction utilizing data included in the instruction file, and provides a data response file complying with a predetermined format. A presentation server is coupled to the application server and includes a document database comprising a plurality of document style sheets. Each style sheet represents a format for the response data in a predetermined document format corresponding to one of the clients. The presentation server receives the response file and generates a client document utilizing data extracted from the response file and the document style sheet corresponding to the client. More specifically, the style sheet utilized by the presentation server may be a style sheet associated with the billing client associated with the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The document style sheet may include a plurality of document fields and the presentation server may populate each document field by matching data from the data response file to populate the document field. More specifically, the data response file may comprise a plurality of data fields and a plurality of predetermined tags, each tag identifying one of the plurality of data fields and the presentation server may utilize a tag to identify data for inclusion in the client document. Further, one of the predetermined tags may identify a data field which identifies the billing client associated with the transaction and the presentation server may utilizes the data field which identifies the billing client to select a document format for presenting the response data to the client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The data response file comprises an XML message and the client document may be an HTML document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, the presentation server may further receive transaction request files from each of the biller clients and payor clients and generate the instruction file in response thereto. The transaction request files from each of the biller clients and the payor clients may be HTTP posts and the instruction file may be an XML message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of providing electronic bill presentment and payment services to a plurality of billing clients and a plurality of paying clients. The method comprises receiving an invoice file from each of the plurality of billing clients and populating a billing database with data from each invoice file. The invoice file representing amounts payable to the billing client from at least one paying client. The method further comprises receiving an instruction file from a client representing a transaction for reading or manipulating data in the billing database, performing the transaction utilizing data included in the instruction file, generating response data, and providing a client response document comprising the response data in a specified document format corresponding to the client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The specified document format may be defined by a style sheet which includes a plurality of document fields and the step of providing the client response document may comprise populating each document field by matching data from the response data to a document field. More specifically, the response data may comprise a plurality of data fields and a plurality of predetermined tags, each tag identifying one of the plurality of data fields and the step of populating each document field comprises matching the field to a tag identify data for inclusion within the document field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Further, one of the predetermined tags may identify a data field which identifies the billing client associated with the transaction and the step of providing a client response document may comprise identifying the billing client and selecting a document format associated with the billing client for providing the client response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The response data may be formatted an XML message and the client response document is an HTML document.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an electronic bill presentment and payment system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consistent with the present invention. System <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes at least one biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, at least one payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, at least one business service provider system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a payment processing system (&ldquo;ASP&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, in communication with one another via a network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be a TCP/IP compliant network, such as the Internet. It should be appreciated that each of the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, business service provider system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (also referred to herein as &ldquo;workstations&rdquo;) may be remotely located from each other and may be controlled by separate entities. Alternatively, permutations of each of the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, business service provider system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be commonly controlled and/or located at a single entity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may interface with the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in real time via a web browser or other TCP/IP compliant software. The biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may comprise computing devices with appropriate network interface hardware and software for establishing a TCP/IP session with a web server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and for executing an application for interfacing with the web server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The application may be typical HTML Internet web browser software, such as Netscape Navigator&trade; or Microsoft Internet Explorer&trade;, which is capable of receiving HTML documents from the web server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and returning HTTP posts to the web server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that such HTML interface enables an operator of a biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or payor system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to read, write, manipulate data, and otherwise interact with the ASP in real time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and payor system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may also interface with the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> utilizing a batch interface for exchanging large quantities of data in data files of a predetermined format. The batch interface may use TCP/IP or other network type sockets or may utilize a dedicated network circuit such as a value added network (VAN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The business service provider system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be an exchange or other service bureau application providing a plurality of business processing services to its clients (which may include the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). One such business processing service may be electronic bill presentment and payment, as may be provided using a system and/or method consistent with the invention. In such a configuration, from the point of view of the service provider system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be a back end system for performing such bill presentment and payment portions of the overall services. The service provider system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may communicate with the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> utilizing data files with a predefined format to assure that the content of such data files may be recognized by the intended hardware and/or software. The predetermined data file may be a data file with each data element including a label or tag to identify the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A typical language for structuring such tagged field data files is known as the extensible markup language (XML) and the predetermined data structure is known as a schema. The data is referred to as an XML message. Utilizing the Internet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the service provider system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may establish a TCP/IP session and exchange XML messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that, in an alternative embodiment, a biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or a payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may operate an accounting system interface application rather than a web browser. In this case, the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will communicate with the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> utilizing XML messages, and the XML communication may be similar to that which may occur between the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the service provider system <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Such an accounting system interface application may enable the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to avoid manually reading data from an HTML document and manually re-entering into an accounting system. More specifically, the XML messages may be used to directly input content into the accounting system or, at a minimum, automatically populate content onto an accounting system data entry screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may comprise one or more web servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> coupled to a secured zone network <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> between two routers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> serving as firewalls, one for protecting the internal private network <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and one for blocking unauthorized Internet access. This zone <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is often referred to idiomatically as a DMZ (i.e. &ldquo;de-militarized zone&rdquo;). It is noted that one or more firewalls may be placed between any one of a number of components of the present invention for security purposes. In this standard firewall configuration of a DMZ <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the web servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the Internet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a first router <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and coupled to a private network <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by a second router <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. On the &ldquo;front end&rdquo;, the web servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may establish the TCP/IP sessions and communicate with the biller systems <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, payer systems <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and business service provider systems <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as described above. On the back end, the web servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may use XML messages to make remote processing calls (RPCs) to an application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (described hereinbelow in further detail) and may receive XML response messages to such calls. An invoice loader <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (described hereinbelow in further detail) may be provided for transmitting batch input to a database server <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which may store invoice and other financial, transactional, or non-financial data. Those skilled in the art will recognize that such data may be generated by one of any number of billing systems, e.g., SAP, Oracle Financials, J D Edwards, People Soft, Great Plains, etc. The data outputted by these billing systems and input into the system may come in a variety of formats including raw data, print file format, and X-12 ANSI 810 (EDI). The database server <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may include a database application <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (described hereinbelow in further detail) for reading and writing to the raw data stored on the magnetic media of the database. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary fundamental operation of a web server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of this invention is shown. A TCP/IP session may be established at step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a remote client, which includes appropriate exchanges of passwords and/or other authentication messages to verify that the remote client has authorized access. Clients may be either workstations which interface with the server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> using a browser interface, or, alternatively, software clients which interface with the server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> using XML messages. Step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> represents a determination as to whether the remote client is operating a web browser or whether the client is operating an XML enabled application. If the remote client is operating a web browser, the server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may send out an initial HTML document to the client at step <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. This initial document may be the main menu page that the operator at the remote client might expect to see immediately after logging onto the system utilizing the browser. The server may then receive an HTTP post from the remote client at step <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and, in response to such HTTP post, build an XML message for making a remote processing call to the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the XML message is based on the content of the post and a predetermined schema for the function that the operator of the remote client has requested via the HTTP post. For example, if the operator had selected to view a list of open invoices from the HTML menu document, the server might build an XML message for requesting open invoices from the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> based on the schema for viewing a list of open invoices in response to the HTTP post. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> represents the server making an XML remote processing call to the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> utilizing the XML message. An XML response message may be received back from the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The web server may then utilize the content of the XML response message to build an HTML document to send to the remote client in response to the remote client&apos;s HTTP post at step <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. More specifically, each web server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may include a style sheet database <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that stores style sheets for various documents that may be sent to remote clients and may provide different style sheets for the same document based on different clients. As such, the branding, look and feel, and layout of documents may be varied on a client-by-client basis. The step of building an HTML document may therefore also include selecting a style sheet corresponding to the remote client and combining the style sheet with the content of the XML response message to build the HTML document. The style sheet may include data fields and building the HTML document may include populating the style sheet by matching data elements from the response message with fields on the style sheet. The HTML document may then be sent to the remote client at step <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and, returning to step <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, another HTTP post may be received and the foregoing steps repeated for that HTTP post. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Because it is envisioned that the operator of the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) may provide electronic bill presentment and payment services to several of it suppliers, each operating a payor system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, it is envisioned that style sheets will be common to all biller systems <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and payor systems <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when interfacing with the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with respect to reading, writing, and manipulating data at the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> related to amounts due to the biller operating the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In which case, a style sheet is selected by identifying the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> utilizing an element of the response message and selecting a style sheet corresponding to such biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Similarly, it is envisioned that he operator of a payor system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may provide electronic bill and payment services to several of its customers, each operating a biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that style sheets will be common to all biller systems <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and payor systems <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when interfacing with the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with respect to reading, writing, and manipulating data at the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> related to amounts due to the biller operating the biller system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from such operator of the payor system <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> providign the services to its customers. In which case, a style sheet is selected by identifying the payor system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> utilizing an element of the response message and selecting a style sheet corresponding to such payor system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, if at step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> the remote client is determined to be a client utilizing an XML enabled application instead of a web browser, the web server may send an initial XML message to the remote client at step <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The web server may then receive an XML message from the remote client at step <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and validate the XML message at step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. If necessary, the content may be transformed into an XML message compliant with the schema needed for making a remote processing call to the application server at step <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> if it did not validate at step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The schema-compliant XML message may then be used to make the remote processing call to the application server at step <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, a response XML message may be received from the application server, and, at step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the response XML message may be returned to the remote client. Thereafter, returning to step <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, another XML message may be received and the foregoing steps may be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the above description represents an exemplary process utilized for interacting with each remote client. In operation, the server may be operating with a plurality of remote clients simultaneously and/or utilizing a multi-tasking based operating environment. Furthermore, a plurality of web servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, each communicating with a plurality of different clients, may each be capable of making XML calls to the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to perform the above described functions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Application Server </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may perform the main processing of the business functions carried out by the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may operate within a hardware and software environment. The software environment may comprise a plurality of applications that may be object-oriented and/or table-driven, whereby new products, applications, modules and/or transaction types may easily be integrated. Such software components may include, e.g., an operating environment <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> (e.g. Microsoft Windows NT&trade;, Windows 2000&trade;, or Sun Solaris&trade;), transaction processing software (e.g. Microsoft Transaction Server&trade;), communications software, database tools (e.g. RogueWave&trade;), query and/or reporting software (e.g. Seagate&apos;s Crystal Reports&trade;), a database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a business function selection object <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, one or more business objects <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and/or one or more other applications, which may be table-driven. As described hereinbelow with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may verify access levels of clients accessing the web servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as well as verify the format of XML messages and build appropriate messages to pass to the appropriate selection objects <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The transaction processing software may be a component-based transaction processing application for developing, deploying, and managing high performance, scalable, and robust enterprise, Internet, and intranet server applications, which defines an application programming model for developing distributed, component-based applications and provides a run-time infrastructure for deploying and managing these applications. A clustering application may optionally be provided for load balancing and fail-over services to cluster distributed application servers into a single, high-performance, highly available environment of application server resources, thereby avoiding bandwidth, latency, and congestion problems and providing multi-server scalability for unlimited concurrent user access. The query and/or reporting software may be an application or object providing for an environment in which client reports and file download formats are easily customizable. One or more business objects <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> or applications may reside on the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, such business objects <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> or applications being the components that perform the central transactional functions of the server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The business objects may receive XML messages in a predefined format and return XML response messages in a predefined format. Menus of options (as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> land described hereinbelow) may be made available to the client by the message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (or, as those skilled in the art will recognize, by one of any number of components of the invention, e.g., selector or another business object). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As discussed hereinbelow, exemplary business objects may include an object for reviewing invoices, an object for making adjustments to invoices, and an object for initiating invoice payment. One or more of any of the foregoing described applications may access the database server <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via the database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and/or database application <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for purposes of retrieving and modifying its data. Other applications may be provided, consistent with the provision of billing, payment, or other financial or non-financial services. For example, an e-mail notice application may be provided for sending e-mail notices of the invoices to one or more payer systems <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are set up to receive e-mail notices. While the foregoing components of the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be referred to herein as &ldquo;applications&rdquo;, &ldquo;modules&rdquo;, &ldquo;components&rdquo;, &ldquo;interfaces&rdquo;, and/or &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that such labels should not be construed in any way to be limitations. Any of the components of the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may comprise machine-readable programming code embodied in a tangible medium, e.g., Java beans. Depending on whether the embodiment of the invention is object-oriented, such components may or may not be formal objects. A table at the end of this Detailed Description lists exemplary objects and corresponding XML messages in one embodiment of the invention. It is noted that the business objects of the present invention should be modular, i.e., functionality may be added to, deleted from, or modified in the system by adding or removing business objects. Thus, each business object should be constructed with expected input and output data only, as though it were a &ldquo;black box&rdquo;. The internal processes of each business object &ldquo;black box&rdquo; are not relevant to the overall operation or maintenance of the system, to the extent that any business object with a given set of expected input and output data may be substituted for an existing business object for performing a similar or identical function having the same set of expected input and output data, wherein the system need not ever require knowledge of the internal operation of the business object for proper functioning or maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which illustrates an exemplary operation of the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in one embodiment of the invention, in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the general operation of the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will now be described. First, an XML remote processing call may be received at step <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from one of the web servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may receive from the web servers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> either an XML message from the software client or an HTTP post from the workstation client. If an XML message is received from a software client, the message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may verify that the particular client has appropriate access levels for sending such XML message, thereby preventing a person from manually writing an XML message for an option that is outside of the permitted workflow for the client. After verifying access levels, the message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may verify that the XML message is the exact format needed for passing to the selection object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. If not, data may be extracted and the appropriate message is built. The message may then be passed to the selection object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which may pass the message to the appropriate business object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for execution. In the case of an HTTP post from a workstation, the message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may build an XML message for performing the transaction based on the post and the access levels. The message may then be passed to the selection object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, which may pass the message to the appropriate business object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A business function selection object <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may then make a call at step <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to the appropriate business object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> associated with the XML call. The selected business function object may execute and generate at step <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> XML calls to the database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, in turn, may utilize predefined instructions at step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> for directing the database server <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to access and/or write data into the database tables. In one embodiment, the predefined instructions may be a group of instructions, e.g., SQL calls. It is noted, however, that the business function objects <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may not directly perform the SQL calls at step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> object may exist so that the relational structure of the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be modified without modifying each of the business function objects <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Each database relational structure may merely need to be defined in a database structure file (not shown) that may be used by the database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> object to structure the appropriate SQL calls for execution at step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. A response to the SQL call may then be received at step <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> from the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. A single XML call at step <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> from a business function object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may cause the database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> object to initiate several SQL calls at step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Therefore, if more than one SQL call is necessary (as determined at step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>), a plurality of such calls may be initiated at step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, as necessary, and the corresponding responses may be received at step <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Once the database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> object has completed the SQL calls at step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, it may build (at step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>) and return (at step <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>) a response XML message to the business function object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The response XML message may then be received at step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> by the business function object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. A business function object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may need to initiate several XML calls to the database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> object during performance of the selected business function, at step <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Therefore, if more than one XML call is necessary (as determined at step <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>), a plurality of such calls may be initiated at step <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, as necessary, and the corresponding database calls may be generated (at step <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>) and may be received (at step <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>), and appropriate XML responses may be built (at step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>), returned (at step <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>), and received (at step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>). Once the XML calls to the database interface have been completed at step <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, (i.e. the business function has been completed), the business function object <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may build a response XML message at step <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and may return the XML response message to the web server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and the foregoing steps repeated for a subsequent XML remote processing call which may be received at step <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Invoice Loader </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which illustrates an exemplary invoice loading operation in one embodiment of the invention, in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the general invoice loader <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> operation will now be described. The invoice loader <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> module may provide batch input to the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This may be useful because many enterprise accounting systems may export an invoice file on a periodic basis. The batch invoice file may then be sent at step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the invoice loader module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> via one of any number of means <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, e.g., as an e-mail attachment, FTP load, an EDI VAN (value added network), or another private network link. Therefore, the invoice loader module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may include a network interface (not shown) for coupling to the Internet and may include one or more private network interfaces (not shown) for coupling to EDI VAN&apos;s or other private network interfaces. Each of these network interfaces may be a network card, or may comprise such other hardware and software as may be appropriate to effect the network interconnection. Alternatively, the invoice loader module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may couple only to a local area network <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the processing facility (i.e. at the geographic location of the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>), and one or more routers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the DMZ <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may serve to couple the invoice loader <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the Internet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and to each private network, as may be appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Once the invoice loader module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> receives the invoice file at step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it may verify that the file is in the appropriate invoice loader format at step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Typically, the biller may be responsible for running the necessary translation program to convert the invoice file from the biller&apos;s accounting system to the invoice loader format. However, it may be possible for the file to arrive at the invoice loader module in the accounting system format, in which case the invoice loader module may then identify the accounting system format and run an appropriate translation program at step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to convert to invoice loader format. Exemplary formats from which invoices may be loaded include ANSI X12 810, flat ASCII files, or well formed XML schemas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Once the invoice file is in the invoice loader format, the invoice loader module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may enter the invoices into the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and may, if appropriate, send out e-mail notices at step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to one or more payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> users indicating that an invoice is available. To this end, the invoice loader module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may therefore include an invoice loader application <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The invoice loader application <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> may make appropriate calls to a database application <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for loading the invoices. More specifically, the database application <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, which may run on the database server <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (or, alternatively, on the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>), may provide for the raw data stored on the magnetic media to be logically accessible in a relational database table format. Predefined instructions for accessing and writing data into the tables may be sent to the database application <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the predefined instructions may be a group of instructions, e.g., SQL calls. The invoice loader application <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> may therefore execute appropriate SQL calls for writing the invoice data to the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Once the invoice data is in the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, e-mail notices of the invoices may be sent out to one or more payer system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> users who are set up to receive e-mail notices at step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. An e-mail notice application <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be provided on the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for making appropriate SQL calls to the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Such calls may be made for purposes of detecting new invoices at step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as well as determining, based on the identity of the payer, if an e-mail notice is required, at step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the e-mail notice application <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may search the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for a flag or other identifier of a new invoice, and then, for each new invoice, may obtain data from a payer&apos;s profile indicating whether an e-mail notice is appropriate, and if appropriate, the address to which the e-mail notice should be sent. The e-mail notice application <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may then send the e-mail. Alternatively, the e-mail notice application <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may run on the invoice loader module <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> instead of running on the application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Database Server </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The database server <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be an OLTP (on-line transaction processing) system, embodied in a server, such as Microsoft SQL Server 7&trade;, Oracle 8&trade;, Sybase Adaptive Server R12&trade;, DB2&trade;, Informix&trade;, or another ODBC-compliant database. The database server <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be configurable for sharing with other applications, including access by a report writer application, and may comprise a distribution and replication protocol (DRP) device. A backup database server (not shown) may also be provided, wherein some or all of the data on the database server may be mirrored to the backup database server. In this configuration, in the event an application performing a transaction on the database server experiences failure, the application may start at the backup server location and proceed from the point of failure, thereby preserving transaction integrity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be a relational database, i.e., data management technology modeled such that all data is organized as though it is formatted into tables, with the table columns representing the table&apos;s fields or domains and the table rows representing the values of the table&apos;s fields or domains. Data between tables may be related to one another, using, for example, pointer data. Data may be logically organized as tables but not necessarily physically stored as such. The database interface <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may access and update data via a language interface or &ldquo;structured query language&rdquo; (SQL) calls. The database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may comprise a relational database where the payer and biller profiles (which may include access control data and/or dispute rules) may be related between payer systems <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and biller systems <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may retrieve access control data from the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> when a workstation client logs on. Similarly, business service provider profiles may be stored in the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and may include access control data for one or more business service providers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Invoice data stored on the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may include invoice-specific data received from the biller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> each time the biller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> sends an invoice to the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Such data may include, e.g., the identity of the biller and payer, invoice line items, and settlement and payment options. Biller profile data may be stored on the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and may include items that a biller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> need only enter once, and may change only periodically thereafter. Such items may include dispute rules and access levels for each biller workstation with system access. The dispute rules may be payer-specific or may be may applied globally to all payers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Payer profile data may be stored on the database <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and may include items that a payer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> need only enter once, and may change only periodically thereafter. Such items may include access levels for each payer logon ID (referred to as a payer workstation) with system access. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Client Types </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, two client types may access the ASP <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a workstation client (e.g. a browser) interfacing with the system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> utilizing HTML documents and HTTP posts, and a software client interfacing with the system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> utilizing XML messages. Both billers and payers may comprise workstation clients, and the message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may present different work flow options to each via menus. Host (or &ldquo;administrator&rdquo;) users and help desk users may be biller or payer workstations having access levels which are a subset of all access options available to the biller or payer. Host users (who may be affiliated with a business service provider system) may control most non-invoice related data and functionality. A biller system user may control invoice related data and functionality associated with a specific billing company. A payer system user may have specific functionality associated with all related invoice transactions to the paying company. Help desk users may be provided access to the system in order to troubleshoot users&apos; questions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The application server <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may authenticate each client via a logon process, and each client may have a specific set of access levels for performing certain functions, which may be a subset of all of the functions available to the particular biller, payer or business provider. The message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may maintain a table of access levels for each client which is currently logged into the system. With respect to transaction requests, when an HTTP post is received from a workstation or an XML message is received from an application client, the message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may only build the XML message from the HTTP (or pass the XML message received) if the client has appropriate access levels. With respect to responding to a transaction request, the message parser/builder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may control the clients&apos; work flow and limit the menu choices which appear in the outbound XML message to those that would be available as next steps in the work flow for the particular client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The system may permit a user (i.e. the operator of a biller, payer or business service provider workstation) to gain access by clicking on a &ldquo;login&rdquo; button on the initial screen, or by going directly to the logon URL without having to navigate through the initial pages by simply entering the full URL in the browser, &ldquo;bookmarking&rdquo; the page, or using a &ldquo;favorites&rdquo;-type feature of the browser. The system may present the user with a logon page, wherein he or she must specify a valid user ID and password to gain access. If an invalid ID or password is entered, the user may be told that an invalid ID/password was entered. In one embodiment, if a user enters a valid user ID and an invalid password five times in a row, the system may &ldquo;disable&rdquo; the user ID (i.e. the system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will not present the workstation defined by the ID with other system options until another workstation, with appropriate access levels, performs a function to reset the &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; account). If, after this period, the user enters a valid ID and password, the system may display a message indicating that their account has been disabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Alternative authentication methods may include any method of verifying the identity of a user or a component of the invention and may include a security mechanism such as one or more of a digital signature, a PIN number, a password, a smart card, or a &ldquo;master&rdquo; or &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; key. In one embodiment of the invention, an XML script may create a Java applet that monitors the active application and interacts with a separate security server residing within the application server. The Java applet may be configurable to interrupt the current application to prompt for authentication, such as by a digital signature, a PIN number, a password, or a master key, and to communicate with the security server to effect the authentication. If the security operation is successful, the application may continue without interruption; otherwise, the application may be terminated according to the XML script. Alternatively, the foregoing process or a part thereof may be used for transferring data between any two components in an embodiment of the present invention, including those external to the invention, such as an end user, a client, a financial institution, a back office, an administrator, an e-mail or fax recipient, or a server. One or more of the foregoing security operations may be implemented using application security middleware, such as Ubizen&apos;s MultiSecure&trade; ETS, MultiSecure&trade; ASE, or MultiSecure&trade; WAC. Further security means may comprise one or more of the following: password or PIN number protection, use of a semiconductor, magnetic or other physical key device, biometric methods (including fingerprint, nailbed, palm, iris, or retina scanning, handwriting analysis, handprint recognition, voice recognition, or facial imaging), or other log-on security measures known in the art. Password protection may include certain validity requirements upon establishing a password, e.g., disallowing more than two consecutive characters in a password, disallowing the same password for a minimum of six consecutive password changes, and/or disallowing more than one user-initiated password change per day. Passwords may be set to expire after a certain number of days, and an inactive user account may be set to expire or become disabled after a certain number of days of nonuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Following logon, as described above, a user may be presented with predetermined work flow options based on the access levels available for his or her particular workstation. </paragraph>

The system may provide a view options page <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> to allow the user control over the subset of data that will be displayed and the order in which the data will be presented. To further facilitate the presentation of invoices, the system may permit settings associated with a specific report to be automatically saved and used again the next time the user generates the report. Considering the time it may take to generate certain reports (e.g. lengthy reports), the system may also provide an option to bring this page up before running a report, to limit the scope and time. The view options page may consist of three exemplary areas: filter, sort and options. In the filter area, the system may provide the following exemplary choices: by date (past due, eligible for discount, due within xxx days); and by status (paid invoices, adjusted invoices, unpaid invoices, paid through another source); and by payer (all payer, specific payer); and by attribute range between xxx and yyy (none, invoice numbers, store/location, purchase orders, purchase request number, invoice issue dates, dollar amount, bill of lading numbers, receiving location zipcodes, invoice aging). The system may also provide the ability to search for invoice number, store or location number, routing number and P.O. number, by using wildcards. The system may provide a sort area to allow returned results to be sorted in ascending or descending order according to the following exemplary criteria: due date, invoice number, invoice date, purchase order number, net amount due, store or location number, and invoice aging. In one embodiment, the system may allow sorting criteria and order to be determined by a sort order combo box, which may default to ascending, and three sort criteria boxes, the first of which defaults to due date, while the rest default to no sort criteria (spaces). The system may provide an options area with the following exemplary choices: display all in one page or show count (with the default being all in one page), remember and use previous settings, and show view options page before presentation. The system may be adapted to store filter, sort, and options data as global information on the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The system may allow a biller system user to select an option to display a page <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> for listing invoices matching specified criteria. The system may display at this screen the filter/sort criteria that are in use for this display. The system may display invoices using a paging concept (i.e. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>). When displaying invoices, the system may remove any existing navigation area, so as to optimize the invoice display area. In one embodiment, the system may display a page separated into two sections, with the header section containing non-scrolling data and/or buttons and the body section that scrolls as necessary, depending upon the width of the browser window and the number of invoices being displayed. The header section may contain the following elements: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The user&apos;s selection criteria, i.e., All Invoices-Past due. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The display range text in the format of first-last of maximum, i.e., <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Next &lsquo;n&rsquo;&rdquo; may cause the system to navigate the user to the next &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices, i.e., &ldquo;Next <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. If the last &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices are currently being displayed the system may disable the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Previous &lsquo;n&rsquo;&rdquo; may cause the system to navigate the user to the previous &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices, i.e., &ldquo;Previous <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. If the first &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices are currently being displayed the system may disable the &ldquo;Previous&rdquo; button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;All&rdquo; may cause the system to change the mode from displaying a page of invoices to displaying all invoices, and the system may label the button &ldquo;Page&rdquo;, i.e., <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. If the &ldquo;Page&rdquo; button is selected, the system may display at this page the first &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices, and system may label the button &ldquo;All&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Back&rdquo; may cause the system to return to the previous screen, step, or function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Search&rdquo; may cause the system to perform a search in the current invoice list by using the &ldquo;Find&rdquo; feature. The system may permit only the invoices currently being displayed to be searched. The system may allow the user to type a string to search for before selecting the &ldquo;Search&rdquo; button. The system may search each invoice may for the specified string. If a match is found, the system may scroll the invoice record into view and select the text found. Selecting &ldquo;Search&rdquo; again may cause the system to find the next instance of the string. The system may permit wildcard searches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Show Selected&rdquo; may cause the system to display all invoices that have been manually checked. In the last column of the invoice list, the system may allow a user to select individual invoices. While the user remains on this page, the system may maintain in a list all invoices that are marked as selected. If the user switches the context of this view, the system may not remove any selection made by the user. Clicking on the &ldquo;Show Selected&rdquo; button may cause the system to display all the invoices the user has selected. The system may change this button to either &ldquo;Page&rdquo; or &ldquo;All&rdquo;, depending on the state of the selection when this button was pressed. Selecting this button again may cause the system to return the invoice list to its previous mode. The system may display all selected invoices, even if they exceed the page limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Close&rdquo; <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> may cause the system to mark as closed all invoices that are selected. The system may display to the user a confirmation message before the invoices are closed, e.g., &ldquo;You have selected 24 invoices to close. Are you sure you want to close these invoices&quest;&rdquo; The system may not permit closed invoices to appear in any active queries. The system may subject invoices that are marked as closed to host archiving and purging criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Paid Through Another Source&rdquo; may be provided by the system as an option for the biller system user to mark an invoice as closed by selecting desired invoices and clicking on the &ldquo;Paid through another source&rdquo; button. Once this occurs, the system may, for the invoices in question, update their audit trail to reflect that they were paid outside the system, and then change their status to &ldquo;Closed&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In the body section, the system may display all invoices in table format. The width of the table columns may be proportional to the width of the browser window. If the browser window is narrowed, the system may decrease column widths appropriately and wrap text within each column, as necessary. If an invoice has adjustments, the system may highlight that line in color to indicate this fact. The system may link the invoice number field to the invoice detail page. The system may link the status field to the invoice history page, at which the system may display a full status history for the selected invoice. By default, the system may display the following exemplary columns: payer name, invoice number, due date, status, net amount due, amount to pay, P.O. number, P.O. requisition number, store number, and select. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The system may permit the biller system user to select an option to display the details of a selected invoice, which may cause the system to direct the user to an invoice detail section <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The system may use one or more predetermined, customizable and/or selectable template schema (which may be stored as global information on the database) to format the biller detail, and the system may provide a single biller multiple templates from which to select. The invoice detail page may contain various sections. One section may display summary information for the selected invoice, information about the biller, information about the particular invoice, and/or information about the payer. The system may provide selectable buttons for obtaining more information about the current invoice, e.g., items <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, messages <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, e-mail <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight>, status <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, shipping info <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>, discounts <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, and notes <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>. The system may display line items that have been adjusted in a different color. Upon selection by a user of the items button <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the system may toggle the header view from showing a detailed header description to allowing the user to perform basic search operations on the details of this invoice. The items button <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> may cause the system to toggle to header. Clicking on the header button may cause the system to return to the previous view, thereby providing more space for viewing details on the current page, as follows. Another section may contain the line items that make up the invoice. The system may color code highlight line items that have been adjusted. Each line may have a clickable line number. Clicking a line item&apos;s number may cause the system to expand the line to show its detail. Clicking a particular adjustment may cause the system to display a window with details about that specific adjustment. Another section may contain the invoice summary. For both the original amount billed and the amount to pay, the system may calculate and display the following: gross total invoice; time conditional discount; other discount/charge; a general adjustments link displays the general adjustment that was entered for this invoice (the system may only present this link if this invoice has a general adjustment; the system may show each general adjustment separately; and the system may permit general adjustments to be removed); sales tax; other tax; and net amount due. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The system may, upon selection of the messages button <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, display a new browser window <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> allowing the biller system user to enter a new message for the payer associated with the current invoice. The system may permit new messages to be entered into a textbox and sent by pressing a &ldquo;save&rdquo; button. The system may provide a &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; button for discarding the current message and returning to the invoice detail page. The system may provide a discounts button <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> for opening a separate browser window <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> displaying discounts information for the current invoice, including, e.g., time conditional discount %; time conditional discount amount; time conditional discount date; invoice date; and unconditional discount or charge. The system may provide a shipping info button <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>, which may cause the system to display additional shipping information for this invoice in a separate browser window <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>, including, e.g., ship to location, date shipped, carrier, bill of lading number, terms, units, unit code, weight, volume, package dimensions, package contents, and notes. The system may provide a notes button <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> for opening a separate browser window <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight> containing a list of entered notes for this invoice. In the separate browser window, the system may permit the user to enter new notes into a new note textbox and save them by clicking an &ldquo;add note&rdquo; button. Clicking a &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; button may cause the system to return the user to the invoice detail page, discarding any new notes. The system may automatically log adjustment notes and biller disputes as notes for the current invoice. The system may provide an e-mail button <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> for opening a separate browser window <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> with a new e-mail referencing the selected invoice. The system may permit the user to enter an e-mail message to selected users about the current invoice. The system may permit e-mail to be sent to the recipients that are picked from the recipients list, the contents of which may be based on the e-mail distribution list set up by the payer system administrator. The system may provide a status button <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> for opening a separate browser window <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> displaying a page containing the status history for the selected invoice, including, e.g., date/time, user ID, and user name and status. The system may further provide adjustment buttons, e.g., general adjustment <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>, quantity adjustment <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight>, price adjustment <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, and allowance <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, at the invoice detail <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> section. The system may permit a general adjustment button <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> to be selected to open a separate browser window <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight> containing general adjustment information for this invoice. This information may be read-only and may include the following exemplary items of information: adjustment amount, reason code, and notes. The system may permit a quantity adjustment button <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight> to be selected for a specific invoice line item to open a separate browser window <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight> containing quantity adjustment information for that line item. This information may be read only and may include the following exemplary items of information: adjustment quantity, reason code, and notes.

This information may be read only and may include the following exemplary items of information: allowance amount, reason code, and notes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The system may make other options available to the biller system user for selection, e.g. an items button for displaying the invoice details in item view. The system may, upon selection of such an button, remove the header from the invoice details and all but the net amount due field of the footer, thereby allowing more screen space to be used for the presentation of invoices. The system may provide a search function for performing a search in the current invoice list. The system may permit only the invoices currently being displayed to be searched. The system may allow the user to type a string to search for before selecting the &ldquo;Search&rdquo; button. The system may search each invoice may for the specified string. If a match is found, the system may scroll the invoice record into view and select the text found. Selecting &ldquo;Search&rdquo; again may cause the system to find the next instance of the string. The system may permit wildcard searches. The system may provide clickable line numbers in the items view line, whereby upon clicking a line item&apos;s number, the system may expand the line to show its invoices, and clicking a particular adjustment may cause the system to bring up a window with details about that specific adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The system may permit the biller system user to select an option <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> to retrieve all closed invoices in the system subject to the criteria set in the view options page and may provide the additional option of restoring selected invoices that have been closed into the current collection. The system may move invoices that have been checked to the open state when the user selects an &ldquo;open&rdquo; button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The system may permit the biller system user to select an option <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> to export files, i.e. to download data directly from the server, bypassing the need to have the data flow through a transmission to the biller system user. Selecting the export files option <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> may cause the system to direct the user to the invoice export section <highlight><bold>633</bold></highlight>, from which the user may either edit export templates or export files. Upon selection of edit export templates, the system may allow the biller system user to edit the templates used in file export. An export templates listbox may show the present export templates while a template settings area may contain all the attributes and settings of the current selected template. Upon selection of a template from the export templates listbox, the system may populate the fields of the template settings area. In this area, the system may allow the biller system user to add, modify, or delete file export templates by using a set of buttons or controls. The set of invoices to be exported may be based on the invoices that are being viewed at the time export is chosen. The system may permit the user to set that filter through the filter/sort page. The template settings area may contain the following exemplary controls (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database): fields and export order (may contain a listbox of the available invoice fields and an ordered listbox of fields marked for export with two buttons for moving fields between listboxes; up and down buttons may allow the field export order to be changed); and file formats (a listbox that allows the file format to be selected; if ASCII is chosen a delimiter section may be displayed and the user may need to select field and record delimiters). The system may provide a &ldquo;set default&rdquo; button for allowing the user to set the current template as the default template for the file export page. Upon selecting file export, the system may allow the biller system user to export invoices based on an export template. In the templates listbox, the system may show the present export templates while the export range may allow the user to select the date range criteria for including invoices in the export. In the templates list, the system may default to the template set as default from the edit export templates page; if no default template was set, the system may select the first entry in the listbox. An &ldquo;export&rdquo; button may cause the system to perform the file export, while a &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; button may cause the system to abort. The system may be adapted to export files in such exemplary formats as <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> for invoices, <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> for payments, XML, delimited files, and fixed-length PayBase&trade; compatible files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The system may permit the biller system user to select a reports option <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, which may cause the system to display subcategories that correspond to the available reports. Exemplary reports may include: paid invoices <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight>, total invoices <highlight><bold>642</bold></highlight>, adjusted invoices <highlight><bold>643</bold></highlight>, pending invoices <highlight><bold>644</bold></highlight>, closed invoices <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight>, credit notes <highlight><bold>646</bold></highlight>, and statistics <highlight><bold>647</bold></highlight>. Other exemplary reports may include cashflow forecasting, aged outstanding invoice, returned items, modified invoice history, biller profile maintenance, payment history, and outstanding invoice status. The system may permit the user to select from among various reporting options and/or filters <highlight><bold>648</bold></highlight> (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database), and the system may then generate a report <highlight><bold>649</bold></highlight> for viewing and/or printing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Biller System Administration Workflow </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary biller system administration workflow in one embodiment of the system. From the administration <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> screen, the system may permit a biller system administrator to select from among functions including, e.g., edit biller profile <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, archive/purge <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, edit banks <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, edit users <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, edit event e-mails <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, edit payers <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, adjustments <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, edit export template <highlight><bold>733</bold></highlight>, and password/profile change <highlight><bold>735</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Upon selection by the biller system administrator of the edit biller profile <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> function, the system may redirect the biller system administrator to a biller profile section <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> for editing the biller&apos;s profile information. The system may permit company data to be entered and/or edited for the following exemplary fields (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database): name, address, city, state, zip, country, SIC code, TIN, and default template type. From the biller profile section <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, the system may permit the biller system administrator to select a function for editing logos and websites, which may cause the system to direct the administrator to a logo and website editing page <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, wherein the administrator may edit the biller&apos;s logos and available websites (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database). The system may display a list of billers, and the selection of a biller from the list may cause the system to populate the company information area with details about the current biller. For each biller, the system may permit a list of company logos and websites to be edited. The system may permit new logos to be made available to the system with an &ldquo;add&rdquo; button for uploading the logo file, and the system may likewise permit logos to be removed from the system with a &ldquo;remove&rdquo; button. The system may display a list of websites via a listbox containing the sites and a site details edit area. Selecting a website in the list may cause the system to populate the site details section. The system may permit the URL, description, and type of website to be edited. The system may provide a delete button for removing a site from the list and a save button for saving the current website. The system may provide a new site button for emptying the edit area to allow a new site to be entered and saved. The system may provide selectable links for accessing the biller&apos;s enrollment page and biller profile page. The system may permit the administrator to select a template editing function, which may cause the system to direct the user to a template editing section <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>. In the template editing section, the system may permit one or more predetermined, customizable and/or selectable template schema (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database) to be established and/or edited to format the biller detail, and the system may provide a single biller multiple templates from which to select. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The system may permit the administrator to select an archive/purge <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> function, wherein the system may direct the administrator to an archive/purge section <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. In this section, the system may permit the administrator to select functions for archiving (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database), including archiving data to a separate table, modifying options controlling when archiving is to occur (e.g. if an invoice stays in the &ldquo;Presented&rdquo; or &ldquo;Viewed&rdquo; state for more than X days; if an invoice stays in the &ldquo;Paid&rdquo; state for more than X days; and/or when an invoice is closed, it may be automatically archived); and reporting against archived data. The system may provide purging features (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database), including purging records only from the archive table(s); modifying options controlling when to purge (e.g. purge records after X days in archive; or manual purge). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Upon selection by the biller system administrator of the edit banks <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> function, the system may redirect the biller system administrator to a biller bank editing section <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> for allowing the bank information associated with the biller to be edited. It is contemplated that a biller may have multiple banks with each bank having multiple bank accounts. An exemplary edit banks <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> section may be separated into two sections. In the first section, the system may display the following exemplary fields (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database): name, address, city, state, zip code, country, country&num;, account &num; and RTN. The system may utilize a MOD9 or similar algorithm to verify valid routing numbers. In a second section, the system may display for the selected bank a &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; list-box populated with all bank holidays associated with this bank. Selecting an existing bank holiday from this list box may cause the system to delete the entry. Selecting a delete button may cause the system to delete the selected bank holiday. The system may provide combo-boxes for month, day and year selection. Selecting an add button may cause the system to add the selected date to the holiday list-box. If a bank is added with, or is caused to have no holidays through later modification, the system may display a warning to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The system may permit the administrator to select a &ldquo;users&rdquo; <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> function, wherein the system may direct the administrator to an edit user section <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. In this section, the system may permit the administrator to add, modify or delete users associated with the current biller. At this page, the system may display the name of the biller at the top to establish the context of the edit. The system may populate a list box with the selected biller system&apos;s user names. As the administrator clicks on each user, the system may display the user&apos;s information in a user information section. The system may permit the administrator to add a new user to the current biller by entering information into the user information section. The system may require that the combination of last name, middle initial and first name be unique. The system may permit modify and delete operations to be performed on the currently selected user. The system may provide a checkbox for temporarily deactivating a user. The system may maintain contact information (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database), including, e.g., last name, first, middle, phone, fax, e-mail, e-mail2, user ID, password, confirmation, language and privilege group. The system may require certain fields for user information, such as last name, first name, e-mail and phone. The system may provide a reset password button for resetting the selected user&apos;s password to the default setting. The system may automatically send an e-mail to a new user after they have been added, telling the user how to connect and logon to the system. As described above with reference to the host user modifying privilege information, the system may similarly permit a biller system administrator to access a permissions section <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> for modifying permission/privilege information (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Upon selection by the biller system administrator of the event e-mails <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> function, the system may direct the biller system administrator to an event e-mail section <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>. In this section, the system may permit biller system users to be associated with specific system events, which associations the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database. Any time one of these specific events occurs, the system may generate an automatic e-mail and send it to the selected list of biller system users. For example, exemplary distribution list choices may include: invoices loaded successfully, invoices loaded unsuccessfully, invoice adjusted, payment authorized, payment canceled, payment completed, and payment notification. The system may display on this page a list-box that contains all biller system users currently in the selected distribution list and a list-box that contains all biller system users currently not in the selected distribution list. In one embodiment, the system may provide two buttons to allow users to be added or removed from the distribution list. The system may permit a default e-mail address to be set up for each event, e.g. the biller system administrator. The system may permit the user to remove this value and/or add to the list. The system may send an automatic e-mail to one or more biller system users when a payment is made. The system may send a summary of the payments made to each biller that has payments in the given payment run. The system may send to designated biller system users an e-mail with the following exemplary information: summary of payments made on today&apos;s date, payer name; payer number; total number of payments; and total amount of payments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The system may further direct the biller system administrator, upon selection of the payers feature <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, to selections for performing tasks including options <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, adjustments <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight>, close invoices <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> and e-mail <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight>. Selecting the options <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> task may direct the biller system administrator to a payer options <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> section, where options for a specific payer may be entered and/or edited. The system may display, at the payer options page, a list-box with all the payers related to the biller, with the system pre-selecting the most recently selected payer in this session by default. If no payer has previously been selected, then the system may not pre-select a payer in the list box. For the selected payer, the system may display the following exemplary payer options (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database): hide line items from invoice listing; allow payments; include signature; web site selection (which may be displayed using one or more multiple select listboxes); logo selection; payer ID; payment methods and account section (may cause the system to associate payment methods with biller account, and may include a set default button to establish the biller&apos;s default method and account); set default payment method and account; marketing message; legal text; and payer model. The system may provide a load default button to fill in all fields with the default entries. The system may provide a save default button to save the current entries as the default settings. Hitting the save button may cause the system to save the current payer&apos;s options, while hitting the cancel button may cause the system to discard any changes. Selecting the adjustments task may cause the system to direct the biller system administrator to an adjustments section <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight>, where the system may permit the administrator to establish adjustments available to a specific payer and establish an e-mail notification list. The system may provide a checkbox for enabling and disabling disputes. If disputes are enabled, the system may make available for selection in a listbox the adjustments that the biller will allow the payer system users to make. The system, through the adjustments listbox, may enable the actual selection of adjustments available to the payer system users. The system may make all adjustments selected be available as long as the enable disputes checkbox is checked. The system may also provide a checkbox for e-mailing one or more biller system users on adjustments. If this option is selected, the system may enable a mailing list button for sending automatic e-mails. The system may send to designated biller system users an e-mail for each adjustment made with the following exemplary information: &ldquo;the following adjustment was made by payer name on today&apos;s date&rdquo;; payer number; invoice number; adjustment type; adjustment amount; and adjustment reason. If there is no address set up to receive this e-mail, the system may send an e-mail message by default to the biller system administrator. The system may permit a mailing list function <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> may be accessed by the biller system administrator for modifying mailing list settings (which may be stored as global information on the database). The system may provide a close invoice function <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> for directing the biller system administrator to a close invoice section <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight> to establish invoice-closing criteria for each payer. The system may only permit invoices with the status of &ldquo;paid&rdquo;, &ldquo;presented&rdquo;, or &ldquo;viewed&rdquo; to be closed. All other invoice states may indicate payer workflow is in progress, and the system may not permit invoices having such states to be closed. At the payer invoice close page <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight>, the system may display a list-box with all the payers related to the biller, with the system pre-selecting the most recently selected payer in this session by default. If no payer has previously been selected, then the system may not pre-select a payer from the list-box. For the selected payer, the system may present invoice closing criteria. The system may process criteria entered during the next nightly sweep. The system may mark as closed invoices that meet the closing criteria. Selecting the e-mail <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> task may cause the system to direct the biller system administrator to a payer e-mail <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> section for associating a list of biller system users with a specific payer (which associations the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database). At the payer e-mail page <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>, the system may display a list-box with all the payers related to the biller. The system may pre-select the most recently selected payer in this session by default. If no payer has previously been selected, then the system may not pre-select a payer from the list-box. For the selected payer, the system may display a page having a list-box that contains all biller system users currently related to the payer and a list-box that contains all biller system users currently unrelated to the payer. The system may provide two buttons to allow users to be added or removed from the related list. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Payer System Workflow </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary payer system workflow in one embodiment of the system. When a user logs in <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> to the system using the user ID of a payer, the system may display a payer system administration or &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; page <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. The system may display the user&apos;s name at the top in the form of a &ldquo;Welcome &lsquo;Username&rsquo;&rdquo; message, for personalization. The system may display at a payer system administration page key payer statistics and a list of &ldquo;action items&rdquo; with current counts, amounts in local currency and links to the corresponding pages, as well as information about the basic functionality of the main topics. The system may also display at this page information provided by the administrative user regarding how to contact the administrative user. The current counts may include invoices due today, invoices due tomorrow, invoices that will lose a discount today, invoices that will lose a discount tomorrow, invoices past due, invoices outstanding with adjustments, total invoices, verified invoices, initiated payments, authorized payments, and pending payments. The system may provide a selection to the user for filtering and/or sorting the counts. The system may display a biller list, which may include all billers that the payer has a relationship with in the system. The system may permit the payer system user to click on any biller to get a list of invoices from that biller. The system may permit the payer system user to return to this page by clicking on a link that may be present on every page during system access. One area of the screen may contain navigation buttons grouped into categories, e.g., invoices due today <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, invoices due tomorrow <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, invoices that will lose a discount today <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>, invoices that will lose a discount tomorrow <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, invoices past due <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>, outstanding invoices with adjustments <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, total invoices <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight>, and verified invoices <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, all of which may link to an invoice list page <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> to display the desired invoices. Other navigation buttons may include initiated payments <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (which may link to the initiate payment page), authorized payments <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> (which may link to the authorize payment page), pending payments <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> (which may link to the pending payments page), administration <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> (discussed further hereinbelow at &ldquo;Payer System Administration&rdquo;), invoices/payments <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>, reports <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, and biller directory <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight>. The system may expand these categories into subcategories that modify another portion of the screen. One area of the navigation frame may contain the user name (not the user ID) who is logged on. The system may allow the user to click on this link to modify his or her basic profile information. The system may provide other functionality, including a &ldquo;help&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> for directing the user to a help section <highlight><bold>819</bold></highlight> and a &ldquo;logout&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> for logging the current user out of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The system may allow the payer system user to select an option to edit the active user profile, wherein the system may direct the payer system user may be directed to a page displaying the organization name of the payer at the top, to establish the context of the current edit. The system may permit information to be maintained and edited at this page and may store the information as global information on the database, e.g., last name, first, middle, phone, fax, e-mail, e-mail2, password and confirmation. The system may require certain fields for user information, including last name, first name, e-mail and phone. The system may include this information in e-mails which may be sent through the system and may also make this information available to biller and payer system administrators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> If the payer system user selects invoices due today <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, invoices due tomorrow <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, invoices that will lose a discount today <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>, invoices that will lose a discount tomorrow <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, invoices past due <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>, outstanding invoices with adjustments <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, total invoices <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight>, or verified invoices <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, the system may direct the payer system user to an invoice list page <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> for displaying invoices which meet the corresponding chosen parameters. At the invoice list page <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>, the system may display to the payer system user invoices based on selected criteria and/or allow the payer system user to specify general search criteria for listing invoices. Depending on the selection, the system may direct the user to a &ldquo;view options&rdquo; page <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight> for filtering and sorting. At the view options page <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>, the system may allow the user control over the subset of data that will be displayed and the order in which the data will be presented. To further facilitate the presentation of invoices, the system may automatically save settings associated with a specific report (which may be stored as global information on the database) and allow them to be used again the next time the user generates the report. Considering the time it may take to generate certain reports (e.g. lengthy reports), the system may also provide an option to bring this page up before running a report, to limit the scope and time. The view options page may consist of three exemplary areas: extract, sort and options. In the extract area, the system may provide the following exemplary choices: by date (past due, eligible for discount, due within xxx days); and by status (paid invoices, adjusted invoices, unpaid invoices, paid through another source); and by biller (all biller, specific biller); and by attribute range between xxx and yyy (none, invoice numbers, store/location, purchase orders, purchase request number, invoice issue dates, dollar amount, bill of lading numbers, receiving location zipcodes, invoice aging). The system may also provide the ability to search for invoice number, store or location number, routing number and P.O. number by using wildcards. The system may provide a sort area to allow returned results to be sorted in ascending or descending order according to the following exemplary criteria: due date, invoice number, invoice date, purchase order number, net amount due, store or location number, and invoice aging. In one embodiment, the system may determine sorting criteria and order by a sort order combo box, which may default to ascending, and three sort criteria boxes, the first of which may default to due date, while the rest may default to no sort criteria (spaces). The system may provide an options area with the following exemplary choices: define page size (for displaying invoices in a paging method), remember and use previous settings, and show view options page before presentation. The system may be adapted to store extract, sort, and options data as global information on the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The system may allow a payer system user to select an option <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> to list invoices matching specified criteria. The system may display at this screen the filter/sort criteria that are in use for this display. The system may display invoices using a paging concept (i.e. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>). When displaying invoices, the system may remove any existing navigation area, so as to optimize the invoice display area. In one embodiment, the system may display a page separated into two sections, with the header section containing non-scrolling data and/or buttons and the body section that scrolls as necessary, depending upon the width of the browser window and the number of invoices being displayed. The header section may contain the following elements: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The user&apos;s selection criteria, i.e., All Invoices-Past due. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The display range text in the format of first-last of maximum, i.e., <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Next &lsquo;n&rsquo;&rdquo; may cause the system to navigate the user to the next &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices, i.e., &ldquo;Next <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. If the last &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices are currently being displayed the system may disable the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Previous &lsquo;n&rsquo;&rdquo; may cause the system to navigate the user to the previous &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices, i.e., &ldquo;Previous <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&rdquo;. If the first &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices are currently being displayed the system may disable the &ldquo;Previous&rdquo; button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;All&rdquo; may cause the system to change the mode from displaying a page of invoices to displaying all invoices and the system may label the button &ldquo;Page&rdquo;, i.e., <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. If the &ldquo;Page&rdquo; button is selected, the system may display at this page the first &ldquo;n&rdquo; invoices, and the system may label the button &ldquo;All&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Back&rdquo; may cause the system to return to the previous screen, step, or function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Search&rdquo; may cause the system to perform a search in the current invoice list by using the &ldquo;Find&rdquo; feature. The system may permit only the invoices currently being displayed to be searched. The system may allow the user to type a string to search for before selecting the &ldquo;Search&rdquo; button. The system may search each invoice for the specified string. If a match is found, the system may scroll the invoice record into view and select the text found. Selecting &ldquo;Search&rdquo; again may cause the system to find the next instance of the string. The system may permit wildcard searches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Show Selected&rdquo; may cause the system to display all invoices that have been manually checked. In the last column of the invoice list, the system may allow a user to select individual invoices. While the user remains on this page, the system may maintain in a list all invoices that are marked as selected. If the user switches the context of this view, the system may not remove any selection made by the user. Clicking on the &ldquo;Show Selected&rdquo; button may cause the system to display all the invoices the user has selected. The system may change this button may change to either &ldquo;Page&rdquo; or &ldquo;All&rdquo;, depending on the state of the selection when this button was pressed. Selecting this button again may cause the system to return the invoice list to its previous mode. The system may display all Selected invoices, even if they exceed the page limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Paid Through Another Source&rdquo; may be provided by the system as an option for the payer system user to mark an invoice as closed by selecting desired invoices and clicking on the &ldquo;Paid through another source&rdquo; button. Once this occurs, the system may, for the invoices in question, update their audit trail to reflect that they were paid outside the system, and then change their status to &ldquo;Closed&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In the body section, the system may display all invoices in table format. The width of the table columns may be proportional to the width of the browser window. If the browser window is narrowed, the system may decrease column widths appropriately and wrap text within each column, as necessary. If an invoice has adjustments, the system may highlight that line in color to indicate this fact. The system may link the invoice number field to the invoice detail page. The system may link the status field to the invoice history page, at which the system may display a full status history for the selected invoice. By default, the system may display the following exemplary columns: biller name (and/or logo(s)), invoice number, due date, status, net amount due, amount to pay, and select. The payer system administrator may optionally elect to display additional columns (e.g., P.O. number, P.O. requisition number, store number) by setting them in the payer profile (which may be stored as global information on the database). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The system may permit the payer system user to select an option <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight> to display the details of a selected invoice, which may cause the system to direct the user to an invoice detail section <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. The system may use one or more predetermined, customizable and/or selectable template schema to format the payer detail, and the system may provide a single payer multiple templates from which to select. The system may present detail using a selected language associated with the selected payer and/or user (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database). The invoice detail page may contain various sections. One section may display summary information for the selected invoice, information about the payer, information about the particular invoice, and/or information about the biller. The system may provide selectable buttons for obtaining more information about the current invoice, e.g., items <highlight><bold>831</bold></highlight>, messages <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>, e-mail <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>, status <highlight><bold>834</bold></highlight>, shipping info <highlight><bold>835</bold></highlight>, discounts <highlight><bold>836</bold></highlight>, and notes <highlight><bold>837</bold></highlight>. The system may display line items that have been adjusted in a different color. Upon selection by a user of the items button <highlight><bold>831</bold></highlight>, the system may toggle the header view from showing a detailed header description to allowing the user to perform basic search operations on the details of this invoice. The items button <highlight><bold>831</bold></highlight> may cause the system to toggle to header. Clicking on the header button may cause the system to return to the previous view, thereby providing more space for viewing details on the current page, as follows. Another section may contain the line items that make up the invoice. The system may color code highlight line items that have been adjusted. Each line may have a clickable line number. Clicking a line item&apos;s number may cause the system to expand the line to show its detail. Clicking a particular adjustment may cause the system to display a window with details about that specific adjustment. Another section may contain the invoice summary. For both the original amount billed and the amount to pay, the system may calculate and display the following: gross total invoice; time conditional discount; other discount/charge; a general adjustments link (which may allow the general adjustment for the current invoice to be entered or edited); sales tax; other tax; and net amount due. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The system may, upon selection of the messages button <highlight><bold>832</bold></highlight>, display a new browser window <highlight><bold>842</bold></highlight> displaying any messages defined by the biller system administrator for this payer.

The system may provide a search function for performing a search in the current invoice list. The system may permit only the invoices currently being displayed to be searched. The system may allow the user to type a string to search for before selecting the &ldquo;Search&rdquo; button. The system may search each invoice may for the specified string. If a match is found, the system may scroll the invoice record into view and select the text found. Selecting &ldquo;Search&rdquo; again may cause the system to find the next instance of the string. The system may permit wildcard searches. The system may provide clickable line numbers in the items view line, whereby upon clicking a line item&apos;s number, the system may expand the line to show its invoices, and clicking a particular adjustment may cause the system to bring up a window with details about that specific adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The system may provide other selectable options, including a website button for opening a separate browser window containing links to biller-specific websites, and a biller info button for displaying a new browser window containing the biller information supplied for the current payer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> From the perspective of the payer system user, the system may identify an invoice as having one of the following exemplary states: presented, viewed (an invoice may be considered &ldquo;viewed&rdquo; when a invoice display query is built with the invoice included; the user does not necessarily need to actually see the invoice to have it considered viewed), verified (an invoice that is in this state may be rolled back to viewed given the user has the permission to verify), payment initiated, payment authorized, payment pending (an invoice in this state may be rolled back to verified given the user has the permission to authorize payment), paid, and closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in the payer invoice/payments workflow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, if the payer system user selects invoice/payments <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>, the system may direct him or her to further select from among invoice/payment selections, which may include, e.g., review invoice <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>, initiate payment <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, approve/verify invoice <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, authorize payment <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, pending payment <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>, payment history <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, and file export <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The invoice list <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, status <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>, detail <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and sorting <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> pages may be functionally identical to those described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at ciphers <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>851</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Selecting the approve/verify invoices <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> function may cause the system to direct the user to an approve/verify page <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> containing an invoice list, with appropriate links to invoice status <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>, detail <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and sorting <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> pages. The invoice list, status <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>, detail <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and sorting <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> pages may be functionally identical to those described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at ciphers <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>851</bold></highlight>. Via the invoice list shown, the system may permit the payer system user to view all invoices in the system that have not yet been approved for payment, subject to the criteria set in the view options page. The system may provide appropriate functionality to approve an individual invoice, approve a selection of invoices, or approve all invoices in the current extract. For any invoice in the extracted set, the system may permit the user to view the corresponding invoice detail page <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight> or the invoice status page <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>. Invoices included on this page may indicate one of the following exemplary states: presented, viewed, or adjusted. The system may provide appropriate functionality to confirm approval of an individual invoice or group of invoices. The system may permit further selection of an &ldquo;approve invoices&rdquo; or &ldquo;verify confirm&rdquo; <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> page to permit the user to confirm the requested action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Selecting the initiate payment <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> function may cause the system to direct the user to an initiate payment page <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> containing an invoice list, with appropriate links to invoice status <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>, detail <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and sorting <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> pages.

Via the invoice list shown, the system may permit the payer system user to view all invoices in the system that have been approved for payment, subject to the criteria set in the view options page. The system ma provide appropriate functionality to initiate payment for an individual invoice, a selection of invoices, or all invoices in the current extract. For any invoice in the extracted set, the system may also permit the user to view the corresponding invoice detail page <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight> or the invoice status page <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>. The system may display an &ldquo;amount to pay&rdquo; column, the amount shown being net of all applied credits and adjustments. The system may provide appropriate functionality to perform a cancel, which action may cause the system to roll back the status to viewed, detaching any applied credits if necessary. The system may permit the user to toggle between the discount date and the invoice due date. The system may set payment options to the default value established for the current biller/payer relationship. The system may page payments to accurately represent how the payment will be submitted. If the selection contains applied credit notes, the system may render each in a separate payment. The system may further permit the user to select a payment initiation selection page <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> to confirm the requested action, i.e. to confirm payment initiation of selected invoices in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Selecting the authorize payment function <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> may cause the system to direct the user to an authorization page <highlight><bold>917</bold></highlight> containing an invoice list, with appropriate links to invoice status <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, detail <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and sorting <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> pages. The invoice list, status <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, detail <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and sorting <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> pages may be functionally identical to those described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at ciphers <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>851</bold></highlight>. Via the invoice list shown, the system may permit the payer system user to view all invoices in the system that have had payment initiated, subject to the criteria set in the view options page. The system may permit the user to click on any check number to view details for that payment group. The system may further permit the payer system user to select check boxes next to payments to select those payments, and to click on an &ldquo;authorize&rdquo; button to authorize those selected payments. The system may further permit the user to click on an &ldquo;authorize all&rdquo; button to authorize all payments listed. The payment method may be the payment option selected for this transaction, and the initiator may be the user name of the user who authorized the payment. The system may permit the authorize stage to be automatically bypassed if the payment amount is less than a pre-selected threshold amount. The system may further permit the user to select an authorize payment confirmation page <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> to confirm the requested action, i.e. to confirm payment authorization of selected invoices in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Selecting the pending payments <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> function may cause the system to direct the user to a pending payment page <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> containing an invoice list, with appropriate links to invoice status <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, detail <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and sorting <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> pages. The invoice list, status <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, detail <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, and sorting <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> pages may be functionally identical to those described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at ciphers <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>851</bold></highlight>. Via the invoice list shown, the system may permit the payer system user to view all pending payments in the system subject to the criteria set in the view options page. The system may permit the user to click on any check number to view details for that payment group. The system may further permit the payer system user to select check boxes next to payments to select those payments, and to click on a &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; button to cancel the selected payments. The system may further permit the user to click on &ldquo;cancel all payments&rdquo; to cancel all payments listed. Canceling a pending payment may cause the system to roll the transaction back to the &ldquo;verified&rdquo; invoice state. The system may further permit the user to select a cancellation confirmation page <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> to confirm the requested action, i.e. to confirm canceling pending payments for selected invoices in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Selecting the payment history <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> function may cause the system to direct the user to a payment history page <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, wherein the user may view all paid invoices in the system, referencing the corresponding check number, subject to the criteria set in the view options page. The system may provide an invoice history page <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, whereby the system may display an invoice history line for each invoice that meets the view options criteria. Selecting an invoice number link may cause the system to display the corresponding invoice detail page (e.g., as shown and described with respect to cipher <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The system may provide an invoice status link for displaying a corresponding invoice status page (e.g. as shown and described with respect to cipher <highlight><bold>844</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The system may permit the payer system user to select an export files function <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>, i.e., to download data directly from the server, bypassing the need to have the data flow through a transmission to the payer system user. Selecting the export files option <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight> may cause the system to direct the user to the invoice export section <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>, from which the user may either edit export templates or export files. Upon selection of edit export templates, the system may allow the payer system user to edit the templates used in file export. An export templates listbox may shows the present export templates while a template settings area may contain all the attributes and settings of the current selected template. Upon selection of a template from the export templates listbox, the system may populate the fields of the template settings area. In this area, the system may allow the payer system user to add, modify, or delete file export templates (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database) by using a set of buttons or controls. The set of invoices to be exported may be based on the invoices that are being viewed at the time export is chosen. The system may permit the user to set that filter through the filter/sort page. The template settings area may contain the following exemplary controls (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database): document type, document status, include (headers and/or line items), fields and export order (may contain a listbox of the available invoice fields and an ordered listbox of fields marked for export with two buttons for moving fields between listboxes; up and down buttons may allow the field export order to be changed), file formats (a listbox that allows the file format to be selected; if ASCII is chosen, the system may display a delimiter section and require the user to select field and record delimiters; file formats may include X12 810, &ldquo;XML 810&rdquo;, PayBase&trade;, and CSV). The system may provide a &ldquo;set default&rdquo; button for allowing the user to set the current template as the default template for the file export page. Upon selecting file export, the system may allow the payer system user to export invoices based on an export template. N the templates listbox, the system may show the present export templates while the export range may allow the user to select the date range criteria for including invoices in the export. The system may provide a &ldquo;today&rdquo; checkbox, for aiding in setting the to bounding date to the current date. An &ldquo;export&rdquo; button may cause the system to perform the file export, while a &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; button may cause the system to abort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the system may further permit a payer system user not only to view adjusted invoices from the invoice detail screen (e.g. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 823</cross-reference>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and described above), but also to make adjustments to an invoice. In this scenario, from a user interface perspective, the system may allow the original amount to remain, but may change the &ldquo;amount to pay&rdquo; to &ldquo;amount to adjust&rdquo;. At the bottom of the invoice, the system may add a new line that reflects the unapproved amount to pay, subject to any required approval. The system may also allow credit and debit notes to be entered by a payer system user, whereby credit notes may be entered by a user and/or handled by the system as invoices with a negative dollar amount, and debit notes entered by a user and/or handled by the system as invoices. Thus, the system may permit credit requests to be entered in the same manner as adjustments are entered. If a credit request is issued, the system may send an e-mail to the distribution list for this event, referencing the invoice in question (i.e. invoice number, date, paying company, etc.), amount of credit requested, type of adjustment, adjustment code, and description of need for credit. After an invoice load, the system may execute a process that sets negative dollar invoices to a &ldquo;verified&rdquo; status, so that they will appear on the &ldquo;initiate payment&rdquo; list. The system may not roll back invoices with a &ldquo;verified&rdquo; status and a negative dollar amount to &ldquo;presented&rdquo; or &ldquo;viewed&rdquo; status. The system may make a report available to certain users listing all outstanding credit notes, including quantity and total dollar amount. As shown in the workflow diagrams of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</cross-reference>, the system may permit the payer system user to select a reports option <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, which may cause the system to display subcategories that correspond to the available reports for selection. Exemplary reports may include: cashflow forecasting <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, payment history <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, security administrator statistics <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>, payer profile <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, invoice summary <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>, discount <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, returned items <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight>, outstanding invoice statistics <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>, and modified invoice summary <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight>. The system may permit the user to select from among various reporting options and/or filters <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database), and the system may then generate a report for viewing and/or printing at a report page <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As shown in the workflow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the system may permit a payer system user to select a biller directory option for displaying a screen containing options which, when selected, cause the system to direct the user to pages for viewing biller websites and/or e-mail addresses <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> and a biller directory <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight> (i.e. a list of available billers in the system). From the biller directory <highlight><bold>861</bold></highlight>, clicking on a biller&apos;s company name may cause the system to bring the user to a URL set by the biller system administrator. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Payer System Administration Workflow </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary payer system administration workflow in one embodiment of the system. From the administration <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> screen, the system may permit a payer system administrator to select from among functions including, e.g., edit payer profile <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, edit banks <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, edit users <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, edit event e-mails <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, edit biller agreement <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>, and password change <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Upon selection by the payer system administrator of the edit payer profile <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> function, the system may redirect the payer system administrator to a payer profile section <highlight><bold>1107</bold></highlight> for editing the payer&apos;s profile information. The system may permit company data to be entered and/or edited for the following exemplary fields (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database): name, address, city, state, zip, country, SIC code, TIN, organization type, show invoice list columns, language for local country presentation, and currency for payment. The system may provide additional functionality for displaying an &ldquo;instant payment&rdquo; interface and a default settlement dates selector. At the instant payment interface, the system may permit the administrator to edit the company&apos;s instant payment terms that are used for payment of invoices in the system. The system may allow a payer system administrator to establish a threshold payment amount for instant payment. If an invoice comes in with a value less than the threshold amount, the system may be adapted to immediately initiate and authorize the invoice. When the <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> is loaded, if an invoice is below the threshold amount, the system may immediately create a payment, place it in the pending queue, and initiate an audit trail. Instant payment data (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database) may include the following exemplary fields: Instant payment (enabled/disabled), threshold amount, default account, default method of payment, and default settlement date (due date or discount date). The default settlement date may cause the system to provide additional functionality for the payer of having the settlement date by default be the due date to receive discounts. The system may provide the user the ability to change that date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Upon selection by the payer system administrator of the edit banks <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> function, the system may redirect the payer system administrator to a payer bank editing section <highlight><bold>1109</bold></highlight> for allowing the bank information associated with the payer to be edited. It is contemplated that a payer may have multiple banks with each bank having multiple bank accounts. An exemplary edit banks <highlight><bold>1109</bold></highlight> section may be separated into three sections. In the first section, the system may display a list-box containing all the banks associated with the current payer. Selecting a bank from this list may cause the system to set the context for all other sections and fields of the page. For the selected bank, the system may display in a second section the following exemplary fields (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database): name, address, city, state, zip code, country, country&num;, account &num; and RTN. The system may use a MOD9 or similar algorithm to verify valid routing numbers. The system may provide a delete button, which may cause the system to display a confirmation message before deleting the selected bank. Selecting a modify button may cause the system to update the existing bank information with the modified data. Selecting an add button may cause the system to add the current bank information as a new bank. The system may require that the bank name and account &num; be unique. Pressing a &ldquo;set default&rdquo; button may cause the system to set the current bank as the default bank for making payments. In a third section, the system may display for the selected bank a &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; list-box populated with all bank holidays associated with this bank. Selecting an existing bank holiday from this list box, followed by the selection of a &ldquo;delete&rdquo; button, may cause the system to delete the selected bank holiday. The system may provide combo-boxes for month, day and year selection. Selecting an add button may cause the system to add the selected date to the holiday list-box. If a bank is added with, or is caused to have no holidays through later modification, the system may display a warning to the user. The system may be adapted to store holiday data as global information on the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The system may permit a payer system administrator to select a &ldquo;users&rdquo; <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> function, wherein the system may direct the administrator to an edit user section <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>. In this section, the system may permit the administrator to add, modify or delete users associated with the current payer. At this page, the system may display the name of the payer at the top to establish the context of the edit. The system may populate a list box with the selected payer system&apos;s user names. As the administrator clicks on each user, the system may display the user&apos;s information in a user information section. The system may permit the administrator to add a new user to the current payer by entering information into the user information section. The system may require that the combination of last name, middle initial and first name be unique. The system may permit modify and delete operations to be performed on the currently selected user. The system may provide a checkbox for temporarily deactivating a user. Contact information (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database) may be maintained, including, e.g., last name, first, middle, phone, fax, e-mail, e-mail2, user ID, password and confirmation. The system may require certain fields for user information, such as last name, first name, e-mail and phone. The system may provide a reset password button for resetting the selected user&apos;s password to the default setting. The system may automatically send an e-mail to a new user after they have been added, telling the user that they have 24 hours to log in and change their password or the account will be disabled (e.g. where the password is set to the default of user&apos;s last name; the system may permit accounts to be re-enabled by a payer system administrator). The e-mail may also tell the user how to connect and logon to the system. The system may provide an &ldquo;assigned billers&rdquo; button for accessing the edit assigned billers page <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight>, where the administrator may assign billers to the current user. At this page, the system may display the name of the payer and user at the top to establish the context of the edit. At this page, the system may display a list-box that contains all billers currently assigned to the current user and a list-box that contains all billers currently not assigned to the current user. The system may provide two buttons to allow billers to be added or removed from the assigned list. The system may provide a &ldquo;permissions&rdquo; button for permitting access to the permissions page <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, wherein the system may permit a user&apos;s permission scope to be narrowed to an organizational subset of the assigned biller. At this page, the system may allow the administrator to modify permissions associated with the current user. At this page, the system may display the name of the biller and user at the top to establish the context of the edit. At this page, the system may display a list of permissions available to the currently selected user. The system may determine the permissions available by the permissions available to the current administrator. Permissions (which the system may be adapted to store as global information on the database) may be inherited. The system may display in a list of permissions the organizational defined nodes. A single node may be assigned to the user. By default, a user may have full permissions. The system may permit the desired permission set to be selected for the user and then saved with a &ldquo;save&rdquo; button. The system may provide a &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; button for exiting and discarding all changes. The system may provide a number of pre-defined payer privilege profiles to simplify the security model. The system may permit the administrator user to choose one of these to give a new user a particular set of permissions. From there, the system may allow permissions for that user to be altered. Exemplary pre-defined payer privilege profiles (which may be stored as global information on the database) may include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Security Administrator: May have all payer profile and administration permissions, including the ability to set-up and delete ID&apos;s, bank accounts and the payer profile itself. The system may not allow this ID to be connected to any billers or any processing permissions. The system may permit this ID access to the security administration report only. The system may permit this ID only to be set-up by the system SuperUser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Receiving Supervisor: May be provided with a button called &ldquo;adjust an invoice&rdquo;. With this new button, the system may permit a receiving administrator to be able to review an invoice and make changes. However, the system may restrict change permissions to quantity adjustments only. The system may link or map this type of ID to an individual biller or group of billers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Purchasing Manager: May be provided with the buttons for list all invoices; approve invoices (keeping all adjustment capabilities intact); pending payments without the cancel payment privilege; invoice history and biller directories. The system may permit all these permissions to be filtered by biller if the ID were assigned to a particular biller or subset of billers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Payables Administrator: May have permissions for initiate payments, with one new feature, the ability to create a general invoice adjustment only prior to creating a payment order; pending payments without the cancel payment privilege and payment history. The system may permit all these buttons to be filtered by bank account and biller if the ID were assigned to a particular subset of bank accounts and/or billers. The system may assign this ID the following reports: return items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Payables Manager: May have permissions for authorize payments; pending payments with cancel payment permissions; payment history; invoice history; payer profile and biller directories. The system may allow this role to be filtered using dollar amount and may assign this ID the following reports: return items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Controller: May have permissions for list all invoices; pending payments without cancel payment permissions; payment history; and invoice history. The system may assign this ID the following reports: cashflow forecasting; outstanding invoices; discount management; adjusted invoice history and security administrator </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Cash Manager: May have permissions for pending payments without cancel payment permissions. The system may assign this ID the following reports: cashflow forecasting report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Payables Systems Administrator: May be responsible for managing the daily file export routine for both unpaid invoices and payments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Upon selection by the payer system administrator of the event e-mails <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> function, the system may redirect the payer system administrator to an event e-mail section <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight>. In this section, the system may permit a list of payer system users to be associated with specific system events. Any time one of these specific events occurs, the system may generate an automatic e-mail and send it to the selected list of payer system users. For example, exemplary distribution list choices may include: invoices loaded successfully, invoices approved, payment initiated, payment authorized, payment canceled, and payment completed. The system may display at the this page a list-box that contains all payer system users currently in the selected distribution list and a list-box that contains all payer system users currently not in the selected distribution list. In one embodiment, the system may provide two buttons to allow users to be added or removed from the distribution list. The system may allow a default e-mail address to be set up for each event, e.g. the payer system administrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Selecting edit biller agreement <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> may cause the system to direct the payer system administrator to an edit biller agreement page <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>, from which the payer system administrator may access such exemplary pages as biller organization <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight>, options <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>, and biller e-mail <highlight><bold>1117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The system may provide a biller organization page <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight> to address the enterprise organizational model, the goal being to simulate the business structure of an enterprise so that the proper people can have access to and see the appropriate information. Although business organizations are hierarchical by definition, this structure may be too complex for the intended system implementation. Moreover, much of what makes up an organizational hierarchy is not passed as an attribute of an invoice transaction. Instead, what may be implemented supports the specificity of the hierarchical organization, while at the same time assuming no structure. For example, a biller organization might consist of company, department, region, division or store units. Assuming that these fields are populated within the invoice transactions of the system, the system may permit permission sets to be defined, each permission set being for assigning and establishing data access rights to specific users. Each permission set may contain one or more uniquely defined combinations. Three exemplary permission sets might be: Set &num;1 (Store &num;1, Store &num;2, Store &num;3); Set &num;2 (Store &num;4, Store &num;5, Store &num;6); and Set &num;3 (Division &num;1, Division &num;2). At the biller&apos;s organization page, the system may display a list-box containing all the billers related to the current payer. The system may pre-select by default the most recently selected biller in this session. If no biller has previously been selected, then the system may not pre-select any biller from the list-box. For the selected biller, the system may display the list of defined organizational elements or permission sets. The system may provide buttons to add, remove and modify an entry, and may further provide an edit control to allow editing of the name of the entry. The system may display a second list-box containing the specific data values that make up the organizational element for the selected biller. A data value may be made up of the field identifier and the field value. The system may provide a combo-box that allows the user to select the field identifier, and the system may provide an edit control to allow the user to enter the field value. The system may provide buttons to add, remove and modify an entry from this list. The system may be adapted to store biller organization data as global information on the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Selecting the options function may cause the system to allow the payer system administrator to establish options for a specific biller using a biller options page <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>. At the biller options page, the system may display a list-box containing all the billers related to the payer. The system may pre-select by default the most recently selected biller in this session. If no biller has previously been selected, the system may not pre-select any biller from the list-box. For the selected biller, the system may display the biller options. Exemplary biller options may include: payment methods and account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Selecting the biller e-mail function may cause the system to allow the payer system administrator to associate a list of payer system users with a specific biller using a biller e-mail page <highlight><bold>1117</bold></highlight>. At the biller e-mail page, the system may display a list-box with all the billers related to the payer. The system may pre-select the most recently selected biller in this session by default. If no biller has previously been selected, the system may not pre-select any biller from the list-box. For the selected biller, the system may display at this page a list-box that contains all payer system users currently related to the biller and a list-box that contains all payer system users currently unrelated to the biller. The system may provide two buttons to allow users to be added or removed from the related list. The system may be adapted to store the foregoing associations as global information on the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The system may provide a password change button <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, for directing the payer system administrator to a password change section <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> for changing password information. </paragraph>

These computer systems may be geographically distributed and connected together via appropriate wide- and local-area network hardware and software. In one embodiment, program data may be made accessible to the user via standard SQL queries for analysis and reporting purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Primary elements of the invention may be server-based and may reside on hardware supporting an operating system such as Microsoft Windows NT/2000&trade; or UNIX. Clients may include a PC that supports Apple Macintosh &trade;, Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000&trade;, a UNIX Motif workstation platform, or other computer capable of TCP/IP or other network-based interaction. In one embodiment, no software other than a web browser may be required on the client platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the aforesaid functional components may be embodied by a plurality of separate computer processes (e.g. generated via dBase&trade;, Xbase&trade;, MS Access&trade; or other &ldquo;flat file&rdquo; type database management systems or products) running on IBM-type, Intel Pentium&trade; or RISC microprocessor-based personal computers networked together via conventional networking hardware and software and including such other additional conventional hardware and software as may be necessary to permit these functional components to achieve the stated functionalities. In this alternative configuration, since such personal computers typically may be unable to run full-scale relational database engines of the types presented above, a non-relational flat file &ldquo;table&rdquo; (not shown) may be included in at least one of the networked personal computers to represent at least portions of data stored by a system according to the present invention. These personal computers may run the Unix, Microsoft Windows NT/2000&trade; or Windows 95/98/ME&trade; operating systems. The aforesaid functional components of a system according to the present invention may also comprise a combination of the above two configurations (e.g. by computer program processes running on a combination of personal computers, RISC systems, mainframes, symmetric or parallel computer systems, and/or other appropriate hardware and software, networked together via appropriate wide- and local-area network hardware and software). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> A system according to the present invention may also be part of a larger computerized financial transaction system comprising multi-database or multi-computer systems or &ldquo;warehouses&rdquo; wherein other data types, processing systems (e.g. transaction, financial, administrative, statistical, data extracting and auditing, data transmission/reception, and/or accounting support and service systems), and/or storage methodologies may be used in conjunction with those of the present invention to achieve an overall information management, processing, storage, search, statistical and retrieval solution for a particular lock box service provider, e-payment warehouser, biller organization, financial institution, payment system, commercial bank, and/or for a cooperative or network of such systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, source code may be written in an object-oriented programming language using relational databases. Such an embodiment may include the use of programming languages such as C&plus;&plus;. Other programming languages which may be used in constructing a system according to the present invention include Java, HTML, Perl, UNIX shell scripting, assembly language, Fortran, Pascal, Visual Basic, and QuickBasic. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The translation or mapping of EDI-type financial data, particularly of the X12, UN/EDIFACT, and NACHA formats, as discussed herein, is provided herein only as an example of transaction data capable of interacting with the invention and should not be construed so as to limit the use of the invention solely in such a setting. While the discussion herein presumes the use of the invention with respect to EDI, transactional, or financial data, it is anticipated that the invention may have utility in other contexts, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Payment options such as ACH debits, credit or procurement card payments, and/or paper checks may be provided. For ACH debits, a 24 hour settlement window may be required, in which case the payment must be sent to the receiving financial institution 24 hours prior to the settlement date specified by the payer system user. If an ACH debit fails, an ACH return file may be sent from the financial institution, in which case the file is loaded and each transaction may be matched against invoices with the status of paid. When there is a match, the invoice in question may be reopened and rolled back to the status of &ldquo;verified&rdquo;. Paper checks may be generated internally or by an external software module, wherein an output file in a format capable of being read by the external module may be generated. Payment by a payer system user using a credit or procurement card may also be effected, to be processed by internet or other means. In this scenario, additional security levels may be included, e.g., for initiating credit card payments (along with a dollar amount limit) and approving credit card payments, and such appropriate credit card payment processing functionality as may be appropriate may be included, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> It should also be appreciated from the outset that one or more of the functional components may alternatively be constructed out of custom, dedicated electronic hardware and/or software, without departing from the present invention. Thus, the present invention is intended to cover all such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and broad scope of the invention as defined only by the hereinafter appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> It should be recognized by those skilled in the art that the present invention may have utility in contexts other than invoice payment, and that the parties to transactions handled by the invention may be entities other than payers and billers/payees in a vendor/vendee context. For example, the invention may be used in bank-to-bank transactions, bank-to-consumer transactions, consumer-to-consumer transactions, and any other financial transactional setting. </paragraph>
