<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method of automating the procedure of a plurality of task operations, more particularly to a method of relating specific information systems that have been constructed to aid in carrying out respective tasks by relating data shared among the information systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, in the midst of structural innovation of public agencies, performance evaluation systems are being revamped to improve public services. For example, instead of a conventional promotion and advancement system based on the length of service and the school of a staff member, an ability evaluation system of combining sure rewards with punishments that evaluates performance based on a provision rating of services to the users of the public services and a user-satisfaction rating is likely to be introduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, when this kind of ability evaluation system is introduced, there is a fear that various problems might arise. For example, there will be a problem that, unless there is a good reason for the ability evaluation of a staff member, the aspiration of the staff member will fall rather than rise, which can lead to poor public services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A conventional performance evaluation system, in which a performance goal is set on a voluntary basis by a staff member or a sector and an evaluator defines an achievement rate and calculates an ability evaluation coefficient, has a drawback in that it is difficult to determine the appropriateness of the performance evaluation goal, especially the extent to which policies will contribute to improved public services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition, even if the achievement rate of a performance goal is defined, there is a problem that it is difficult to determine quantitatively and objectively the extent to which the performance goal has been achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as a widespread of the Internet has come to further networking of computers of companies and public agencies, electronic public services are being given attention. Electronic public services electronically gather requests and opinions from customers of companies and users of public agencies and makes information of the companies and the public agencies available to the customers and the users. In particular, the proliferation of electronic public services makes it easier for the users to access the public agencies, increasing the opportunities of exchanging various kinds of information between scores of users and the public agencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, there is a fear that such an increase in the opportunities of exchanging information on such electronic public services might pose a lot of problems. For example, if public agencies adopt requests and opinions of the users and make information about their policies available to the users electronically, there will be a problem that it becomes difficult to determine to what policy and how the requests and opinions of the users have been reflected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With a conventional electronic public service system, although requests and opinions are adopted from users of public agencies, it has been difficult to see the extent to which the requests and opinions have been reflected to the policies. There is another problem that, if there is a rise in public opinion, public agencies have taken steps by making inquiries for putting it to a vote, but if not, the relationship between requests and opinions and policies has been left unseen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> If such problems as mentioned above are encountered, it would be necessary for public agencies to determine quantitatively and objectively the appropriateness of performance evaluation goals of staff members and, in particular, their policies and verify the relationship between the requests and opinions of the users and the policies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> With a conventional performance evaluation system, it has been required to separately adopt a user&apos;s opinion on a performance evaluation goal proposed by a staff member or a sector, especially on policies. With conventional electronic public service systems, it has also been required to check requests and opinions from users against policies and make their relationships clear. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This embodiment will be described with the use of an example for relating two information systems shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this embodiment takes an entry system for an opinion, an entry system for a personnel goal, or an entry system for a policy evaluation as an example of the first information system, and a performance evaluation system as an example of the second information system, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Therefore, another embodiment may take a form having a plurality of first information systems connected to the second information system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The entry system for an opinion means a system that is used by users of public agencies to output and transmit request data and opinion data regarding the policies of the public agencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The entry system for a personnel goal means a system that is used by staff members of public agencies to output and transmit performance evaluation goal data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The entry system for a policy evaluation means a system that is used by users of public agencies to output and transmit policy evaluation data regarding the policies of the public agencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The performance evaluation system means a system having databases for request data, opinion data, request number data, request point data, policy data, policy evaluation data, policy achievement rate data and performance evaluation data, which accepts requests and opinions from users of public agencies while accepting performance goals from staff members of the public agencies, checking for the difficulty or ease with which the requests from the users can be responded, accepting evaluations for the policies from users, and reflecting the achievement rate of the goal for each staff member to the performance evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> These two information systems are related as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and perform processing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The data input program in the performance evaluation system stores request data and opinion data that have been output and transmitted from the entry system for an opinion in the request database and the opinion database, respectively (Step <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Next, the data relation information generator in the performance evaluation system compares the contents of the request data and the opinion data (e.g. approval and disapproval), generates the resultant data of the comparison as corresponding point data (e.g. request point data), and stores it in a corresponding point database (e.g. a request point database) (Step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Then, the data input program in the evaluation system stores personnel goal data that has been output and transmitted from the entry system for a personnel goal in the personnel goal database (Step <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The data relation information generator compares the request point data to the personnel goal data for a match in the contents (e.g. the contents of Request Name and Goal), generates the resultant data of the comparison as corresponding point data (e.g. goal point data),and stores it in a corresponding point database (e.g. a goal point database) (Step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The data input program in the performance evaluation system stores policy evaluation data that has been output and transmitted from the entry system of a policy evaluation in the policy evaluation database (Step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The data relation information generator in the performance evaluation system compares the contents of the policy evaluation data (e.g. the contents of Ratio of the Execution) with each other, generates the resultant data of the comparison as corresponding point data (e.g. policy evaluation point data) and stores it in a corresponding point database (e.g. a policy evaluation point database) (Step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The data relation information generator in the performance evaluation system compares goal points to policy evaluation points in the respective point data, generates the resultant data of the comparison as performance evaluation point data, and stores it in the performance evaluation point database (Step <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The specific procedural steps for this embodiment will be described on the basis of the example of the procedural steps for relating information systems shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a procedure by which data that has been output from the first information system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is transmitted to the second information system and is stored by the data input program in the storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the data input program of the performance evaluation system stores request data and opinion data that have been output and transmitted from the entry system for an opinion in the request database and the opinion database, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Request data comprises the contents of User Name, Policy Name, and Request Name (e.g. User a, S library project, extension work). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Opinion data comprises the contents of User Name, Policy Name, Request Name, and Opinion (e.g. User b, S library project, extension work, approval). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a procedure by which the data relation information generator of the second information system references data from the storage device and generates data regarding the relationship between the referenced data, and the data input program stores the generated data in the storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> With the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the data relation information generator of the performance evaluation system references request data and opinion data from the request database and the opinion database in the storage device and generates data regarding the relationship between the referenced request data and point data as request point data, and the data input program stores the generated request point data in the request point database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A method of generating request point data will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>: Request data is referenced from the request database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>: Opinion data is referenced from the opinion database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>: The request data and the opinion data are compared for a match in the contents of Policy Name and Request Name. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>: For data having a match in the contents of Policy Name and Request Name, the value of &ldquo;the number of approval minus the number of disapproval&rdquo; is set as a request point. For request data, the number of the matches in the contents of Policy Name and Request Name is counted as the number of approval for the policy and request concerned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>: The request point is stored in the request point database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For example, if Policy Name is S library project and Request Name is extension work, opinions of User a, User b, and User c are all approval, so the number of approval is &ldquo;3&rdquo;, and opinion of User d is disapproval, so the number of disapproval is &ldquo;1&rdquo;.
