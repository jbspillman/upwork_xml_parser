<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A portable document holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is described below and illustrated in the drawings. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the portable document holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is collapsible into a flattened, compact configuration <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the exemplary embodiment, the holder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a back support member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or back support, and a clip member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also referred to herein as &ldquo;clip&rdquo; or &ldquo;holding clip&rdquo; integral with the back support member. The back support member is coupled to the base. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> front end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the back support is coupled to a front end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the base. It should be noted that the terms &ldquo;front,&rdquo; &ldquo;rear,&rdquo; &ldquo;back,&rdquo; &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; &ldquo;rearward,&rdquo; &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;lower&rdquo; are used herein for descriptive purposes to describe relative positions and not exact positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the entire holder is made from polypropylene. Alternatively, the entire holder can be made from other plastic materials or metallic materials, such as aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the back support is coupled to the base via an integral hinge. In other words, one or more thin hinge pieces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extends between the front end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the base and the front end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the back support (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The back support <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and hinge pieces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are all integral. The thin pieces of material forming the hinge pieces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are foldable or bendable, allowing the back support to pivot relative to the base. In an alternate embodiment, other types of hinges, as for example non-integral hinges, may be used to couple the front end of the back support to the front end of the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the back support comprises two leg portions or legs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extending transversely from a front end member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the back support to a rear end member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the two legs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are integrally formed with the front end member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and also integrally formed with the rear end member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the back support. The two legs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and rear end member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> define a generally inverted U-shape. The front end member, rear end member, and the two legs define a central opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The holding clip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a flexible member extending transversely from the front end member <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between the two legs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The holding clip has an upper surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> opposite a lower surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The holding clip lower surface intercepts a plane tangent to the upper surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of both legs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, the holding clip lower surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is a convex surface. The holding clip&apos;s flexibility may be enhanced by removing a portion <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the material forming the holding clip proximate the front member defining two opposite legs <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extending to the front member, as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the base portion has an internal well <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> defined by a floor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a surrounding sidewall <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The well <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> accommodates the back support when in the closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The size of the back support is such that it fits within the well defined in the base when the back support is collapsed relative to the base. To maintain the back support in an extended position relative to the base, two support members <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are used as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. However, instead of two, only one support member may be incorporated. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the support members are cut out from a portion of the well floor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> defining complementary support member openings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, respectively. In the exemplary embodiment, the openings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are defined by peripheral edges <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, but they do not penetrate the entire thickness of the well floor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, thereby defining corresponding depressions for storing the corresponding support members. Alternatively, the support member well openings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may penetrate the entire thickness of the well floor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. With this alternative configuration for the openings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the edges <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the would preferably be tapered toward each other in a direction away from the back support. The tapered edges reduce the size of the opening to prevent the support members from being pushed through their corresponding openings when being stored in the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each of the support members <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> comprises a main body portion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> from which extends a neck portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that terminates in a head <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The heads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of each of the support members &ldquo;snaps&rdquo; into a corresponding slot <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> defined in a lower surface of each leg <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the back support. In the exemplary embodiment, each of these slots <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, is formed by four protrusions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that are spaced apart, forming a quad that allows the neck portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to fit between two of the protrusions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the head <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to fit within all four of the protrusions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the width <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of each support member well opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, decreases in a direction opposite of the front end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the base, i.e., in a rearward direction. To maintain the back support in an extended position, the head and neck portions of the support members <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; into place in their corresponding slots <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> formed on the back support. The opposite end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of each support member <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is fitted within the widest portion of its corresponding support member well opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Because the support member well openings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> decrease in width in a rearward direction, the ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> cannot slide rearwardly relative to their corresponding opening. In turn, the support members <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are able to maintain the back support in an extended, generally upright position. In an alternate embodiment, the ends <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the support members <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be pivotally coupled to the base, as for example by an integral hinge <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> shown in dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, or another type of hinge such as a pin (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A through slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is defined on the front end of the holder. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is defined through the front ends of the back support and base. In other words, an upper portion of the slot is defined on the back support and a lower portion of the slot is defined on the base. The slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is designed to accommodate a securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) for anchoring the holder on to object <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, such as a mouse pad, a desk blotter, a stack of papers, a note pad, or any other object, as for example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with an upper plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a lower plate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> integrally coupled to the upper plate via an end portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. A channel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is defined by the plates <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the end portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be formed with a cut-out <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> across one of its plates to provide access to the other plate so that a user may spread the plates apart for grasping on object between the plates so as to secure the clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the object. More cutouts <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> may be included for providing access from one plate to the other. The securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is fitted through the slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> from the front end of the holder by pushing the end portion of the securing clip into the slot. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, two protrusions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> extend from opposite sides of the securing clip proximately the securing clip end portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 8</cross-reference>, the slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a pair of opposed sides <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, each of which includes a groove <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (one of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to receive the protrusions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. By forming the securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> from a resilient material, as for example, polypropylene, the protrusions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> have a degree of flexibility. In this regard, as the securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is pushed through the slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the protrusions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> compress. When the protrusions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> reach their corresponding grooves <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the protrusions expand into the grooves <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, maintaining the securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> engaged to the slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> fits in a complementary securing clip opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> formed on the base well floor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The clip opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may only penetrate a portion of the well floor thickness defining a depression for storing the securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, or the opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may penetrate the entire thickness of the well floor. If it penetrates the entire thickness, the edges <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the opening may be tapered so as to reduce the area of the opening in a direction away from the back support so as to provide support for the securing clip when stored in the securing clip opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the back support collapses onto the base, it fits within the well <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A lock protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> may be formed extending from a section of the back support, as for example the rear end member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the back support as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The lock protrusion fits into a corresponding groove <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> formed on the base portion when the back support is collapsed against the base portion. By making the protrusion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> from a flexible material, the lock protrusion compresses and expands into its corresponding groove <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> when the back support is collapsed against the base, thereby &ldquo;locking&rdquo; the back support against the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1,3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, depressions <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are formed in the sidewall <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> on opposite ends of the base to provide access for grasping and extending the back support from the base when the back support is locked in a closed or collapsed position against the base. In an alternate embodiment, only one depression is formed. By forming the base with two depressions that are linearly aligned with each other as in the exemplary embodiment, the depressions may be used to accommodate a pen or other object for providing a weight for stabilizing the base and obviating the need to secure the base to another object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> To operate the exemplary embodiment holder, a user pops open the back support from the base and extends it relative to the base. The support members <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are then pivoted up from the well floor and their heads <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are inserted into the corresponding slots <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> formed on the bottom surface of the back support. The support members retain the back support in an upright position. In a preferred embodiment, the back support is inclined relative to the base at an angle <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> between 60&deg; and 70&deg; when supported by the support members in the upright position. However, it is believed that a 64&deg; to 66&deg; angle is optimum for providing an angle <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> between the base and the document held of about 74&deg; to 76&deg;. By changing the length of the support members, the angle of the back support relative to the base can be changed. Furthermore, the angle of the document held in place by the holder can also be changed, although to a lesser degree, by changing the amount of resilience in the holding clip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and/or the angle of the holding clip convex surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> pressing against the document. The securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may also be removed from the well floor <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and inserted into the front slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to provide a means for anchoring the holder onto an object, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A single page or multiple pages of a document <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) may be positioned between the back support legs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the rear surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the holding clip member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The rear surface of the clip member attempts to push the page or pages through a plane tangential to the upper surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the back support. This causes the document <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to bend slightly as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and as shown by the dashed line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. This bending causes the document to be retained in an upright position. In the exemplary embodiment, the convex lower surface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the holding clip <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> imparts a smooth bend in the document <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The portable document holder of the present invention, when collapsed, is very compact, substantially flat, and relatively small. For example, the exemplary embodiment holder in its collapsed, compact configuration, may be about 6 cm (2.4 in.) wide by about 5 cm (2 in.) long and by about 1 cm (0.4 in.) high. The exemplary embodiment holder made from polypropylene has a weight, including the securing clip <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, of about 10 grams (&frac13; oz.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated with respect to various exemplary embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that it is not so limited, since changes and modifications may be made therein which are within the full intended scope of this invention as herein after claimed. For example, the base of the holder may be formed without a well. An external clip or other means may be used to retain the back support against the base when in the collapsed position. The support members and securing clip may still be stored in depressions or openings defined in the base. The well in the base may also be used to store other small accessories that may be useful to a person using the document holder. For example, a small keyboard brush may also be releasably attached to the well. </paragraph>
