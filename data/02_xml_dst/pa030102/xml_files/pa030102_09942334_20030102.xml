<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to electronic thermometers, in particular, to electronic thermometers having interchangeable or removable temperature probes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Electronic thermometers have been widely used for quick and accurate measurements of body temperature. A temperature sensing probe is inserted orally, rectally, or in an axillary (under the arm) position to measure a patient&apos;s temperature. The temperature sensitive probe is connected to thermal circuitry in a temperature calculating unit by an electrical cable. The temperature sensitive probe generates a signal. This signal passes through the electric cable to the temperature calculating unit, where the signal is converted into an equivalent temperature reading. The temperature calculating unit has a digital display which shows the calculated temperature reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Before each measurement, a disposable plastic probe cover is placed over the temperature probe. The probe cover is then disposed after each temperature reading and a new probe cover is used for each subsequent measurement. When not in use, the temperature sensitive probe is stored in a housing, well or recess associated with the temperature calculating unit to minimize probe damage and probe contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In typical use, prior art electronic thermometers are susceptible to at least three major sources of contamination. First, these thermometers employ the same temperature sensitive probes for oral, rectal and axillary temperature measurements. Even though disposable plastic probe covers are used for each measurement, cross-contamination may still result from use of the same probe. Therefore, rectal or axillary contaminants on the probe may be passed orally to the same and/or other patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The second source of contamination involves the probe storage chamber. Probes are stored in a single housing recess connected to the temperature calculating unit. This recess, once contaminated, may spread contamination to other probes as they may be interchangeably stored in the same recess. Over time, the storage chamber may also collect debris and contamination from the storage of multiple probes. Again, contaminants on the probe from rectal or axillary use may be passed orally to the same and/or other patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The third source of contamination relates to the disposable probe covers. Each time a patient&apos;s temperature is measured, the probe is inserted into a box of unused disposable probe covers. The temperature probes of the prior art share a common source of probe covers. Hence, probes used for taking rectal, oral and axillary temperatures are repeatedly inserted into the same source of probe covers. The probe, then, once contaminated, may spread contamination to other unused probe covers. Contaminants deposited on the unused probe cover may then be passed on to the same patient and/or other patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Since electronic thermometers are used for oral, axillary, and rectal temperature measurements, universal color codes have been adopted by hospitals, using red probes for rectal, temperature measurements and blue probes for oral and axillary temperature measurements. This color coding system makes it very easy for the healthcare practitioner to use the proper probe for each temperature reading, reducing the potential for cross-contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The use of a blue probe for oral and axillary temperature measurements and a red probe for rectal temperature measurements reduces the first source of contamination. Separating probe use in this manner also improves patient perception issues related to the health practitioners using the same probe for all types of temperature measurements. Such practice, however, requires two thermometer units to be available at each location if the probes are not interchangeable. Maintaining two units at each location has been considered an inefficient and costly measure. Such a practice also makes the practitioner susceptible to using the most convenient, yet inappropriate, unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Some have developed thermometers with detachable probe units. U.S. Pat. No. 4,008,614, assigned to Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., discloses an electronic thermometer unit usable with an oral temperature probe permanently attached to an oral isolation chamber. Similarly, there is a rectal probe permanently attached to a rectal isolation chamber. Connecting the probe and isolation chamber together as one unit thus precludes the inadvertent use of a probe with the wrong isolation chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,271, assigned to Cheesebrough-Pond&apos;s, Inc., discloses an independent replaceable probe unit including a probe member and a probe chamber for holding the probe member, which can be easily removed and replaced together as a unit. The probe, cable and isolation chamber are all the same color. The permanent connection assures that the health practitioner stores the probe in the proper isolation chamber, thus reducing the risk of contamination leading to infection. A significant limitation of each of these approaches is that, even though the probe is permanently attached to an isolation chamber, both the oral and rectal probe units will be repeatedly and interchangeably inserted into the same box or boxes of probe covers, still exposing the probe to possible contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,572,365, assigned to Cheesebrough-Pond&apos;s Inc., discloses an improved probe cover holding and dispensing arrangement, the objective of which is to provide convenient access to clean probe covers. An electronic thermometer housing contains a chamber for receiving a canon of probe covers. Once the canon is inserted and secured within the housing, an aperture in the thermometer housing, normally closed by a sliding cover, provides access to the inserted carton of probe covers. In this arrangement, however, the probe and isolation unit may be interchanged between oral and rectal without changing the cartridge of probe covers. Both oral and rectal probe units share access to the same source of probe covers, providing a source of cross-contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,260,058 to Seymour et al. discloses an arrangement of mounting a holder on top of the thermometer device to receive a cartridge of probe covers. However, in this approach, probe covers are still stored with the temperature calculating unit. The disclosed arrangement does not require a dedicated probe and isolation chamber. This again may allow both oral and rectal probes access to a shared source of probe covers, providing a source of contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Each of these prior art approaches fail to address the exposure to contamination as each temperature sensitive probe, oral or rectal, is repeatedly inserted into the same box or boxes of probe covers. In each approach, the same source of probe covers is used whether the covers are stored in connection with the temperature calculating unit or separate from the thermometer altogether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Co-pending application entitled &ldquo;Probe Tip Thermal Isolation and Fast Prediction Algorithm,&rdquo; Application Ser. No. &lsqb;not yet assigned&rsqb; filed on Jun. 27, 2001 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety discloses an electronic thermometer that reduces all three major sources of contamination and cross-contamination by eliminating the use of the same probe for oral, auxiliary and rectal temperature measurement, the use of the same storage chamber for each type of probe, and the use of the same supply of probe covers for each type of probe. The co-pending application discloses a removable module capable of receiving and storing both a temperature sensitive probe and a clean, uncontaminated supply of disposable probe covers. The removable module includes an isolation chamber that prevents the storage of the temperature sensitive probe with a probe cover remaining on the probe. The removable module also allows the practitioner to readily view a supply of probe covers through a transparent module housing without disassembling or physically contacting the removable module. A module housing aids in infection control by being easily cleaned or inexpensively replaced. A patient&apos;s exposure to all of the common sources of contamination encountered in the use of electronic thermometers is reduced by isolating the storage of the temperature sensitive probe and the disposable probe covers used for oral, auxiliary and rectal temperature measurement into dedicated units or modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> At least two types of removable modules are interchangeably operable with one temperature-calculating unit. The removable module is comprised of a probe assembly and a module housing. The module housing includes two chambers, one to store the probe and one to store a fresh supply of probe covers. Each of the module housing and probe assemblies are color coded according to the standard convention of red for rectal temperature measurement and blue for oral and auxiliary temperature measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Electronic thermometers as disclosed in the referenced co-pending application and electronic thermometers disclosed in the prior art typically employ temperature sensor elements in the probe such as thermisters. The thermisters and thermister circuits must be calibrated during manufacturing to compensate for component variation between thermisters and thermister circuits. For example, thermisters output a particular resistance value as a function of temperature. The resistance value is interpreted by the electronic components of the electronic thermometer as a temperature reading, or as an indication of a predicted temperature reading. If the thermister resistance has excessive variation or deviates from the nominal resistance at a particular temperature then, a compensation resistor must be installed during manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The calibration procedure is costly because it is labor intensive. During the calibration procedure, the resistance at the thermister must be measured at a controlled temperature and compensation resistors must be installed. Then, the resistance must be re-measured at a controlled temperature to assure that the calibration was successful. Expensive glass bulb thermisters having small component to component variation are used in typical electronic thermometer probes. These expensive thermistors also have a high thermal mass which increases the response time of the thermometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Calibration by using compensation resistors requires temperature probes to be calibrated at a single reference temperature. Single point calibration causes relatively high linearity errors in temperature calculations resulting in decreased accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The high costs associated with probe/sensor calibration and use of tight tolerance thermistors has made the use of multiple thermistors impractical in most probe applications. Some more accurate temperature calculation algorithms require input from more than one thermistor. Component costs have thereby rendered impractical the use of these more accurate temperature calculation algorithms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Although color coding and other identifying features has made probe units identifiable to users, interchangeable probe units of different types are not typically identifiable by the electronic hardware. This limits the ability of the temperature calculation components to adapt to variations between the probe unit types. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention reduces patient exposure to all sources of cross-contamination, aids in infection control, and provides a clean, uncontaminated, readily accessible source of probe covers. Embodiments of the present invention feature a probe assembly for an electronic thermometer, which does not require expensive calibration procedures during manufacturing and allows the use of inexpensive thermisters. A memory component such as an EEPROM stores calibration information and identifying information in the probe assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure provides various embodiments which locate the memory component proximately with electrical connecting components where the probe assembly is electrically mated to the thermometer base unit. A circuit board including the memory component is embedded in the strain relief portion of the probe cable by insert molding or encapsulation wherein only the mating portions of the connector are exposed. When the temperature probe assembly is electrically mated to the thermometer base unit, the memory component is in electrical communication with the electronics of the base unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Calibration information such as the resistance of the probe thermisters at corresponding calibration temperatures and probe identification data, i.e., serial numbers or probe type identifiers, is stored in the embedded memory component in the probe assembly. The electronic components of the base unit can read data from the memory component and compensate for variation in the probe thermisters according to the stored calibration information. The additional identifying information can be used by the thermometer base electronics to perform any number of functions. Such functions could include the use of separate algorithms for calculating a predicted temperature depending on the type of probe used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The invention of the present disclosure is particularly useful in electronic thermometers having interchangeable probe assemblies. Features of the invention include instant automatic identification of a temperature probe in a removable module. Effective interchangeability of different types of removable module-based temperature probes or different probes of the same type is featured without requiring labor intensive hardware modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The invention further features improved performance and accuracy over prior art electronic thermometers. Embodiments of the invention feature more than one temperature sensor in a temperature probe for improved accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The invention also features storage of all calibration parameters of the temperature sensors including calibration data for at least two different reference temperatures. This feature of the invention reduces linearity errors and improves a regression process used in the temperature calculation algorithm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The invention further features the use of a low cost, low thermal mass thermistor chip having a wide tolerance. This feature of the invention improves the thermal time constant and the overall response time of the thermometer as compared to conventional electronic thermometers which require tighter tolerance bulky glass bead type thermistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Further features of the invention include the reduction or elimination of calibration costs during manufacturing of temperature probe. Manufacturing costs are further reduced by mounting the memory component on the same small circuit board that acts as an interface between the probe cable conductors and their connector pins. Embodiments of the invention feature encapsulation of the memory components in a strain relief portion of the probe cable. Such encapsulation provides protection against fluid incursion into the electronic components and probe cable.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C wherein like numerals are used to designate like parts throughout. In cases where parts have similar form and function, similar numerals may be used for ease in interpretative cross referencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> thermometer according to the present invention is shown. The thermometer includes a temperature calculating unit and a removable module that is mated and secured to the temperature calculating unit. When the removable module is secured to the temperature calculating unit, a connector assembly component and a mating header assembly component are properly aligned and together form an electrical connection. This electrical connection allows a signal detected by a temperature probe to be transmitted from the removable module to the temperature calculating unit. Once received, the temperature calculating unit converts the signal to a temperature reading. The temperature reading is observed through a display window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to at least one embodiment of the present invention. Fastening means are provided to secure a removable module to the temperature calculating unit. In an illustrative embodiment, a pair of rails <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> are provided as fastening or alignment means to engage mating features in the removable module. Additional alignment means and securing means may be provided on the temperature calculating unit to facilitate mating with the removable module. For example, securing means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> includes tabs protruding from a battery compartment cover <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and engage mating features in the removable module. The battery compartment cover <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> may be made from an elastomeric material so that the securing means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> are flexible and making cover <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> easily removable from the top of the battery compartment. The battery cover <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> fits within an orifice <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> in the mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. A battery <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is situated within the battery compartment. In an illustrative embodiment, the top of the battery compartment coincides with a mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> which abuts the bottom surface of the removable module when the removable module is installed to the temperature unit. The mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> also provides a location for trigger devices <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> which may be located in recesses <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The trigger devices <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can be used to distinguish the particular type of removable module that is installed to the temperature calculation unit by providing strikers or protrusions at particular positions on the bottom surface of the removable module which identify the particular type of removable module being used. A slot <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is provided in the back surface <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of the temperature calculation unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The slot <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> engages the outer walls of an isolation chamber which protrudes from a front surface of the removable module. In the illustrative embodiment, the slot is shaped to provide a lead-in feature which assists in guiding the removable module while it is slidingly mated to the temperature calculation unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A button <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> mounted in the slot is linked to the electronics of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When depressed, the button <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> causes the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to turn off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> rear view of a removable module according to at least one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> for storing disposable probe covers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> which are packaged in cartons <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. The removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> further includes a temperature sensitive probe assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The probe assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> comprises a temperature sensitive probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and a first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The temperature sensitive probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is attached to electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), which is connected at its opposite end to the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The probe assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> locks into module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> at a housing orifice <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The probe assembly <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may be fixedly attached or unlocked and detached from the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> for replacement if needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> contains an isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is positioned in the center of the back side wall of the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. When not in use, the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is inserted into the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. When the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in its secured position with the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> rests between the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, providing additional physical protection to the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. For the purposes of the present disclosure, the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> maybe located anywhere within the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The inside diameter of the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> corresponds to the outside diameter of the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, such that, the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> cannot be inserted into the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> with the probe cover <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> still attached to the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Since the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are both components of the same removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> can be stored in only one isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, thus reducing the possibility of cross-contamination and spread of infection. If there is concern that the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has in any way been contaminated, the entire removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be removed for cleaning. Alternatively, the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may be inexpensively replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> At the bottom of the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, there is a switch actuating device such as a paddle indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) for triggering an automatic on/off mechanism. When the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is inserted into the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> during periods of nonuse, the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> pushes the paddle indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and bends it into contact with the button <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> on the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The button <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is linked to the electronics of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When actuated, the button <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> causes the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to turn off. Upon withdrawal of the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> from the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the paddle indicator releases. This causes the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to turn on and prepare for a temperature measurement. This automatic on/off mechanism conserves the battery life of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The paddle indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> may also be used as a reset button, indicating when a new temperature reading may be taken. If the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a tied shut off mechanism, the paddle indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> may be used to reactivate the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. This may be accomplished by inserting and removing the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> from the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, thus triggering the paddle indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and turning on the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The paddle indicator <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> may be any type of mechanical, electrical, magnetic or optical switch capable of differentiating between the presence and absence of the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> in the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> also contains a storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. A carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of disposable probe covers containing disposal probe covers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> fits snuggly into the storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> may be perforated with tabs such that the practitioner can pull the perforated tear-away tab and expose several probe covers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> may contain means to prevent the box of disposable covers from being removed and used interchangeably with other removable modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, the storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> may contain small projections <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> that puncture the sides of the carton of probe covers <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> such that attempts to remove the carton would cause the carton to tear. In another embodiment, the carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> may have a perforated bottom that tears. Therefore, if the carton is removed the bottom would tear out. The practitioner would then need to insert a fresh carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> of probe covers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> into the storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. This feature deters a practitioner from switching the probe covers from one removable module to another, increasing the potential for cross-contamination. The entire removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, including the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, the electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is color coded according to the standard convention of blue for oral and axillary measurements and red for rectal measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In addition to being color coded, the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment is transparent or translucent. Such a transparent housing allows the practitioner to conveniently view and count the number of probe covers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> remaining in the carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> at any given time. Transparency of the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> also allows the practitioner to read the information on the carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, including instructions for use, warnings and reordering information. The completely transparent module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is one example according to the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may have, for example, a single transparent portion, such as any one side, top, front or back panel. When the carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4</cross-reference>) contains a top perforated tab <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>, the contents may be viewed through a transparent top. Similarly, when the carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> contains a side panel perforation, the contents may be viewed through a transparent back panel on the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In these situations, it is necessary only to have one transparent or translucent top portion or side panel to the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> for viewing and counting. The module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> includes fastening means to aid in mounting the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the backside of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>B, the fastening means used in the current embodiment are tracks <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, which are molded, recesses in module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. These tracks <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> receive rails <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> on the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In addition, the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> contains securing means <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, which are also molded recesses in the module housing <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Recesses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> receive securing means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> located on a mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is attached to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by first aligning the rails <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> with tracks <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and securing means <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> with securing means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, then sliding the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> down on to the mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> until a locking tab <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> snaps into place over the top edge of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that fastening means, securing means and locking tabs, as defined by the present disclosure, could be any connection device or configuration of connection devices that serve to firmly secure the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in position on the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> located on the side to which the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is mounted. The second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) is wired to the thermometer circuitry within the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is secured to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> mate to form an electrical connection. The temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives the signal detected by the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, transmitted through the first <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connector components, and converts the signal into a temperature reading <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. The resulting temperature reading <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is observed through the display window <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The circuitry of temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is powered by a battery <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The battery <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is accessed through a cover <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> that fits into orifice <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> within mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, cover <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> is made from rubber to create a water tight seal, enabling the entire temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be submersed in water for cleaning. The cover <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> further comprises the securing means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> can be peeled away from the mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to expose and replace the battery <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, for example, referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>B, the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may also include means to detect the type of removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> secured to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Such means may include a two part switch which enables the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to sense the presence of an object connected to the mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may have a plurality of recesses <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> on the mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, each recess <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> containing a trigger device <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. There may be a plurality of corresponding protrusions, such as posts <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) on the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. When the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the posts <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> fit into the recesses <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, triggering the switches <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The switches <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are then sensed by the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Each type of removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may have a different number or location of posts <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. For example, an oral module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may have one post <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> which corresponds to switch <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> within recess <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, while the rectal module may have no posts <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to trigger switches <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Upon connection of the module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, triggering of the switches <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> will result in two alternative signals. These two part switches then enable temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to detect the type of movable module attached. Once the module type is detected, temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will calibrate in order to make the appropriate temperature measurements. Providing two recesses on the mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> gives the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> a capability of differentiating four different types of modules and operating accordingly. It should be understood, however, that the two part switches described may consist of any known electrical, mechanical, magnetic or optical switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In at least one embodiment, the first <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connector components may carry encoded information related to probe identity and associated calibration parameters. Such encoded information enables temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to detect the type of removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> attached. As shown on FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, spring loaded posts <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> on the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be used to engage contact pads <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> on second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 9A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C). It is contemplated that the first <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connector components may be any mechanical, electrical, magnetic or optical contacts such that when the two connection components are in proximity, a signal can pass from the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Thus, when removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> reads the encoded information carried by the attached removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and automatically sets the corresponding operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Now referring back to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, upon the connection of an oral/axillary type removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> reads the identity of the oral/axillary type probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. Whereupon, the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which is connected to the electronic circuitry of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, causes the display of an oral/axillary icon <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> located within window <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. This icon <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> indicates to the practitioner, that the thermometer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is ready to operate in the oral/axillary mode. Similarly, when a rectal type removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> reads the identity of the rectal type removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and displays a corresponding icon <highlight><bold>283</bold></highlight> within window <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>, indicating that the thermometer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is ready to operate in the rectal mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The operation of the thermometer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present disclosure will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When a temperature measurement is to be taken, the practitioner selects the appropriate module and mounts the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> on to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. By way of example, if an oral temperature measurement is desired, a blue removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is secured to temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by aligning the rails <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the tracks <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, once the rails <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> are aligned, the practitioner slides the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> downward such that the bottom of the module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> rests on mounting surface <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In this sliding action, the securing means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> is mated with recesses <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> until locking tab <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> snaps into place. When secured in this manner, first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> form the connection to activate the thermometer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The temperature sensitive probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is removed from the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, activating the thermometer to a ready mode. The probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is then inserted into a probe cover <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> within storage chamber <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. Insertion of the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> into the probe cover <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> creates a snap fit between the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and probe cover <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. The probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> with cover <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> attached. The practitioner pushes a button <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to select the oral or axillary mode. A short beep indicates that the thermometer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is ready to take a measurement. The probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is inserted into the patient&apos;s mouth. When the measurement is complete a long beep is sounded and the final temperature reading <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is displayed. Temperature reading <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is observed through display window <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. The probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is then withdrawn from the patient&apos;s mouth and a probe button <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is depressed to eject the probe cover <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> into an appropriate waste container. The probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> may then be inserted into another probe cover <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> in the carton <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> again if another reading is desired. Alternatively, the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> is inserted back into the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> for storage. The insertion of the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> into the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> switches the thermometer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to standby mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If a rectal temperature measurement is next desired, it is necessary only to change the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. To remove the oral type removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the practitioner first pulls back on a locking tab <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. Once the locking tab <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is released, the practitioner slides the oral type removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> off of rails <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> to disengage it from the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The rectal type removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is then secured to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the manner described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the probe covers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> are contained within one unit, i.e., the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> prevents the interchangeable use of the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and probe covers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Thus, the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the current disclosure reduces all major sources of contamination by preventing the commingling of the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, the isolation chamber <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the disposable probe covers <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the thermometer unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the current disclosure remains cost effective since it requires only one temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to use with all types of probes <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> According to the present disclosure, the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is instantly detectable and identifiable to the electronic components in the temperature calculation unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, illustrative embodiments of the thermometer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shown. FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C further show illustrative embodiments of the connector components according to the present invention. An electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM Integrated Circuit (IC) Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is soldered onto a small printed circuit board (PCB) <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) and configured to the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). At least part of the PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is overmolded and encapsulated. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B illustrate a partially assembled first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> including PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> having an EEPROM IC <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> soldered thereon. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> prior to its assembly to the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and strain relief <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>) are coupled together prior to assembly to the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Spring loaded posts <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> provide electrical connectivity between the electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> in the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is in electrical communication with the electronic components of the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the electrical connections to the PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are protected from environmental factors by being encapsulated or over-molded. Such encapsulation renders these components water resistant and meets the Comite European de Normalisation-European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization&apos;s (CEN) water resistance compliance requirement. The particular EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> used in thermometer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include, for instance, a Parasite Power 256 Bit Single Wire Communicating 1-Wire EEPROM IC Chip such as the DS2430A model available from Dallas Semiconductor. The data sheet for the Dallas Semiconductor model DS2430A is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The data line of the EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is directly connected to a single port pin of the thermometer microprocessor. The EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> does not require any separate power connections because it receives power from the data line. The particular DS2430A model EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> communicates with the microprocessor at up to 16.3K bits per second. It is contemplated that various microprocessor communication speeds are with the spirit of the present disclosure. Upon power up, the microprocessor automatically reads a unique, factory laser-programmed and validated 64 bit registration number to identify the probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor then reads pre-stored 256 bit calibration and algorithm parameters which characterize the particular temperature probe in which the EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is imbedded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In at least one embodiment of the invention, one end of the electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is attached to the temperature probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) and the other end of the electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is connected to the PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A, 5B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). The PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes eight (8) conductive metal (e.g., gold) plated pads; five (5) of which are connected to five (5) conductors located within electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>; two (2) of which are connected to the EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. It is hereby contemplated that the particular connections between the EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> may be varied dependent upon the particular integrated circuits, circuit boards, cables and electrical connections used. In one embodiment, the PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> containing the EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> slides into the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>) before it is overmolded. In an alternate embodiment, the portion of the PCB <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> containing the EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and cable connections are sealed and overmolded together with the strain relief <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. In either embodiment, the overmolded connector portion of the electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is permanently attached to the wall of the removable module (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). The first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> housing is designed so that it can be inserted and locked into a mating space in the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> so that the temperature probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and electrical cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> becomes an integral part of the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and its terminals pins or pads <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> are environmentally encapsulated so that there is no fluid penetration into the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and temperature calculation unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> case. The mating second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 9A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>C) includes stamped metal terminal pins <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> which are inserted into the connector housing <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and sealed. The backend of these terminal pins <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> are soldered onto a printed circuit board of the temperature calculation unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> during the assembly process of other components. The connector housing <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is aligned and installed into a cavity (not shown) behind the back surface <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the temperature calculation unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, providing for a sealing arrangement between the back surface <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of the temperature calculation unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> including the terminal pins <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and the connector housing <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>. This sealing arrangement eliminates the possibility of any fluid ingression to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment of a second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference>. Grooves <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> on each side of the periphery of the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> accepts and locks mating flanges <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> on the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 6B</cross-reference>) to form an electrical connection when the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>) is installed to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The flanges <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> situated along the periphery of the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> slide into the grooves <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> in the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> when the removable module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is slidingly mated to the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Engagement between the flanges <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> on the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the grooves <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> ensure that spring loaded posts <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are held in secure electrical contact with contact pads <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. Engagement between the flanges <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> on the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the grooves <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> on the second connector component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> also prevents fluid from reaching the contact area where it could potentially degrade the electrical contacts between the spring loaded posts <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the contact pads <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> or enter inside the temperature calculating unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, embedded in the first connector component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, holds all the necessary information and/or parameters that are required for an accurate two-point calibration of the thermistor sensors in each associated temperature probe <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). This information includes calibration related parameters such as thermistor resistor values at two different temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> also holds information necessary for identifying the probe and probe type. This information includes the probe identification information related to type of removable module (rectal, or oral/axillary), unique assembly part numbers, date codes, Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) and other manufacturing related data. In an illustrative embodiment using the EEPROM IC Chip model DS2430A available from Dallas Semiconductor, the identifying information includes a unique factory laser-programmed and validated 64 bit registration number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Although the memory component described herein is implemented illustratively in the form of an EEPROM Chip <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, it is contemplated that the temperature probe adapter according to the present disclosure can be implemented by various circuit configurations and/or memory elements. In an alternate embodiment, a radio-frequency (RF) transmission technique, that is wireless communication, can also be used to communicate between the temperature calculating unit or any other calibration station with the detachable ISO-Chamber based temperature probe assembly. The probe cable <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> can have an embedded Read only (R) or Read/Write (R/W) RFID-radio frequency identification transponder tag or microchip. The on-the-chip EEPROM can be wirelessly read and written from the base unit, i.e., the temperature calculating unit or any other calibration station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Although the present disclosure is described herein with respect to illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be appreciated that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions or additions in the form and detail thereof may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. It is to be understood that the described embodiments of the disclosure are illustrative only, and that modifications thereof may occur to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, this disclosure is not to be regarded as limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is to be limited only as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
