<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for writing on an optical disk figures such as letters and pictures visible with naked eyes, and also to an optical disk apparatus having a function to visibly write on an optical disk figures such as letters and pictures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are several principles of recording information on a thin film (recording film) by irradiation with a laser beam. Among them, the one which utilizes the change of atomic arrangement by irradiation with a laser beam, such as the phase change (also called phase transition) and photo-darkening of the film material, which is accompanied by very little deformation of thin film, has the advantage that an optical disk of double-side disk structure or a multi-layer optical disk having a plurality of information planes is obtained by directly bonding together two sheets of disk members. Such optical disks as conventional CD-R, CD-RW, PD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD-RAM reproduce recorded information by using an apparatus with built-in laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The conventional optical disk needs a reproducing apparatus with a built-in laser source for reproduction of information recorded on an optical disk. Also, the content which the user has recorded on an optical disk could not be confirmed unless the optical disk is reproduced by the reproducing apparatus. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is intended to provide an optical disk that makes visible letters and marks without requiring a reproducing apparatus. Also, the present invention is intended to provide a method of recording visible letters, pictures, and marks on an optical disk without requiring a reproducing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An optical disk is a discoid recording medium in which information which can be reproduced by using difference in reflectivity has been recorded or can be recorded. An optical disk comes in various types, such as the one which has one layer of recording film, the one which has two or more multiple layers of recording film, the one which has a ROM region and a RAM region, the one which is capable of recording and reproducing many times, and the one which is capable of recording once and permits reproduction many times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For the recording film of an optical disk, phase-changing materials such as Ge&mdash;Sb&mdash;Te, In&mdash;Sb&mdash;Te, Ag&mdash;In&mdash;Sb&mdash;Te, germanide, antimonide, telluride, indide, etc. are usually used. An optical disk that uses a phase-changing material for the recording film records information by utilizing the fact that the phase-changing material of the recording film is made crystalline or amorphous by irradiation with a laser bean which has been modulated by recording information and performs reproduction of information by utilizing the difference in reflectivity between the crystalline region and amorphous region. It is also possible to use for the recording film an organic pigment capable of discoloration by light irradiation/heating in addition to the phase-changing material. The optical disk that uses an organic pigment for the recording film performs recording and reproducing by utilizing the fact that hue changes because the discolored region and the colored region differ in reflectivity at visible wavelengths. The optical disk that uses an organic pigment is the same as the optical disk that uses the phase-changing material in writing method and reproducing method except that rewriting is impossible, if amorphous is replaced by discoloration and crystalline is replaced by coloration in the phase-changing material. The present invention can be applied to optical disks of any type so long as they are optical disks having a recording film or recording region capable of recording by a laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the difference in reflectivity in the case where a typical optical disk recording film material is made crystalline and amorphous, with the abscissa representing wavelength and the ordinate representing reflectivity. Ramo is reflectivity when the recording film material is made amorphous and Rcry is reflectivity when it is made crystalline. Recording of information in an ordinary optical disk is accomplished by forming amorphous recording marks by laser beam irradiation along the track of the crystalline recording film. And, reproduction of recording information is accomplished by reading off the position of recorded marks or the position of mark edges by utilizing difference in reflectivity between the crystalline region and the amorphous region. The track width of the optical disk is about 0.1-0.8 &mgr;m and the mark length is about 0.1-8 &mgr;m, and since recording marks are extremely small, it is impossible to recognize individual recording marks with naked eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present inventors turned their attention to the fact that the reflectivity of the crystalline region and amorphous region of the optical disk recording film material greatly varies in visible region, and conceived that if large letters and pictures crossing a plurality of tracks are depicted as figures in the recording film by connecting amorphous regions, it will be possible to recognize them with naked eyes by difference in reflectivity between the amorphous region constituting the letters and pictures and the surrounding crystalline region, and developed a method for writing such figures and a figure writing apparatus to realize it. Incidentally, the figure writing apparatus can be realized by incorporating a program for figure writing in an ordinary optical disk recording apparatus. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODYMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In what follows, the mode of carrying out the invention will be explained with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram showing one example of the optical disk apparatus having a function of writing figures according to the present invention. Incidentally, for the convenience of explanation, how the optical disk <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is mounted on the apparatus is shown. Although the optical disk <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is essential to write information, the optical disk <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is dismounted from and mounted on the optical disk apparatus according to need. The optical disk apparatus is constructed of a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, an optical head <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> which is capable of moving in the radial direction of the optical disk <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and is provided with a photodetector <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and an object lens <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, a motor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which turns and drives the optical disk <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a laser driver <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> which drives the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> according to the pattern generated by a pattern generating circuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, a system controller <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> which controls the entire apparatus, an operating system <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, an application soft <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, and an input means <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> which enters data recording information and figure writing information. Incidentally, although not shown, the optical head <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is provided with an actuator to control the position in the optical axis direction of the object lens <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the position in the direction vertical to the optical axis for autofocusing and tracking, and is provided with a servocontroller which generates actuator driving signals based on signals detected by the optical head <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> When the optical disk is mounted on the optical disk apparatus having a figure writing function and instructions of figure writing and information of figures to be written are delivered from the upper level controllers such as the application soft <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and operating system <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> through the input means <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, the system controller <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> positions the focal point of the laser beam generated from the optical head <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> at an adequate position of an adequate information layer on the optical disk <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and drives the laser driver <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and writes figures according to the writing pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a function detailed diagram explaining one example of the system controller. Input signals from the input means <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> are delivered to the file system <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of the system controller <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> through the application soft <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and operating system <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and accumulated in the buffer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through the device driver <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The function of the application soft <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, operating system <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, file system <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, and device driver <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> which are surrounded by broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is realized by the software <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. This software <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> differs from the software of an ordinary optical disk apparatus which only performs data recording and reproduction in that &ldquo;a function to control the data recording area and the figure writing area&rdquo; is added. &ldquo;The function to control the data recording area and the figure writing area&rdquo; is assigned to the file system <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> or the device driver <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing one example of the sector arrangement of the optical disk. In the case where a figure is written together with a record of data in a sheet of optical disk, the logical user region in which the user can record data or write a figure is divided into the logical user region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> for data recording and the logical user region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for figure writing so as to control. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the sector number of the logical user region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> for data recording is allocated to the smaller ones (from 0 to k&minus;1) and the logical user region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for figure writing is allocated to the larger ones (from k to z), thereby establishing separately in the optical disk. If the data recording area is allocated to that of larger sector number, errors are liable to occur during reproduction in the data recording area; therefore, it is established in this way. The ratio of k and z is determined by the application, and in the case of a disk for figure writing only which has no data recording area, k&equals;0. In the case where half an area of the region capable of recording of the optical disk is used as a figure writing, k is an integer value of approximately a half of z. Incidentally, in consideration of compatibility with the existing system in which the handling of recording data is 16 sectors each, making k a multiple of 16 is desirable because the waste of capacity is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the case where the division of the data recording area and the figure writing area is accomplished by the file system <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> of the system controller <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the arrangement information of the logical user region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> for data recording and the logical user region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for figure writing is recorded in the logical user region for recording in the user region in the optical disk and referenced at the time of recording-reproducing. In the case where the division of the data recording area and the figure writing area is accomplished by the device driver <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, the arrangement information of the logical user region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> for data recording and the logical user region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for figure writing is controlled for each application by the device driver <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and referenced at the time of recording&middot;reproducing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the case where a single layer of recording film is divided into the data recording area and the figure writing area, it is desirable that the data recording area is allocated to that closer to the lead-in area than the figure writing area and the figure writing area is allocated to that far from the lead-in area. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in the optical disk <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> like DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD-R, CD-R, and CD-RW which has the lead-in area inside, the data recording area <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> for recording digital data is formed inside and the figure writing area <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> in which letters and figures (such as pictures) visible with naked eyes are written is formed outside. The ratio of the size of the data recording area <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the figure writing area <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> can be determined for each object; however, in order to recognize with naked eyes the letters and pictures written in the figure writing area <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, it is necessary that the width in the disk radial direction of the figure writing area <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> should be 0.01 mm or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the case of an optical disk, such as double-layer disk, which has recording film in multiple layers, it is permissible to allocate the data recording area and the figure writing area to different recording films. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a sectional schematic diagram showing one example of a double-layer disk having two layers of recording film. The optical disk <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of this example has a structure that a first recording film <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and a second recording film <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> are laminated on a substrate <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> holding a spacer layer <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> between them and a protective coat <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> is formed to the upper most layer. In the case of such an optical disk <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> having multiple recording films, if the figure writing area is formed at the light incident side, the reflectivity change is large and the recording power variation becomes large; therefore, it is desirable to allocate the recording film <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> near the light incident side to the data recording area to record digital data and to allocate the recording film <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> far from the light incident side to the figure writing area to write letters and pictures visible with naked eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a descriptive diagram showing one example of in which pictures and letters as visible figures are written in one layer of recording film of multiplayer disk according to the present invention. The optical disk <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> of this example has a recording film of phase-change type recordable by the user, and visible figures <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and letters <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> are written in the recording film. In writing pictures and letters, like the case of recording ordinary digital data, the optical disk is irradiated with a laser beam according to figure data of pictures and letters to bring about phase change in a prescribed region of the recording film. If a material capable of irreversible phase change is used for the recording medium, the above-mentioned figures such as pictures and letters can be rewritten, and visible figures can be rewritten as from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), according to the change of situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Here, in the case of ordinary data recording, in the user region as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) a modulating method such that the ratio of the crystalline region (space portion) <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and the amorphous region (mark portion) <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> is distributed approximately evenly (5:5) in the circumferential direction in the recording region of the recording film is adopted, but in writing visible pictures and letters the mark by amorphous region is formed in a macro gather across a plurality of tracks in the crystalline region on the recording film; therefore, the ratio of the crystalline region (non-writing portion) and the amorphous region (writing portion) is not limited to approximately even. To make it more readily visible, in the macro gather in the writing region, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), if the ratio of crystalline region (non-writing portion)/amorphous region (writing portion) in the circumferential direction in the recording region of the recording film is made 6/4 or above, the contrast becomes large and therefore this is desirable. Like this, the amorphous region and the crystalline region of the recording film differ in reflectivity distribution in visible wavelengths and marks by the amorphous region gather to form a large region and therefore hue/lightness/ saturation varies and it becomes possible to recognize with naked eyes written pictures and letters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an example in which visible letters have been written according to the present invention in the optical disk shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This disk <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> performs recording and reproduction of ordinary digital data by using the data recording area set in the zone inside the inner circumference and writes the visible letter <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> in the figure writing area <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> set in the zone outside the outer circumference. The visible letters are rewritable, and it is possible to write additional letters <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> like from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) according to change in situation. Writing of pictures and signs as well as letters is also possible in the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The synchronizing method in the circumferential direction of the disk regarding positioning, synchronizing, and access method at the time of figure writing is as per written below. In the disk, information which shows the kind of disk is recorded, and the sector arrangement on the disk is judged based on this. Positioning, synchronizing, and access at the time of figure writing are accomplished according to tracking signals, ID reproducing signals of pit, and wobble signals due to irregularities and deformation attaching to the substrate of the optical disk. If synchronizing and/or position detecting is performed by address information such as tracking signals, ID reproducing signals of pit, and wobble signals due to irregularities and deformation set on the substrate of the optical disk, the accuracy of the writing position rise, and more distinct letters and/or pictures, signs are written and it is preferable. In addition, as shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is permissible to perform positioning, synchronizing, and access from the moving distance from the reference point of the innermost circumference. The reference point may be other position instead of the innermost circumference. In this case, in the case of a certain amount of movement, by issuing synchronizing signals in the radial direction, the amount of movement from the radial position can use the driving signals/moving time signals etc. for a certain period of time as the synchronizing signals in the radial direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The optical disk of the present invention having the figure writing function has a corresponding table for arrangement information of sectors and coordinates for figure writing for each kind of disk such as CD-R, CD-RW, PD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD-RAM. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a diagram showing one example of the relation of the sector arrangement and the coordinates for figure writing. According to this example, sector <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> corresponds to the coordinate (R<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>)&tilde;(R<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) and the sector <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> corresponds to the coordinates (R<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>)&tilde;(R<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>). The figure based on the data for figure writing is caused to correspond to the sector on the optical disk upon development into the coordinates for figure writing, and the pattern for laser driving is generated based on it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Next, we explain regarding the processing example of the case of writing letters, figures, or pictures on the recording surface of the optical disk. Here, we explain regarding the example in which data such as image data and letters input from the keyboard as an index for it are written in the visible form. The index data are data which may be input by the user or data attached to the recording data such as pictures or data determined by the system. Taking image data such as photographs as an example, it is possible to write the title and date and time of image as the index. For example, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows, the title together with the image data is written as visible letters, and subsequently other image data are recorded and it is possible to additionally write the title as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In addition, the using method such as writing the owner or the user ID or the capacity of the optical disk as the index is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a process example in the case where visible figures are written in the optical disk. As the disk is thrown in/the apparatus power source is thrown in, the discrimination process of whether the figure writable disk or not is performed (step <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>) first. In the case where a ROM disk or a disk of other standard than the apparatus is thrown in, the error process is performed as being not writable (step <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>). If the disk is figure writable, then the discrimination process of disk kind is performed next (step <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>). In the discrimination step of disk kind, correspondence between the coordinates for figure writing and the sector arrangement of the optical disk is performed as explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Then, figure writing data is entered (step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>). As data is entered, the writing of figure data is performed though the writing preparation (step <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>). After the figure writing process has been completed, process is repeated by returning from step <highlight><bold>1207</bold></highlight> to step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> if there are additional data, and the process terminates if there are no input data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The figure writing preparation and figure writing process are performed under the control of the system controller <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The figure writing preparation is a process of moving the optical head to the figure writing position on the optical disk, encoding the writing content and the writing color tone, and transmitting to the writing means. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when an input signal containing the address information showing the writing content and the place to start writing to the optical disk is sent to the system control <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the information is stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and is sent to the controller <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. In the controller <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, the synchronizing signal output from the synchronizing circuit <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and the input signal from the buffer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are set to the encoder <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> in timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a descriptive diagram showing the detail of processing in the encoder <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. The figure writing data (character &ldquo;N&rdquo; in the example shown) entered from the keyboard is, after addition of font size information, developed into the coordinates for figure writing, and conversion into the actual figure writing coordinates set on the disk is performed. For example, &ldquo;N&rdquo; is developed into X-coordinate axis 1&tilde;20, Y-coordinate 1&tilde;20. Writing is performed in the area corresponding to (X<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), (X<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), (X<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) of these. Based on this writing information and the corresponding table of the sector and the figure writing coordinate as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the figure writing pattern is formed. In the case of the shown example, (X<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), (X<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), (X<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) are converted into (R<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>), (R<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), (R<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>), respectively, so as to correspond the write starting point (R<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) of the figure writing coordinate on the disk with (X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) of the coordinates for figure writing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is an enlarged diagram of the coordinates for figure writing and the letter &ldquo;N&rdquo; which has been developed thereon. The region (X<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) which becomes (R<highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) after conversion is formed from a plurality of amorphous regions, as shown enlarged under <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. In this, for simplification, it is formed with 8 tracks, but to be actually visible, the area shown with one coordinate point of the coordinates for figure writing needs an area larger than 0.01 mm&times;0.01 mm, for example, in the case of an optical disk having a track width about 0.6 &mgr;m wide, it is necessary to correspond to about 17 tracks or more and a length more than 0.01 mm. The shape of the region of 0.01 mm&times;0.01 mm more may be a square, rectangle, trapezoid, hexagon, triangle, or a shape close to them. Also, for the written figure to be visible, it is necessary to cause the reflectivity change more than 5% compared with the surrounding at any of visible wavelengths to occur in the region of width more than about 0.01 mm&times;0.01 mm. The reflectivity change is referred to as the average reflectivity change in the region. Either in the case where the area in which the reflectivity change occurred is small or in the case where the reflectivity change is small, it was difficult to recognize the written figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a descriptive diagram regarding the formation of writing waveform. In the encoder <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of the system controller <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, based on the corresponding table of the sector and the figure writing coordinates, on the basis of the figure developed in the figure writing coordinates, the fundamental writing pattern taking timing in response to the synchronizing signal for each tack following the recording order is formed. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> writing pattern corresponding to the figure writing coordinates (R<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) on the disk was illustratively shown. In the pattern generating circuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, a writing pattern is added to this in response to the color tone and a final writing waveform is generated and stored in the buffer. Regarding the color tone, we will mention later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, by driving the laser driver <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by the writing waveform output from the pattern generating circuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> emits light, the laser beam modulated in terms of time in response to information to be written from the optical head <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is irradiated to the optical disk <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and a figure consisting of letters and pictures is written on the optical disk <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The driving current of the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is changed in synchronism with the synchronizing signal in the circumferential direction of the optical head <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> or the writing clock fundamental wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Here, we explain regarding the color tone. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a schematic diagram which showed the power level (writing waveform) and the writing content at the time of modulating the laser light for one track portion in one coordinate point of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and making amorphous the recording film of the optical disk. The black dot portion shown under the recording waveform represents the region in which the recording film of phase-change type has been made amorphous by laser beam irradiation. In the drawing, Tw represents the window width, Pw represents the writing power, and Pe represents the erasing power. In this way, as the recording film is made amorphous by irradiating the recoding film of the optical disk with a high power, a plurality of amorphous regions formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. When this is viewed, it looks as though one letter &ldquo;N&rdquo; is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Also, when a high power is partially omitted at the modulation time of laser beam, the ratio which the amorphous region occupies decreases and the ratio which the crystalline region occupies increases. Like this, if the area ratio of the amorphous region per one coordinate region is made small and the average reflectivity difference is made smaller, the contrast at the viewing time decreases, and it is possible to change the level of color tone compared with the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). If the average reflectivity difference is changed stepwise like this, it is possible to change the level of color tone stepwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In addition, the method of changing the color tone level may be decreasing the number and length of the amorphous region <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) or decreasing part of the power to make amorphous as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), making it multipulse, narrowing the width of the amorphous region <highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>, or making small the power to make amorphous narrowing the amorphous region. It is permissible to adopt the method of changing the writing track number, such as leaving the figure writing track alternately. Here, we explained regarding the example of forming a figure consisting of letters and pictures in the amorphous region, but it may be permissible to form a figure in the crystalline region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The data recording performs recording without space sequentially in the address order from the smaller address number except in the case where it becomes a recording unable region due to error. However, the figure writing does not write in the address order but is written on the basis of the writing pattern only in the area which needs writing on the basis of the writing coordinates. In this case, in the no-writing region such as (X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), (X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), (X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Y<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), . . . in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, writing is not performed. Therefore, writing is performed at random addresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the case where the data to perform figure writing is image data, the input data becomes the pattern information which has developed the image on the coordinates as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. In addition to taking out the image data from the external input, it is permissible to read out data previously stored in the optical disk apparatus. Subsequent processing such as conversion of written coordinates onto the disk and writing pattern preparation is the same as the case in which figure writing is performed based on the character data entered from the keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As the method of rewriting, in case of writing after overall erasing of the rewriting region before figure writing, although rewriting time is long, there is no dislocation of letters and pictures written previously and letters and pictures to be newly written, it is written beautifully. And, there is no need to record the previously written content in the optical disk of the optical disk apparatus, and the system is inexpensive. In the case where only altered points are rewritten without overall erasure, it is necessary to record the previously written content in the optical disk or the optical disk apparatus, but there is an advantage of reducing the writing time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing a process example in the case where a figures such as letters and pictures is written in the figure writing area of the same optical disk using the figure writing data recorded in the data recording area of the optical disk. As the disk is thrown in/the apparatus power source is thrown in, the discrimination process of whether the figure writable disk or not is performed (step <highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight>) first. In the case where a ROM disk or a disk of other standard than the apparatus is thrown in, the error process is performed as being not writable (step <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>). If the disk is figure writable, then the discrimination process of disk kind is performed next (step <highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight>). In the discrimination step of disk kind, correspondence between the coordinates for figure writing and the sector arrangement of the optical disk is performed as explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Then, data for figure writing is read from the data recording area (step <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight>). As data is entered, the writing of figure data is performed though the writing preparation (step <highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight>). After the figure writing process has been completed, process is repeated by returning from step <highlight><bold>1807</bold></highlight> to step <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> if there are additional data, and the process terminates if there are no data for figure writing. When the content of visible figure recorded in the figure writing area is contained in the record data of the optical disk as above, it is possible to correspond the written content with the record content of the optical disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> It is possible to form the ROM region and RAM region in the optical disk so that data for figure writing is stored in the ROM region and visible figures such as pictures and letters are written in the area for figure writing set in the RAM. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a disk having such a ROM region and RAM region, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a schematic plan view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a schematic AA&prime; sectional view thereof. This optical disk <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> has the ROM region <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight> formed inside in which an application program such as game for example and data for writing visible figures such as pictures and letters used in the phase in the advance of the game is stored and the RAM region formed outside in which data is recorded and visible letters and pictures are written. The ROM region <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight> has the ROM reflecting layer <highlight><bold>1912</bold></highlight> formed on the ROM substrate <highlight><bold>1911</bold></highlight> and the RAM region has the RAM recording film <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight> formed on the RAM substrate <highlight><bold>1921</bold></highlight>. The protective coat <highlight><bold>1923</bold></highlight> is formed on the ROM reflecting layer <highlight><bold>1912</bold></highlight> and the RAM recording film <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a process diagram to explain the manufacturing method of the optical disk shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), on a polycarbonate substrate in which both of a RAM substrate <highlight><bold>1921</bold></highlight> diameter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> cm, thickness 0.6 mm having grooves for tracking on the surface and a ROM substrate <highlight><bold>1911</bold></highlight> having concave-convex information are combined a ROM reflecting layer material <highlight><bold>1915</bold></highlight> is made film through the outer circumferential and central mask <highlight><bold>1914</bold></highlight>, and a ROM reflecting layer <highlight><bold>1912</bold></highlight> was made. Then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), through the inner circumferential and central mask <highlight><bold>1924</bold></highlight>, the RAM recording film material <highlight><bold>1925</bold></highlight>, that is, the lower protective layer, the RAM recording film, the upper protective layer, and the reflective layer are sequentially formed, and the RAM recording film <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight> was formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The protective coat was formed further thereon. As the protective layer material, ZnS&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, oxide, nitride, etc., and as the reflective layer, Al alloy, Ag alloy, Au alloy, etc. were used. The formation of the laminate layer was performed by a magnetron sputtering apparatus. After that, the protective coat <highlight><bold>1923</bold></highlight> was formed on the ROM reflective layer <highlight><bold>1912</bold></highlight> and RAM recording film <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight>. After the protective coat layer <highlight><bold>1923</bold></highlight> was formed, initialization of the RAM recording film <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight> was performed. Here, the ROM reflective layer <highlight><bold>1912</bold></highlight> was formed before the RAM recording film <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight>, but this order may be reversed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Then, we explain regarding an example of the case to which the present invention was applied to game. In the optical disk a program of game as an application program is recorded and figure writing data for visible pictures and letters is also recorded. These data can be recorded in the ROM region of the optical disk. Also, the optical disk has the RAM region to write figures such as visible pictures and letters. It is supposed that the game proceeding information showing in which stage the game was finished at the previous game finish time and the information showing figures for which stage was written in the disk plane at the previous game finish time are recorded in the RAM region of the optical disk. As an example, we explain regarding &ldquo;Kappa Game&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Kappa Game&rdquo; assumed herein is a game to forecast weather from such items as outlook weather, weather chart, air temperature, infrared photographs from satellites, etc. There are a plurality of stages according to the degree of ease and difficulty of weather forecast. If the weather forecast comes true, it is possible to proceed to the next stage. At the game start time and until the stage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is cleared, the figure writing of the initial state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is performed on the disk plane. Each time the stage is cleared the writing information to the disk plane is altered, when the stage <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is cleared the visible pictures and letters as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are written in the optical disk plane, and after the final stage has been finished the pictures and letters as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) are to be written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a flow chart concerning the figure writing process to the disk plane which is executed with the advance of this game. As the optical disk in which the game program is stored is loaded into the optical disk apparatus and the game starts, the optical disk apparatus reads information at the previous game finish recorded in the RAM region in the optical disk, that is, the game advance information showing at what stage the game was completed (step <highlight><bold>2101</bold></highlight>). Also, in the same way, information showing figures for what stage are written in the current disk plane is read out from the RAM region of the optical disk (step <highlight><bold>2102</bold></highlight>). After that, the game proceeds by the user&apos;s input action in response to the game program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> When the stage is cleared, the judgment of the step <highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight> becomes Yes, the advance information of the game is transmitted to the system controller, the figure writing data is read from the ROM region in accordance with the &ldquo;stage clear information&rdquo; showing what stage has been cleared (step <highlight><bold>2104</bold></highlight>). The system controller converts the figure writing data which has been read into the waveform for writing and the writing position information, performs the figure writing process (step <highlight><bold>2105</bold></highlight>). In the case where the judgment of step <highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight> is No, it judges whether or not to finish the game (step <highlight><bold>2106</bold></highlight>), returns to step <highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight> in the case of game continuation. Also, in the case where the game is finished, the game proceeding information is recorded in the RAM region of the optical disk (step <highlight><bold>2107</bold></highlight>), after recording the figure of what stage is written in the disk plane (step <highlight><bold>2108</bold></highlight>), it ends. Thus, the pictures and letters visible with naked eyes which appear on the disk plane of the optical disk change as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The users of the game bring their own game disks and can enjoy showing one another how many stages they have cleared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Here, we explained regarding the example in which the figure writing data is recorded in the same optical disk as that in which the game program was recorded, but it is not always necessary to store the figure writing data in the optical disk. For example, the figure writing data may be stored in the optical disk apparatus (game machine) or the application soft. In this case, the figure writing data is read from the optical disk apparatus or application soft according to the stage clear information and transmitted to the writing means. Also, it is not always necessary to record in the optical disk the game advance information showing the stage at which the game was finished or the information showing the disk plane in which the figure for the stage is written, the information may be held in the game machine (optical disk apparatus). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Also, as the figure writing means, the type causing the atomic arrangement change of the recording film material by irradiating the recording film with a laser beam as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is preferable because the precision of the writing position is high. However, causing the atomic arrangement change of the recording film material by irradiating the recording film with light such as xenon lamp and halogen lamp other than laser beam is acceptable. By this method, the writing position precision is worse compared with the method of laser beam irradiation, it is possible to shorten the writing time. Moreover, causing the atomic arrangement change by heating with other means than heat is also acceptable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the case where the figure writing is performed by laser irradiation, if the spot shape of laser beam is a circle or close to a circle, larger than the minimum value of recording mark length/width, and less than two times of the above-mentioned minimum value, the reproduction of the recorded mark is possible and the figure writing is also possible and therefore preferable. In order to perform the figure writing at a high speed, there is a method to use a light spot of elongated circle or ellipse long in the disk radial direction, but is not suitable for the reproduction of the recorded marks. If it has an optical head having both of the spot shapes which change into a circle or close to a circle at the recording&middot;reproducing time of data and an elongated circle or an ellipse at the figure writing time, the recording&middot;reproducing of data is possible and the figure writing time becomes short and therefore is preferable. Also, it may have two kinds of optical heads for the recording&middot;reproducing of the recording marks and for the figure writing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the present invention, it is possible to write visible letters and pictures on an optical disk. </paragraph>
