<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a heart-sound detecting apparatus and particularly to such an apparatus which detects a heart sound by extracting or determining, from a physical signal containing a heart-sound component, the heart-sound component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art Statement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Heart sounds are detected to make diagnosis of heart disease. In addition, heart sounds may be detected to determine, in combination with a pulse wave, a pulse-wave propagation velocity at which the pulse wave propagates through a living subject. In addition, since pulse-wave propagation velocity reflects arteriosclerosis which, in turn, directly relates to hypertension, it is desirable to measure, at home, the velocity as part of a daily medical check. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, heart sounds are detected using a heart-sound microphone which is usually directly worn on skin of a prescribed portion of the chest, e.g., right above the heart. A heart-sound signal provided by the heart-sound microphone worn on the chest has a great signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Thus, the heart-sound signal which is filtered by a standardized filter can directly be used to determine a reference point for making diagnosis or determining pulse-wave propagation velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, when the heart-sound microphone is used to detect heart sounds, the subject needs to take off the cloth and thereby expose the chest. Thus, it is considerably cumbersome to detect heart sounds using the heart-sound microphone. In particular, when pulse-wave propagation velocity is measured, at home, as part of a daily medical check, it is desirable to detect heart sounds in an easier manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In this background, it has been proposed to provide a heart-sound detecting apparatus which detects a heart sound at a position distant from the chest of a living subject, based on the fact that the heart sound is transmitted from the heart to that position. This apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application claming priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-030879. This apparatus includes a pressure-pulse-wave sensor which is worn on an upper arm of a subject and extracts a heart-sound component from a pressure-pulse-wave signal supplied from the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the magnitude of the heart-sound component contained in the pressure-pulse-wave signal or physical signal detected from the upper arm distant from the chest, is weak, and the magnitude of the other signal components, such as physical sounds occurring to the upper arm, external noise, or artifact, is strong. Therefore, in many cases, the signal filtered by the conventional, standardized filter may not be used to determine one or more reference points which are needed to make diagnosis or determine pulse-wave propagation velocity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a heart-sound detecting apparatus which can accurately determine a heart-sound component which is contained in a physical signal, even if the magnitude of the heart-sound component may be weak relative to the magnitude of the physical signal as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The Inventors have intensively studied about how to achieve the above-indicated object, and obtained the following finding: Usually, a heart-sound signal supplied by a heart-sound microphone is filtered by a filter having a considerably large frequency range, because there are great differences among respective heart-sound signals obtained from individual subjects. That is, the respective heart sounds of individual subjects may have largely different frequency ranges and/or waveforms. Hence, the Inventors have found that if a heart-sound frequency range and/or a heart-sound waveform of each individual subject are/is determined, in advance, as heart-sound characteristic information, a heart-sound component can be accurately determined, based on the heart-sound characteristic information, from a physical signal actually detected from the each subject, even if the magnitude of the heart-sound component may be weak relative to that of the physical signal as a whole. The present invention has been developed based on this finding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The above object has been achieved by the present invention. According to a first feature of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for detecting a heart sound of a living subject, comprising a memory device which stores heart-sound characteristic information which is characteristic of a heart sound of the subject; a heart-sound sensor which is adapted to be worn on a body portion of the subject that is distant from a chest of the subject and which detects, from the body portion, a physical signal containing a heart-sound component and supplies the physical signal; and a heart-sound determining means for determining, based on the heart-sound characteristic information stored in the memory device, the heart-sound component contained in the physical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to this feature, the memory device stores heart sound characteristic information which is characteristic of a heart sound of the living subject, and the heart-sound determining means determines, based on the heart-sound characteristic information characteristic of the heart sound, the heart-sound component contained in the physical signal supplied by the heart-sound sensor. Therefore, even if the magnitude of the heart-sound component may be weak relative to that of the physical signal as a whole, the present apparatus can accurately determine the heart-sound component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to a second feature of the present invention, the heart-sound characteristic information comprises a heart-sound frequency range consisting of a plurality of frequencies which are predetermined by subjecting, to a frequency analysis, the heart sound detected in advance from the chest of the subject, and the heart-sound determining means extracts, from the physical signal, the heart-sound component having the plurality of frequencies of the heart-sound frequency range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to this feature, the memory device stores the heart-sound frequency range which is predetermined based on the heart sound detected in advance from the chest of the subject and which is characteristic of the subject, and the heart-sound determining means extracts, from the physical signal supplied by the heart-sound sensor, the heart-sound component having the frequencies of the heart-sound frequency range. Thus, even if the magnitude of the heart-sound component may be weak relative to that of the physical signal as a whole, the present apparatus can accurately extract the heart-sound component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to a third feature of the present invention, the heart-sound characteristic information comprises a first portion of the heart sound detected in advance from the chest of the subject, the first portion being detected during a predetermined time interval, and the heart-sound determining means determines, as the heart-sound component, a second portion of the physical signal supplied by the heart-sound sensor, the second portion having a length corresponding to the predetermined time interval and having a waveform best approximating a waveform of the first portion of the heart sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to this feature, the memory device stores, as the heart-sound characteristic information characteristic of the subject, a portion of the heart sound which is detected in advance from the chest of the subject and which has a great signal-to-noise ratio. Since the heart-sound determining means determines, as the heart-sound component, a portion of the physical signal detected by the heart-sound sensor that has a length corresponding to the predetermined time interval and has a waveform best approximating a waveform of the portion of the heart-sound signal stored in the memory device, the present apparatus can accurately determine the heart-sound component from the physical signal even if the magnitude of the heart-sound component contained in the physical signal may be weak. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to a fourth feature of the present invention, the heart-sound characteristic information comprises a first portion of the heart sound detected in advance from the chest of the subject, the first portion having a plurality of frequencies of a heart-sound frequency range which is predetermined based on a frequency-time analyzed signal of the heart sound, and being detected during a predetermined time interval, and the heart-sound determining means determines, as the heart-sound component, a second portion of the physical signal supplied by the heart-sound sensor, the second portion having the plurality of frequencies of the heart-sound frequency range, having a length corresponding to the predetermined time interval, and having a waveform best approximating a waveform of the first portion of the heart sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to this feature, the memory device stores a portion of the heart sound, detected in advance from the chest of the subject, that has the frequencies of a heart-sound frequency range which is predetermined based on a frequency-time analyzed signal of the heart sound, and is detected during a predetermined time interval, and the heart-sound determining means determines, as the heart-sound component, a portion of the physical signal, supplied by the heart-sound sensor, that has the frequencies of the heart-sound frequency range, has a length corresponding to the predetermined time interval, and has a waveform best approximating a waveform of the stored portion of the heart sound. Thus, the present apparatus can accurately determine the heart-sound component from the physical signal.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, there will be described a preferred embodiment of the present invention in detail by reference to the accompanying drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a diagrammatic view showing a construction of a pulse-wave-propagation-velocity measuring apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> functioning as a heart-sound detecting apparatus, to which the present invention is applied. The present apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also functions as a blood-pressure measuring apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> designates an inflatable cuff which is adapted to be wound around a right upper arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a patient. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a development view of the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a belt-like cover bag <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is formed of a non-stretchable and considerably rigid cloth and has substantially the same length as that of a common inflatable cuff which is used to measure a blood pressure of an upper arm of a patient. However, a width of the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is longer than that of the common cuff by a length corresponding to a width of a small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the cover bag <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, there are provided a large cuff <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> each of which has substantially the same length (e.g., 24 cm) as that of a circumferential length of the upper arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is formed of rubber. The large cuff <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has substantially the same width as that of a rubber bag employed in the common cuff. The width of the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is smaller than that of the large cuff <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is, for example, 2 cm. The large cuff <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided such that respective one long sides thereof are adjacent to each other. In a state in which the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is wound around the upper arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned at a distal-side end of the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The large cuff <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are connected to respective pipings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for supplying pressurized air thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A flexible support plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which has substantially the same width as that of the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed to an inner surface of the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that contacts the upper arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is wound around the same <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. More specifically described, the support plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is fixed to a portion of the inner surface of the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so that when the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is wound around the upper arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the support plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is pressed by the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The support plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> supports four pressure-pulse-wave sensors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> such that the four sensors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are arranged along a straight line in a lengthwise direction of the plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Between each pair of adjacent sensors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, there is provided a considerably small space of 0.9 mm length. Each pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> produces a pressure-pulse-wave signal SM containing not only a brachial-artery-pulse-wave component but also a heart-sound component. Thus, each pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> also functions as a heart-sound sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a plan view of one of the four pressure-pulse-wave sensors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a press surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is defined by a semiconductor chip such as monocrystalline silicon and has a length of about 13 mm in a lengthwise direction of the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (i.e., in a left-right direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>).

The high-pass filter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extracts, from the pressure signal SP<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, an alternating component having frequencies not lower than 0.8 Hz, and supplies the thus extracted alternating-component signal to a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> via an amplifier, not shown. The low-pass filter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extracts, from the alternating-component signal supplied from the high-pass filter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an alternating component having frequencies not higher than 10.8 Hz.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Since the waveform represented by the modified wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) has a width scaled by the parameter a along the time axis t, a parameter, 1/a, indicates frequency; and since the waveform represented by the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) is translated by the parameter b along the time axis t, the parameter b indicates time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> are graphs for explaining what is meant by the wavelet transform defined by the above expression (1). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows that a wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) in which appropriate parameters a, b have been selected substantially approximates a portion of a certain function g(t); and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows that the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) does not approximates any portions of a certain function h(t). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> shows the product of the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) and the function g(t) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows the product of the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) and the function h(t) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. In the case, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, in which the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) substantially approximates a portion of the function g(t), the plus or minus sign of the product of the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) and the function g(t) does not change as the time t elapses. Therefore, a great value is obtained by integrating the product function. On the other hand, in the case, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, in which the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) does not approximate any portions of the function h(t), the plus and minus sign of the product of the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) and the function h(t) frequently changes from plus to minus and from minus to plus as the time t elapses. Therefore, only a small value is obtained by integrating the product function. Thus, the above-indicated expression (1) provides a great value when the parameters a, b are appropriately selected so that the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) approximates a portion of the function f(t) representing the heart-sound signal SH; and the expression (1) provides a small value when the wavelet function &PSgr;((t&minus;b)/a) does not approximate any portions of the function f(t). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the above-indicated expression (1), the scale parameter a corresponding to the frequency f and the translate parameter b corresponding to the time t are gradually changed and, each time at least one of the two parameters a, b is changed, an integral value is obtained from the wavelet transform, i.e., expression (1). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows a waveform of the heart-sound signal SH supplied from the heat-sound microphone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows a three-dimensional graph (i.e., a contour map) that is obtained by analyzing the waveform of the heart-sound signal SH shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, with respect to time, frequency, and signal magnitude, by utilizing the wavelet transform, i.e., expression (1). In the contour map, three contour lines represent three integral values, i.e., <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The fast Fourier transform transforms a signal (i.e., a two-dimensional signal with respect to time and signal magnitude) that is obtained from each of prescribed time intervals, into a different sort of two-dimensional signal with respect to frequency and signal magnitude. Therefore, if the function f(t) is subjected to the fast Fourier transform each time the time t is moved from one time interval to the next time interval, the function f(t) is transformed into a three-dimensional signal with respect to time, frequency, and signal magnitude, like the contour map obtained by the wavelet transform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The heart-sound-frequency-range determining means <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> determines, based on the three-dimensional graph obtained by the time-frequency analyzing means <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, a frequency range RF of the heart sounds represented by the heart-sound signal SH supplied from the microphone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and stores the thus determined heart-sound frequency range RF in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The heart-sound frequency range RF may be one which includes respective frequencies of all heart sounds including first and second heart sounds I, II. However, in the present embodiment, the heart-sound-frequency-range determining means <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> determines a frequency range including frequencies of a second heart sound II as part of the heart sounds. For example, regarding the three-dimensional graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the heart-sound-frequency-range determining means <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> determines, as the heart-sound frequency range RF, a range of frequencies which correspond to respective times when the second heart sound II, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, occur, and which correspond to respective signal magnitudes not smaller than a reference value (e.g., <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows the thus determined heart-sound frequency range RF. This heart-sound frequency range RF is characteristic of the subject. </paragraph>

In addition, the reference-waveform determining means <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> determines a prescribed periodic point on the thus determined reference waveform, as a reference point, and stores the thus determined reference waveform and point in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The reference waveform is also characteristic of the subject. The above-indicated time interval is so prescribed as to include a time or a time interval which is necessary for making a diagnosis. Since, in the present apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a pulse-wave-propagation-velocity determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, described later, needs a starting point of a second heart sound II, the prescribed time interval includes the starting point of second heart sound II, and the prescribed periodic point means the starting point of second heart sound II. </paragraph>

Respective amplitudes of pressure-pulse-wave signals SM detected by nearer pressure-sensing elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the brachial artery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are greater than those detected by remoter elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from the artery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A filtering means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as a first heart-sound determining means subjects the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM supplied from the optimum element A, to a digital filter which allows, based on the heart-sound frequency range RF stored in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, only a signal component having frequencies falling in the frequency range RF to pass therethrough. Thus, the filtering means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extracts, from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM, only the signal component having the frequencies falling in the frequency range of the second heart sound II whose level is considerably low in the signal SM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> determines a time interval in which a waveform of the signal component extracted by the filtering means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> best approximates the reference waveform stored in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Since the reference waveform is determined based on the second heart sound II, a portion of the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM that occurs in the time interval determined by the second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> corresponds to the second heart sound II. In addition, in a state in which the waveform of the signal component extracted by the filtering means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> best approximates the reference waveform, the second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> determines a time point corresponding to the starting point of the second heart sound II as the reference waveform. This time point indicates a time when the starting point of second heart sound II contained in the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM occurs. The method in which the second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> determines the time interval in which the waveform of the signal component extracted by the filtering means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> best approximates the reference waveform, may be to obtain a cross-correlation function with respect to the waveform of the signal component extracted by the filtering means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the reference waveform and determine, as the above-indicated time interval, a time interval corresponding to the reference waveform in a state in which the cross-correlation function takes a maximal value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A noise removing means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> subjects the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM supplied from the optimum element A, to a digital filter, and thereby removes noise from the signal SM, so as to extract the pressure pulse wave BAP produced when the brachial artery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> pulsates. Since the pressure pulse wave BAP is a heartbeat-synchronous wave, the noise removing means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> removes, from the signal SM, a component having frequencies not lower than 50 Hz. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a pressure pulse wave BAP which is freed of noise by the noise removing means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The pulse-wave-propagation-velocity determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> determines a timing when the rising point of second heart sound II determined by the second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is detected, a timing when a notch of the pressure pulse wave BAP that corresponds to the second heart sound II is detected, and determines a time difference between the two timings. The pressure pulse wave BAP has been freed of noise by the noise removing means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The thus determined time difference is determined as a pulse-wave propagation time DT (sec) that is needed for the pressure pulse wave BAP to propagate from the aortic valve of the heart to a portion of the brachial artery <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that is located right below the pressure-pulse-wave sensors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The pulse-wave-propagation-velocity determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> determines, based on the thus determined pulse-wave propagation time DT, a pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV (m/sec), according to the following expression (2), pre-stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>PWV&equals;L/DT</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The thus determined pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV is displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In the above expression (1), L is a length of an artery from an initial end of the aorta to a portion thereof located right below the optimum element A, and is obtained in advance by experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> are flow charts representing respective control programs according to which the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is operated. The flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> represents a heart-sound-characteristic-information obtaining routine, and the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> represents a pulse-wave-propagation-velocity determining routine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> First, there will be described the heart-sound-characteristic-information obtaining routine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. This routine is carried out before the routine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is carried out. When the routine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is carried out, it is needed to wear the heart-sound mirophone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> on the chest of a patient, but it is not needed to wear the cuff <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the upper arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> First, at Step SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (hereinafter, &ldquo;Step&rdquo; is omitted), the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> resets a number counted by a timer t, to zero. Next, at SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> reads in the heart-sound signal SH supplied from the heart-sound microphone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. At SA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> adds one to the number counted by the timer t and, at SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> judges whether a time represented by the number counted by the timer t has exceeded a prescribed read-in time T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>corresponding to an average pulse period, i.e., an inverse of an average pulse rate. While negative judgments are made at SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, Steps SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are repeated to continue reading in the heart-sound signal SH. Since the heart-sound signal SH is supplied from the heart-sound microphone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> worn on the chest, the signal SH has a greater signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio than that of the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM supplied from each pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> worn on the upper arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The S/N ratio of the signal SM is defined as a ratio of the heart-sound component thereof to the remaining components thereof as noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, if a positive judgment is made at SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the control proceeds with Steps SA<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> corresponding to the heart-sound-characteristic-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. At SA<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines, based on the heart-sound signal SH read in while Steps SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are repeated, a starting point and an ending point of a second heart sound II, using a known technique (so-called &ldquo;smoothing energy curve&rdquo;) which is widely employed to determine characteristic points of heart sounds. The respective positions of the starting and ending points and the respective times of detection of the starting and ending points are stored in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Next, the control goes to SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> corresponding to the time-frequency analyzing means <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. At SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the heart-sound signal SH read in while Steps SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are repeated is subjected to the wavelet transform. Thus, a time-frequency analyzed signal is obtained as a contour map as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Then, the control goes to SA<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> corresponding to the heart-sound-frequency-range determining means <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. At SA<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines, as a heart-sound frequency range RF characteristic of a second heart sound II of the subject, a range of respective frequencies which correspond to respective times between the starting and ending points, determined at SA<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, on the time-frequency analyzed signal, obtained at SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and which correspond to respective signal magnitudes not smaller than a reference value. The thus determined heart-sound frequency range RF is stored in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Next, the control goes to SA<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> corresponding to the reference-waveform determining means <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. At SA<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extracts, from a portion of the heart-sound signal SH, obtained at Steps SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, that occurs between the starting and ending points of the second heart sound II, determined at SA<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a signal component having the frequencies of the heart-sound frequency range RF determined at SA<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and determines a waveform of the thus extracted component, as a reference waveform. This reference waveform is stored in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Though the heart-sound signal SH read in at SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a considerably great SIN ratio, the signal component extracted at SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is obtained by removing noise from the portion of the signal SH that occurs between the starting and ending points of second heart sound II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, there will be described the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity determining routine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. This routine is carried out in a state in which the upper arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not pressed by the large cuff <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, first, at Step SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to the small-cuff-pressure control means <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> starts the air pump <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and operates the pressure control valve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, so that the pressing pressure P<highlight><subscript>K2 </subscript></highlight>of the small cuff <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is kept at a considerably low pressure of, e.g., 40 mmHg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Next, at SB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a number counted by a timer t is replaced with &ldquo;0&rdquo;, so that the timer t is reset to zero and, at SB<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> outputs the switch signal SC to switch the multiplexer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the EPROM <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> at a period sufficiently shorter than an average pulse period. Then, at SB<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> reads in the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM supplied from the multiplexer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Next, at SB<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> adds one to the number counted by the timer t and, at SB<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> judges whether a time indicated by the number counted by the timer t has exceeded a prescribed read-in period T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Like the read-in time T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, the read-in period T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may be equal to an average pulse period, i.e., a length of one average heartbeat-synchronous pulse. Each time one switch signal SC is supplied to the multiplexer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at SB<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, one of the respective pressure-pulse-wave signals SM detected by the sixty pressure-sensing elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is supplied from the multiplexer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. While Steps SB<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to SB<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are repeated sixty times, all the signals SM detected by the sixty elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are supplied from the multiplexer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Next, the control goes to SB<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and SB<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> corresponding to the optimum-element selecting means <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. First, at SB<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines respective amplitudes of the respective pressure-pulse-wave signals SM which have been read in while Steps SB<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are repeated. At S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines the greatest one of the respective amplitudes determined at SB<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and determines, as the optimum element A, one of the pressure-sensing elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that provides the greatest amplitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Next, the control goes to SB<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> corresponding to the filtering means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. At SB<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extracts, from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM supplied from the optimum element A selected at SB<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a signal component having frequencies falling in the heart-sound frequency range RF stored at SA<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The signal component extracted from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM has the frequencies of the second heart sound II of the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the control goes to Steps SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>O and SB<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponding to the second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. At SB<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines a cross-correlation function with respect to the waveform of the signal component extracted at SB<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the reference waveform stored at SA<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. At SB<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines a position of the reference waveform relative to the waveform extracted at SB<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, in a state in which the cross-correlation function takes a maximal value, and determines, as a time of occurrence of a starting point of the second heart sound II as the extracted waveform, a time corresponding to a position of the starting point of the second heart sound II on the extracted waveform that corresponds to the starting point of the second heart sound II determined and stored at SA<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Next, the control goes to SB<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> corresponding to the noise removing means <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. More specifically described, at S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> subjects the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM detected by the optimum element A, to a digital filter, so as to remove a signal component having frequencies not lower than 50 Hz. Thus, the pressure pulse wave BAP is extracted from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM. Next, at SB<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines, based on the pressure pulse wave BAP extracted at SB<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a time of occurrence of a notch (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) to the pressure pulse wave BAP that corresponds to the starting point of second heart sound II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Then, the control goes to Steps SB<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, SB<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and SB<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> corresponding to the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. At SB<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines a pulse-wave propagation time DT between the time of occurrence of the starting point of the second heart sound II determined at SB<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the time of occurrence of the notch of the pressure pulse wave BAP determined at SB<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Next, at SB<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines a pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV by replacing the parameter DT of the expression (2) with the time difference DT determined at SB<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Next, at SB<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the thus determined pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV is displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> stores the two pieces of heart-sound characteristic information which is characteristic of the heart-sound signal SH of the living subject, i.e., the heart-sound frequency range RF and the reference waveform and, at Steps SB<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and SB<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (the second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), the starting point of the second heart sound II is determined, based on the reference waveform characteristic of the subject, on the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM supplied from the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thus, even if the magnitude of the heart-sound component is weak relative to that of the signal SM as a whole, the starting point of second heart sound II can be determined with accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> More specifically described, in the illustrated embodiment, the heart-sound frequency range RF characteristic of the subject, determined based on the heart-sound signal SH obtained in advance from the chest of the subject, is stored in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> at SA<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>; and the component having the frequencies falling in the heart-sound frequency range RF is extracted from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM supplied from the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, at SB<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (the filtering means, i.e., the first heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). Since the reference waveform stored in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, i.e., the second-heart-sound-II component from its starting point to its ending point is one which has been measured from the chest of the subject, the component has a great SIN ratio. Yet, the component is characteristic of the subject. Moreover, at Steps SB<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and SB<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (the second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), a waveform of a portion of the signal extracted at SB<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that best approximates the reference waveform is determined as the second heart sound II. Thus, an accurate heart-sound signal can be obtained from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in its preferred embodiment by reference to the drawings, it is to be understood that the invention may otherwise be embodied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> For example, in the illustrated apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> stores the heart-sound characteristic information which is obtained from the heart-sound signal SH produced by the heart-sound microphone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. However, in the case where the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is externally accessible to delete the information stored therein and store new information therein, it is possible to employ a separate device which measures a heart sound of a living subject and obtains heart-sound characteristic information from the measured heart sound, and store the thus obtained heart-sound characteristic information in the memory device <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In the latter case, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may not employ the heart-sound microphone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the illustrated apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the heart-sound signal SH is subjected to the time-frequency analysis, and the thus obtained time-frequency-analyzed signal is used to determine the heart-sound frequency range RF and the reference waveform. The filtering means (the first heart-sound determining means) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extracts, from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM, the component having the frequencies falling in the heart-sound frequency rage RF, and the second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> determines, as a second heart sound II, a portion of the extracted signal that best approximates the reference waveform. However, either one of the first and second heart-sound determining means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be omitted. More specifically described, since the component that is extracted from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM and has the frequencies falling in the heart-sound frequency range RF is a sort of heart-sound signal extracted from a physical signal, the second means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be omitted. Alternatively, the filtering means <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may not be employed to extract, from the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM, the component having the frequencies falling in the heart-sound frequency rage RF, and the second means <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be adapted to directly compare the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM with the reference waveform and determine, as a second heart sound II, a portion of the signal SM that best approximates the reference waveform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied with other changes, improvements and modifications that may occur to a person skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
