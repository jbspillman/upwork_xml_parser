<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a midsole structure of an athletic shoe, and more particularly, a midsole assembly having a corrugated sheet therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A sole for an athletic shoe used in various sports includes a midsole formed of a soft elastic material to secure cushioning properties and an outsole fitted to the bottom surface of the midsole and directly contacting the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Not only cushioning properties but also running stability is required as an athletic shoe. That is, there is a need to prevent over-pronation or over-supination that causes an excessive lateral or transverse deformation of a shoe sole after striking onto the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As shown in Japanese utility model application publication No. 61-6804 and Japanese patent application laying-open publication No. 11-203, Mizuno Corporation proposed a midsole assembly having a corrugated sheet therein to prevent such an excessive lateral or transverse deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the midsole assembly described in the above-mentioned publications, a corrugated sheet having a wavy corrugation is disposed in a heel portion of a midsole. Therefore, at the time of striking onto the ground, a resistance force occurs to restrain lateral or transverse deformation of the heel portion of the midsole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, by inserting a corrugated sheet into a midsole, compressive hardness or hardness to deformation against a vertical compressive force of the whole midsole becomes higher, and the midsole tends to be less deformed in the transverse and vertical directions. Therefore, by inserting a corrugated sheet, necessary cushioning properties on landing are not necessary achieved at portions that require cushioning properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when a relatively lower elastic material is used as a corrugated sheet, cushioning properties are achieved to some extent on landing but lateral deformation after landing may not be fully restrained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a midsole structure of an athletic shoe that can satisfy both stability and cushioning properties. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A midsole structure of an athletic shoe according to a first invention includes a midsole formed of a soft elastic material and extending from a heel region to a forefoot region of a shoe, and a corrugated sheet disposed at a heel portion and a midfoot portion of the midsole. And flexural rigidity of a medial portion of the corrugated sheet is different from that of a lateral portion of the corrugated sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Generally, as flexural rigidity of a corrugated sheet increases, cushioning properties of a midsole on landing decreases but stability of the midsole improves. In contrast, as flexural rigidity of a corrugated sheet decreases, stability of the midsole decreases but cushioning properties of a midsole on landing improves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, by decreasing flexural rigidity of a heel portion of a corrugated sheet at a medial portion (or a lateral portion) that requires cushioning properties on landing, in other words, by increasing flexural rigidity of a heel portion of a corrugated sheet at a lateral portion (or a medial portion) that requires stability after landing, cushioning properties of the midsole on landing can be secured and stability of the midsole after landing can be acquired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this case, when flexural rigidity of the medial portion of the corrugated sheet is made higher than that of the lateral portion of the corrugated sheet, in an athletic shoe such as a running shoe that strikes onto the ground more often from the lateral side, cushioning properties on landing is secured by the lateral portion of the corrugated sheet having a relatively lower flexural rigidity, and running stability after landing is secured by the medial portion of the corrugated sheet having a relatively higher flexural rigidity, thereby preventing over-pronation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In contrast, when flexural rigidity of the lateral portion of the corrugated sheet is made higher than that of the medial portion of the corrugated sheet, in an athletic shoe such as an indoor sports shoe or a tennis shoe that strikes onto the ground more often from the medial side, cushioning properties on landing is secured by the medial portion of the corrugated sheet having a relatively lower flexural rigidity, and running stability after landing is secured by the lateral portion of the corrugated sheet having a relatively higher flexural rigidity, thereby preventing over-supination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a boundary line between the medial side portion and the lateral side portion of the corrugated sheet crosses a load transfer curve for a heel striker at the midfoot portion of the midsole. The heel striker tends to strike onto the ground from a heel region of a shoe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Here, when the boundary line between the medial and lateral sides of the corrugated sheet is disposed on the load transfer curve, flexural rigidity of the midsole will change abruptly on opposite sides of the load transfer curve. Thus, the way of deformation of the midsole will abruptly change on opposite sides of the load transfer curve at the time of load transfer, which impedes running stability and makes a shoe wearer feel unpleasant. In contrast, when the boundary line crosses the load transfer curve, the way of deformation of the midsole will not abruptly change on opposite sides of the load transfer curve at the time of load transfer. Thus, running stability can be secured, and cushioning properties and stability can be adjusted according to the actual landing condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The boundary line between the medial and lateral sides of the corrugated sheet may cross a load transfer curve for a heel striker in zigzag. In this case, since the midsole comes to deform along the load transfer curve further smoothly, a smooth landing will be possible at the time of striking onto the ground. In addition, deflections of the boundary line from the load transfer curve may be equal or unequal on opposite sides of the load transfer curve.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In order to relatively lower the flexural rigidity of the medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the flexural rigidity of the lateral sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be relatively increased. For example, fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) sheet may be attached to the lateral sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>This fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) sheet comprises reinforcement fiber and matrix resin. Reinforcement fiber may be carbon fiber, aramid fiber, glass fiber, kevler fiber or the like. Matrix resin may be thermoplastic or thermosetting resin.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As is clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the outsole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided at the bottom surface of the lower midsole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> disposed at the heel portion H of the upper midsole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The outsole <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided at the medial side and a toe portion of the forefoot portion H of the upper midsole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a corrugated sheet of the midsole structure of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an arrow-marked curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>indicates a load transfer curve of a runner or a heel striker who strikes onto the ground from a shoe heel portion. The edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>forms a boundary line between the lateral sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>at the midfoot portion M and extends generally in zigzag. Also, the boundary line, or the edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>has a generally equal deflection on opposite sides from the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. That is, deflections &dgr; of the medial and lateral sides are nearly equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as mentioned above, the flexural rigidity of the lateral sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is made higher than that of the medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>that is, the flexural rigidity of the lateral portion of the heel portion and the midfoot portion of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is higher than that of the medial portion thereof. Thus, in athletic shoes such as an indoor sports shoe, tennis shoe or the like, which strikes onto the ground more frequently from the medial side, cushioning properties can be secured at the medial portion at the time of landing and stability can be achieved at the lateral portion after landing, thereby preventing over-supination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition, if the boundary line between the medial sheet portion and the lateral sheet portion of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, e.g. the edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in this embodiment, extends on and along the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, the flexural rigidity of the midsole will change abruptly on opposite sides of the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. Thus, the way of deformation of the midsole will change abruptly when a load crosses the boundary line during load transfer, which impedes running stability and makes a shoe wearer feel uncomfortable. In contrast, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the boundary line crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, during load transfer along the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, the way of deformation of the midsole will not change abruptly on opposite sides of the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. Thus, running stability is achieved and cushioning properties and stability suitable for actual landing condition can be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in this case, since the boundary line between the medial and lateral sheet portions of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>in zigzag, the midsole comes to deform more smoothly along the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, thereby enabling a smooth landing at the time of striking onto the ground. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Alternative Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, a midsole structure of an alternative embodiment of the present invention will be explained using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, each corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed of a sheet body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; that covers nearly entire region of a heel portion H and a midfoot portion M of an upper midsole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; that covers a medial portion of the heel portion H and the midfoot portion M of the upper midsole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the entire portion thereof is attached to the sheet body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;. That is, in this case, the medial portion extending from the heel portion to the midfoot portion of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a double sheet structure where two pieces of corrugated sheets are overlapped. A lower midsole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extends from the heel portion H to the forefoot portion F through the midfoot portion M of the upper midsole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An outsole <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extending along the entire length of a shoe is fitted to the bottom surface of the lower midsole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; may be formed of material having a relatively higher or lower flexural rigidity, or having the same flexural rigidity. In any case, since the medial portion of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a double sheet structure with the sheet body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, the flexural rigidity of the medial portion is higher than that of the lateral portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, an arrow-marked line T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>indicates a load transfer curve of a heel striker or runner who strikes onto the ground from a shoe heel portion. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> boundary line between the sheet body <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; and the medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;, or an edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>of the medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>at the midfoot portion M and extends generally in zigzag. A deflection &dgr; of the boundary line or the edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is made nearly equal on opposite sides of the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, as above-mentioned, the flexural rigidity of the medial side at the heel and midfoot portions of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is higher than that of the lateral side. Thus, in the case of especially, running shoes that strikes onto the ground from the heel lateral portion, cushioning properties on landing can be secured at the lateral side and stability after landing can be achieved at the medial side, thereby preventing over-pronation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Also, the boundary line between the medial and lateral sheet portions of the corrugated sheet, or an edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the medial sheet portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. Thus, the way of deformation of the midsole will not change abruptly on opposite sides of the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>at the time of load transfer along the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. As a result, running stability can be secured, and cushioning properties and stability comes to be adjusted according to the actual landing condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in this case, since the boundary line between the medial and lateral sheet portions of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>in zigzag, the midsole comes to deform still more smoothly along the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, thereby enabling a smooth landing at the time of striking onto the ground. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Variants of Boundary Line </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</cross-reference>, the boundary line between the medial and lateral sheet portions of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>mainly at the midfoot portion M, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a first variant of a boundary line. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> boundary line B between the medial sheet S<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>and the lateral sheet S<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>in zigzag not only at a midfoot portion M but also at a heel portion H. Also, deflections of the boundary line B on opposite sides of the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>are not equal to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a second variant of a boundary line. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, like reference symbols indicate identical or functionally similar elements. In this case, a boundary line B between a medial sheet S<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>and a lateral sheet S<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>crosses the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>in zigzag at the midfoot portion M and the heel portion H, but deflections of the boundary line B are nearly equal on opposite sides of the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C illustrate a third variant of a boundary line. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C, like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Generally, in forming a corrugated contact face onto a midsole, a heat-press method of pressing a midsole in a heated condition with a mold having a corrugated surface is often utilized. In the case of such a forming method, crest portions of a wavy corrugation of the midsole have relatively higher density than trough portions of the wavy corrugation of the midsole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 12C</cross-reference>, in a midsole structure having an upper midsole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, lower midsole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and corrugated sheets <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>crest portions of a wavy corrugation of the lower midsole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have a relatively higher density and compressive hardness and are hard to deform compressively. Trough portions of a wavy corrugation of the lower midsole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have a relatively lower density and compressive hardness and are easy to deform compressively. That is, inside the lower midsole <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, relatively harder regions and softer regions are disposed alternately and repetitively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In this case, by disposing the edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a lower rigidity away from the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>toward the lateral side (or downwardly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>) on and around crest lines L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a wavy corrugation, a portion having a relatively lower flexural rigidity in the corrugated sheet is disposed at a wider regions on and around the crest lines L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the wavy configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, by disposing the edge portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>of the corrugated sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a lower rigidity away from the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>toward the medial side (or upwardly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>) on and around crest lines L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a wavy corrugation, a portion having a relatively higher flexural rigidity in the corrugated sheet is disposed at a wider regions on and around the crest lines L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the wavy configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In such a way, flexural rigidity of the corrugated sheet will not change abruptly on opposite sides of the load transfer curve T<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. Thus, the way of deformation of the whole midsole structure can be adjusted according to the compressive hardness of the midsole, thereby making a further smooth landing possible at the time of striking onto the ground. </paragraph>
