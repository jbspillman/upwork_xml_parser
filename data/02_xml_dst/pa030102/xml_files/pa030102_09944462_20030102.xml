<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a technology on use of a storage device (such as a disk array system, a hard disk, a tape library system or an optical disk library unit) in an information processing system, and more particularly to the technology on the use of a plurality of storage devices having respective characteristics in a plurality of controllers (computers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As a technology arranged so that a plurality of computers (controllers) may share a storage device, today, a storage area network is widely used. Before the storage area network, it is not considered that the file system software running in the computer system is arranged so that a plurality of computers may share one storage device. In a case that such file system software is shared in the storage area network environment, the data (information) recorded in the storage device may be lost. U.S. Pat. No. 5,950,203 describes the technology of overcoming this shortcoming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The foregoing prior art, however, discloses the technology on how a plurality of computers may share the storage device, while it does not disclose the way of using the storage system if the storage devices have respective attributes (performance, reliability, conservation, cost per one capacity unit, and so forth). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In this respect, the white paper of Tivoli Systems Inc. &ldquo;Vision, Tivoli Storage Management Solutions for the Information Grid&rdquo; introduces the technology on storage of data as using the storage devices with their respective attributes in a storage area network. Even this white paper, however, does not disclose the method of managing the attributes of the storage devices, the method of managing data in the location management unit, the method of billing a user for the storage of data, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, there exists a business called a Storage Service Provider (SSP). The SSP provides a storage fitted for each customer&apos;s request as an outsourcing. By entrusting the management of the storage onto the SSP, the customer enables to reduce the cost on preserving and managing the storage. The SSP needs to not only manage the storage volume but also respond to the performance, the reliability, the cost and the endurance to failure requested by each customer. Further, the SSP itself needs to keep the performance and the reliability as well as reduce the cost on preserving and managing the storage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of preserving data by considering an attribute (performance or cost), an operation ratio, and a access frequency of data in a storage area network composing a plurality of storages having respective attributes, the method implemented by a business aspect such as a storage service provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In carrying out the foregoing object, the information processing system according to the present invention includes a location management unit for managing a location of data stored in a storage device (that will be basically referred simply to as a storage), an information duplication unit for duplicating data from one storage to another, and an attribute preservation unit for preserving attribute information for representing an attribute of each storage. This attribute preservation unit may be provided in each storage. Based on the attribute information preserved in this attribute preservation unit, the location management unit performs location management for writing and reading data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, the location management unit preserves two or more pieces of location information of data corresponding to a file name (data identifier for indicting where the information is located) given from a computer. This makes it possible to preserve a plurality of data units in different storages with respect to one file name. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, an operation ratio is also provided for measuring an operation ratio of the storage. The location management unit performs the location management of the data to be written, the location management of the written data, and the location management of the data to be read out on the basis of this operation ratio. This operation ratio measurement unit may be provided in each storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the location management unit preserves the access frequency of the data and the control information thereof (rules of data duplication and data movement set by a user) corresponding with the file name given from the computer. The control information may be set on each data unit by the computer. It may be pre-set by the location management unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the location management unit preserves the movement and duplication histories of the data in correspondence with the file name given from the computer. Further, it preserves the price information in the attribute preservation unit. This makes it possible for the location management unit to duplicate and move the data from one storage to another through the use of the data duplication unit, based on the operation ratio of the storage, the access frequency of the data, the control information, or the price information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the location management unit preserves a group ID of the data in correspondence with the file name given from the computer. The location management unit performs the duplication and the movement of the data on the basis of the group ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition, the computer provides a data acceptance unit for accepting data to be transferred from the information duplication unit and a storage for storing the accepted data.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Hereafter, the first embodiment (with no cache) of the invention will be described with reference to the appended drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a system configuration of the first embodiment. The present system includes three computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, three disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, a library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, and a fibre channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. The computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> are connected to the fiber channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> through a fibre channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The fibre channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> operates to set up a path between the components connected to the system or switch the path. The computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> are connected with one another through an Ethernet <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Later than the first embodiment, the second and the third embodiments will be described. The second and the third embodiments have the same configuration as the first embodiment. Hence, those embodiments will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and the data acceptance unit <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> located in the computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and an operation ratio measurement unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> located in the computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> are specific to the system of the second embodiment. Hence, the disk measurement unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is not mentioned with respect to the first embodiment. Likewise, a client <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is specific to the system of the third embodiment. Hence, it is not mentioned in the first and the second embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> network arranged with the fibre channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is generally called SAN (Storage Area Network). A network arranged with the Ethernet <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is generally called LAN (Local Area Network). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, these two networks, the fibre channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the Ethernet <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, are used for arranging the system. The other networks may be used in place of these networks. The function of the Ethernet <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be covered by the fibre channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Of the three computers, the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> provides the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the data and the data duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>, which will be discussed below in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Next, the description will be oriented to the disk array system and the attribute preservation unit. In general, the disk array system includes a plurality of hard disks and is served as a storage device with improved performance and reliability through the effect of the RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks). The performance and reliability of the disk array system substantially depends on the performance and the number of the hard disks composing the disk array system and the RAID level. For example, the level called the RAID0 has a higher performance by distributing the data into a plurality of hard disks. However, if only one of the hard disks composing the RAID0 is failed, all the data may be lost. The level called RAID5 has a higher performance by distributing the data into a plurality of hard disks and provides a higher reliability that even if only one of the hard disks composing the RAID5 is failed, the data may be restored by adding redundant data composed of a parity. The RAID5 is more improved in reliability than the RAID0, while it is lower in performance when writing the data. Moreover, the performances of the RAID0 and RAID5 substantially depend on the number of the hard disks composing the RAID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are composed by the RAID0 and the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is composed by the RAID5. Each disk array system provides the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The attribute preservation units <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> located in the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> serve to preserve the fact that the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are composed of the hard disks through the RAID0, the cost per one unit volume, the number of the hard disks composing the disk array system, and the performance of the hard disk (such as the number of revolutions, the seek time, and the throughput). The attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> located in the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> serves to preserve the fact that the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is composed of the hard disks through the RAIDS, the cost per one unit volume, the number of the hard disks composing the disk array system, and the performance of the hard disk (such as the number of revolutions, the seek time and the throughput). Hence, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> enables to easily grasp the performance and the reliability levels of the disk array system by picking up the attribute data from the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As an implementation of the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, it is preferable to provide a nonvolatile storage located in the disk array system. For example, the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be realized by the memory for storing a device identifier and device data. For picking up the data stored in the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, it is possible to use an INQUIRY command or a MODE SENSE command defined by the SCSI (Small Computer System Interface). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Then, the description will be oriented to the library system and the attribute preservation unit. In this embodiment, the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> includes two DVD-RAM drives <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, four shelves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> that may store mediums, and one conveyance unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for conveying a medium between the drive <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the shelf <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. However, the present invention does not rely on the number of the drives, the number of the shelves, the number of the conveyance units, and so forth located in the library system. Further, the present invention may be composed of two or more library systems. In this embodiment, each of the four shelves <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may store one DVD-RAM medium. The library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> serves to convey the medium specified by the instruction given from the computer from one drive to another, from one drive to a shelf, and from one shelf to another through the effect of the conveyance unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In order to read the data recorded on the medium stored in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, at first, the computer operates to instruct the library system to convey the medium on which the data to be read is recorded from the shelf to the drive. Then, the computer waits for a report on termination of the conveyance from the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and then instructs the drive <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to read the data thereout. As mentioned just above, it takes a conveyance time of the medium by the conveyance unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> plus the time passed until the target data is to be read (that is mainly a spin-up time passed until the medium reaches the readable number of revolutions) to read the target data out of the medium. Assuming that this time is about ten seconds, the difference of the reading time between the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is three digits or more because the time taken to read the target data by the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is several milliseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> provides the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as well. The attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> located in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> preserves the fact that the library system is composed of a DVD-RAM drive, the cost per a unit volume, the conveying time, the number and the type of the drives <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> mounted in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the number, the types and the lives of the mediums, and the performance of the drive (such as the number of revolutions, the seek time, and the throughput). The attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be preferably realized by the nonvolatile storage located in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Next, the description will be oriented to the location management unit and the conversion table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> provides the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. Concretely, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is mounted as software to be executed in the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is served to communicate with the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through a LAN <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The protocol used for the communication is not so much defined. For example, the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) may be used. When the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> accepts a file name from the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the unit <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> operates to lock the file data of the file data if necessary and then report the location of the target data to the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. For this operation, the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> is prepared in which the file names correspond with the location data of the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the composition of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>. The conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> is stored in the memory of the host computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. The conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> provides the fields of a write bit, a read count, control information, two or more location data units, and a file history for one file name. (The group ID will be discussed below.) Each location data includes an effective bit, a storage number, a medium number, a LBA (Logical Block Address), and a data length. In this embodiment, a WWN (World Wide Name) is used for the storage number. The WWN is a number allocated to a fibre channel adapter. In this embodiment, the WWN of the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;201&rdquo;, the WWN of the disk array system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;202&rdquo;, the WWN of the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;203&rdquo;, and the WWN of the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;301&rdquo;. The medium number is effective only if the target storage is the library system. It stores the number of the medium (or the number of the shelf) where the target data is stored. As the LBA is used a logical block address at which the data is stored. The logical block is a minimum unit for storing the data to be managed by the storage. For the disk array, in general, it may store data of 512 bytes. For the DVD-RAM medium, in general, it may store data of 2048 bytes. The logical block address means a number allocated to the logical block. The location data is effective only if the effective bits of the location data are set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, the description will be oriented to the location management unit and an area management table. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> provides an area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows one example of the area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. The area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> is prepared for each disk array system in the case of the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> or for each medium in the case of the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> is a table that indicates which of the logical blocks is used in the system or the medium. In the table, one bit is allocated to one logical block. That is, if the bit corresponding to the logical block is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the data has been already located in the logical block. If it is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, the logical block is not used. The area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> is stored in the memory of the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Then, the description will be oriented to the new writing process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a process of newly writing data in the storage. This process corresponds to the case that the user of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> newly creates a document with an application program like a wordprocessor and saves it at first (<highlight><bold>5000</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> requests the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> to allocate a new area to the data called the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; through the Ethernet 60 (<highlight><bold>5001</bold></highlight>). At this time, the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> adds as numeric values the data length of the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; means the entity data of the file of the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) as well as the control information for indicating how the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is stored. The control information includes &ldquo;fast&rdquo;, &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo;, &ldquo;at long term&rdquo;, &ldquo;inexpensively&rdquo;, &ldquo;for a disaster&rdquo;, &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo;, &ldquo;in parallel&rdquo;, and &ldquo;portably&rdquo;, and so forth. They may be set at a time or exclusively. Herein, it is assumed that the &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; is specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to seek one empty line from the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>5002</bold></highlight>), set the write bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>5003</bold></highlight>), declare the start of the write, and then write the file name (<highlight><bold>5004</bold></highlight>). Herein, it is assumed that the first (&num;1) location data of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> is secured (<highlight><bold>5005</bold></highlight>). Herein, assuming that a sufficient empty area is secured in all the storages (<highlight><bold>5006</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5007</bold></highlight>), the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> enables to obtain the allocable location from all the storages. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> enables to obtain the attribute data of the storage from the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of each storage (<highlight><bold>5008</bold></highlight>). The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to select the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> composed of the RAID5 from the three disk array systems based on the control information &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; pointed by the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>5009</bold></highlight>), change the LBA of the corresponding area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> into the allocated (<highlight><bold>5010</bold></highlight>), and report the location data to the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>5011</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In response to the report of an empty area, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> operates to issue to the disk array <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> the write command for writing the data on a specified empty area (<highlight><bold>5012</bold></highlight>), and then to write the data on the empty area (<highlight><bold>5014</bold></highlight>). The issuance of the write command and the transfer of the data to be written are carried out through the fibre channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> accepts the report on the completion of the write from the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>5015</bold></highlight>), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of the write to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>5016</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In receipt of the report on completion of the write, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the WWN, the LBA and the data length of the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in the corresponding location data of the conversion table <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>, herein, the first location data (<highlight><bold>5017</bold></highlight>) and then to set the effective bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>5018</bold></highlight>). By this operation, it is indicated that the first location data is effective. In this case, since the data is written in the disk array system, it is not necessary to put the value into the medium number. Further, the new creation and the date thereof are written in the file history (<highlight><bold>5019</bold></highlight>). Lastly, the write bit is set to &ldquo;0&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>5020</bold></highlight>) and then the write is completed (<highlight><bold>5021</bold></highlight>). In receipt of the report on completion of the write from the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of the write to the application (<highlight><bold>5022</bold></highlight>). By this report, the save of the new document from the application is completed (<highlight><bold>5023</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the processing step <highlight><bold>5006</bold></highlight> of the flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, if no allocable area is left, the writing process is failed (<highlight><bold>5098</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5099</bold></highlight>). Further, if in the processing step <highlight><bold>5006</bold></highlight> the allocable area is left but in the processing step <highlight><bold>5007</bold></highlight> no area is left in the plurality of storages, the operation goes to the processing step <highlight><bold>5010</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Then, the description will be oriented to the reading process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the process for reading data from the storage in the present system. This process corresponds to the fact that the user of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> reads the previously saved document through the application program like a wordprocessor (<highlight><bold>6000</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> requests the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> to read the data of the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; through the Ethernet <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6001</bold></highlight>). The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to select the row for the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6002</bold></highlight>) and then make sure that the write bit is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>6003</bold></highlight>). If the write bit is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, it means that another application program (that may be an application program of another computer) is using the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;. Hence, the data cannot be read out (<highlight><bold>6098</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6099</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Then, the read count is incremented (by 1) (<highlight><bold>6004</bold></highlight>) and then the location data having the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is reported to the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6007</bold></highlight>). If the location data contains only one data unit for &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;, that location data has to be reported. If two or more location data units for &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; are contained, the most approximate location data to the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (for example, which portion of the data is the fastest reading spot) is selected (<highlight><bold>6006</bold></highlight>). Then, the selected location data unit is reported to the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6007</bold></highlight>). Herein, it is the location data of the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; written in the foregoing new write. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In receipt of the report on the location information (WWN, LBA, data length), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> operates to issue a read command to the disk array system <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6008</bold></highlight>) and then read the data from the disk array system <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6009</bold></highlight>). This issuance of the read command and the transfer of the read data are carried out through the fibre channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> receives the report on completion of reading the data from the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6010</bold></highlight>), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of reading the data to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6011</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In receipt of the report on completion of reading the data, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the final access date and time in the file history (<highlight><bold>6012</bold></highlight>) and then decrement the read count by 1 (<highlight><bold>6013</bold></highlight>). If the read count is 0, it means that none refers to the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;. Unless it is 0, it means that the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is being read out. When the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accepts the report on completion of reading the data from the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>6014</bold></highlight>), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of reading the data to the application program (<highlight><bold>6015</bold></highlight>). This results in completing the operation of reading the document being executed by the application program (<highlight><bold>6016</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Then, the description will be oriented to the change of the control information. The user enables to refer to the set control information or reset it by using the utility prepared on the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Herein, the change of the control information of the pre-written data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is described as an example. When the user requests the utility to reset the control information, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to request the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> to read out the control information. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to read the control information of the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> and then report it to the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In receipt of the control information, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the control information to the utility. Herein, it is assumed that the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> reads the preset control information of &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Then, when the user changes the control information from &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; into &ldquo;inexpensively&rdquo;, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> requests the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> to write the control information. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to change the control information for the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> into &ldquo;inexpensively&rdquo; and then report the completion of the change to the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of the change to the utility and then the change of the control information is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In turn, the description will be oriented to the monitoring and the movement executed by the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> are flowcharts showing the process of monitoring and moving the data to be executed by the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. Herein, the movement of the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> will be described as an example. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> iteratively retrieves the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> at a certain period (<highlight><bold>7000</bold></highlight>). As to the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; whose control information is changed from &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; into &ldquo;inexpensively&rdquo;, the change is found at this periodical cycle (<highlight><bold>7001</bold></highlight>). The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to compare the final access date and time of this data with the current date and time (<highlight><bold>7002</bold></highlight>) for the purpose of checking if a certain period of time (for example, 90 days) is passed (<highlight><bold>7003</bold></highlight>). If a certain time of length is passed, the target data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is moved into the storage with a lower bit cost. In this embodiment, assuming that the preservation cost of the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;10&rdquo;, the preservation cost of the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;15&rdquo;, and the preservation cost of the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to reduce the preservation cost of the data by moving the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; to the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Then, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to make sure that the write bit is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>7004</bold></highlight>) and the read count is &ldquo;0&rdquo; in the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>7005</bold></highlight>), set the write bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>7006</bold></highlight>), refer to the area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, and then retrieve a required area for storing the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the medium of the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the process is executed to obtain the attribute data of the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>7007</bold></highlight>), select the storage with a lower data preservation cost based on the attribute data (<highlight><bold>7008</bold></highlight>), and allocate a new area to the selected storage (<highlight><bold>7009</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> If an empty area where the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is to be stored is found (<highlight><bold>7010</bold></highlight>), the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to change the LBA of the corresponding area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> into the allocated (<highlight><bold>7011</bold></highlight>) and then request the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> to duplicate the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>8000</bold></highlight>). In this embodiment, the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> is provided in the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. In place, it may be located in the fibre channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> or another instrument to be connected with the fibre channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the duplicating process to be executed by the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>. The duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to issue to the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> a conveyance instruction for conveying a medium with an empty area found therein to the drive <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>8002</bold></highlight>). If the target medium is located in the drive, it is not necessary to convey the medium (<highlight><bold>8001</bold></highlight>). The conveyance unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> operates to convey the specified medium form the shelf where it is stored into the specified target drive (<highlight><bold>8003</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8004</bold></highlight>). Then, the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to issue the read command to the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> where the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; has been already written (<highlight><bold>8006</bold></highlight>), read the data from the disk array system (<highlight><bold>8007</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8008</bold></highlight>), issue the write command to the drive to which the conveyed medium is mounted (<highlight><bold>8009</bold></highlight>), and write the data in the medium (<highlight><bold>8010</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8011</bold></highlight>). Upon completion of the write command, the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of duplication to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>8012</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in receipt of the report on completion of the duplication, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the WWN of the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the medium number, the LBA, and the data length in an empty row of the conversion table <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, herein, the second location information thereof (<highlight><bold>7013</bold></highlight>) and then set the effective bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>7014</bold></highlight>). Then, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to nullify the first location information by setting the effective bit of the first location information to &ldquo;0&rdquo; and then put into nonuse the LBA of the area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> corresponding to the first location information. Lastly, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the date and time of the movement in the file history and to set the write bit to &ldquo;0&rdquo;, and the movement is completed (<highlight><bold>7016</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> After the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is moved, for example, if the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> requests to read the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;, the location management unit enables to correctly report the location of the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; stored in the library <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. This is because the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> manages the location information of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> in a unified way. It is not necessary to report the movement of the data from the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> to the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to the computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> If the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; includes the control information &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; in addition to &ldquo;inexpensively&rdquo;, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> retrieves two mediums for an empty area and then moves the data to the mediums. As a result, if one medium is failed so that no data can be read or if one medium is lost, the data can be read, so that the control can be executed &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Then, the description will be oriented to the reference to the data stored in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> are flowcharts showing a process of reading the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; stored in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. For example, it is assumed that after the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is moved from the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> into the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> requests to read the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>15000</bold></highlight>). The file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> requests the local management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> to read the data with the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; through the Ethernet <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>15001</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> selects the row corresponding to the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>15002</bold></highlight>), makes sure that the write bit is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>15003</bold></highlight>), increments the read count, and then starts the reading process (<highlight><bold>15004</bold></highlight>). The local management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to retrieve the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> for an empty area where the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is to be stored (<highlight><bold>15005</bold></highlight>). If an empty area is found, the local management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to change the corresponding LBA of the area management <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> into the allocated (<highlight><bold>15006</bold></highlight>) and requests the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> to duplicate the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>16000</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows the duplicating process executed by the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>. The information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to instruct the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to convey the medium where the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is stored into the drive <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>16002</bold></highlight>). If the medium where the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is stored has been already mounted into the drive, it is not necessary to convey the medium (<highlight><bold>16001</bold></highlight>). The conveyance unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> operates to convey the medium from the shelf where the specified medium is stored into the specified target drive (<highlight><bold>16003</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16004</bold></highlight>). Then, the duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> waists until the medium having been conveyed to the drive is made readable (<highlight><bold>16005</bold></highlight>), issues the read command to the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, reads the data from the system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>16007</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16008</bold></highlight>), issues the write command to the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>16009</bold></highlight>), and writes the data in the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>16010</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16011</bold></highlight>). Upon completion of the write command, the duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of the duplication to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>16012</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in receipt of the report on completion of the duplication, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the WWN, the LBA and the data length of the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in an empty location information row of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> ((<highlight><bold>15007</bold></highlight>), set the effective bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>15008</bold></highlight>), and then report this location information into the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>15009</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In receipt of the location information (WWN, medium number, LBA, and data length), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> operates to issue the read command to disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>15010</bold></highlight>) and read the data from the system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>15011</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15012</bold></highlight>). When the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> accepts the report on completion of reading the data from the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of reading the data to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>15013</bold></highlight>). In receipt of the report on completion of reading the data, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the final access date and time and the duplicating date and time in the file history of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>15014</bold></highlight>), decrement the read count (<highlight><bold>15015</bold></highlight>), and then complete the reading operation (<highlight><bold>15016</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15017</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15018</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In this case, even if the control information of &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; is assigned to the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;, the file &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is not required to be duplicated into the disk array <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> composed of the RAIDS. This is because the data is held in two spots of the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the RAID<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Herein, if the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> makes sure that the duplicated data on the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is not accessed for a given length of time, the management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to reset the effective bit of the location information to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. In this case, the LBA of the area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> corresponding to this location information is returned into the nonuse mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, the description will be oriented to the variation of the control information. The two control informations &ldquo;inexpensively&rdquo; and &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; have been theretofore described. In the following, the description will be oriented to the operation in the case that another control information is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If the control information of &ldquo;fast&rdquo; is given, the data is recorded in two spots, that is, the RAID0 disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Since the RAID0 is inferior in reliability to the RAID5, the reliability can be maintained by recording the data in the two RAID0 disk array systems. If the control information of &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; is added together with the control information of &ldquo;fast&rdquo;, the data is recorded on just one RAID0 disk array system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> If the control information of &ldquo;at long term&rdquo; is given, the data is recorded in a removable optical recording medium such as a DVD-RAM medium. It is reported that the DVD-RAM medium may be stored for thirty years. The DVD-RAM medium lends itself to saving the data for a longer time than the hard disk. If the control information of &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; is given in addition to the control information of &ldquo;at long term&rdquo;, the data is recorded on two mediums. Further, if the control information of &ldquo;fast&rdquo; is given in addition to the control information of &ldquo;at long term&rdquo;, the data is recorded in the disk array system. The data recorded in the disk array system is served as a cache for the library system with a slow access speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> If the control information of &ldquo;for a disaster&rdquo; is given, the data is duplicated in the recording device installed in a remote place. In this case, the attribute data holds the installing place of the storage, and the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> records the data in two recording devices installed in different places. For example, assuming that the installing place of the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;Tokyo&rdquo;, the installing place of the disk array system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;Yokohama&rdquo;, and the installing place of the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;Osaka&rdquo;, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> grasps the geographical relation of the installing places and records the data in two places, that is, the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> located in &ldquo;Tokyo&rdquo; and the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> located in &ldquo;Osaka&rdquo;. When a disaster like an earthquake takes place, the fact that the distance between Tokyo and Yokohama is not for a disaster is pre-set in the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The connecting distance of the fibre channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is 10 km at maximum. In order to connect Tokyo and Yokohama with Osaka, it is necessary to convert the fibre channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into another network like the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> If the control information of &ldquo;in parallel&rdquo; is given, the data is recorded in two places, that is, the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The data recorded in the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is dedicated to the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and the data recorded in the disk array system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is dedicated to the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to determine which of the computers having requested to read the data and report the corresponding location information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> If the control information of &ldquo;portably&rdquo; is given, the data is recorded in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> from which the medium may be removed. At a time, the group ID (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is added to the control information and then the result information is supplied to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. By this operation, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to record the data so that the data sets having the same group ID may be gathered on one medium. For treating the control information of &ldquo;portably&rdquo;, it is necessary to secure the area for holding the group ID in the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Further, the aforementioned embodiments have been requested to give the control information when the data is newly written. Of course, the control information may be changed on the way through the utility. In the following, another way of giving the control information will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an example of a directory structure. The computer system often utilizes the directory structure for file management. This is because grouping the files in folders makes it easier for the user to retrieve the file. For example, in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> route folder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a start point has two subfolders <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The subfolder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has two subfolders <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Assuming that the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is saved in this folder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is &ldquo;1/3/4/AAA&rdquo;. This type of directory is configured so that the basic control information is pre-set to the folder and the control information is succeeded to the files and the subfolders saved in the folder. For example, if &ldquo;no control information&rdquo; is given to the folder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;fast&rdquo; is given to the folder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; is given to the folder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, these control informations are succeeded to the files stored in these folders, respectively. Further, if the folders <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are created in the folder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the control information of &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; of the folder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is automatically given to the folders <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In place, the new control information may be given to the folders <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> without succeeding the control information of the folder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If the control information of &ldquo;at long term&rdquo; is added to the folder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it means that the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; held in the folder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> holds &ldquo;highly reliably&rdquo; and &ldquo;at long term&rdquo; as the default control information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Further, by changing the control information of the folder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it is possible to change all the control informations of the folders and the files following the folder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a batch. When the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is moved from the folder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the folder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is possible to maintain the control information held in the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; as well as give the folder <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> the new control information. In this embodiment, all the settings on the succession of the control information may be set to the local management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> According to the system of the foregoing embodiment, the local management unit operates to select the proper storage among the storages shared by a plurality of computers through the use of the attribute data held in the attribute preservation unit and the control information set to the data and then to hold the data in the selected storage. Since the location management unit holds a plurality of location informations for recording the data, the location management unit enables to record the data in a plurality of storages and record the data according to the various control informations set by the user. All the locations of the data are uniquely managed by the location management unit. Hence, each time the data is moved and copied, the location management unit is not required to report the process to the plurality of computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In turn, the description will be oriented to the second embodiment of the invention (with a cache). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a system configuration of the second embodiment. The difference of the second embodiment from the first embodiment is the respects of providing the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and the information acceptance unit <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> in the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and providing the operation ratio measurement unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in the computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> provided in the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is arranged to be recognized as a hard disk having one WWN by the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the fibre channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Then, the operation ratio measurement unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will be described below. The operation ratio measurement unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> located in the computer operates to measure the processing performance of the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The operation ratio measurement unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> located in the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> operates to measure the processing performance of each disk array system. The processing performance in this embodiment means an average processing time needed for reading or writing the data. If the average processing time is made longer in a certain storage, it indicates that the accesses are focused on the storage. The operation ratio measurement unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> located in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> operates to measure the access frequency for each medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Next, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> will be described below. Like the first embodiment, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment uses the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as well. The area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> manages the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and the medium mounted in the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> as well as the empty areas of the cache disks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> located in the computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Then, the new writing process will be described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> are flowcharts showing the process of newly writing the data in the storage. The file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> operates to request the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> to allocate a new area to the data with the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>9001</bold></highlight>). The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to seek one empty row of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>9002</bold></highlight>), declare the start of the write by setting the write bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>9003</bold></highlight>), and then write the file name (<highlight><bold>9004</bold></highlight>). Herein, it is assumed that the first location information of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> is written. The cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> retrieves the area required for storing the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; by using the area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>9005</bold></highlight>). Herein, assuming that an empty area is sufficiently secured, the allocable location can be obtained. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to change the LBA of the corresponding area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> into the allocated (<highlight><bold>9006</bold></highlight>) and then report the location information to the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>9007</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In receipt of the report on the empty area, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> operates to issue the write command for writing the data in the specified empty area to the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>9008</bold></highlight>). This write is processed within the same computer, so that it is quite fast (<highlight><bold>9009</bold></highlight>). When the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accepts the report on completion of the write from the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>9010</bold></highlight>), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reports the completion of the write to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>9011</bold></highlight>). In receipt of the report on completion of the write, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the WWN, LBA and the data length of the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the first location information of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>9012</bold></highlight>), and set the effective bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>9013</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Then, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to obtain the operation ratios from the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the computer except the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the operation ratio measurement unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> located in the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>9014</bold></highlight>), select the storage with the lowest operation ratio (<highlight><bold>9015</bold></highlight>), and then retrieve an empty area. Herein, assuming that the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has the lowest operation ratio, the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is retrieved for the area required for saving the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;. If the empty area for saving the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is found (<highlight><bold>9016</bold></highlight>), the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to change the LBA of the corresponding area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> into the allocated (<highlight><bold>9017</bold></highlight>) and request the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> to duplicate the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>10000</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the duplicating process performed by the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>. The information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to issue the read command to the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> where the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; has been already written through the information acceptance unit <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>10001</bold></highlight>), read the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>10002</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10003</bold></highlight>), issue the write command to the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>10004</bold></highlight>), and write the data in the system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>10005</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10006</bold></highlight>). Upon completion of the write command, the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> reports the completion of the duplication to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>10007</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, in receipt of the report on completion of the duplication, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the information of the WWN, the LBA and the data length of the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in an empty row of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>, herein, the second location information (<highlight><bold>9019</bold></highlight>), and then set the effective bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>9020</bold></highlight>). Then, the new creation and its date and time and the duplicating date and time are written in the file system (<highlight><bold>9021</bold></highlight>). Lastly, by setting the write bit to &ldquo;0&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>9022</bold></highlight>), the write is completed (<highlight><bold>9023</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9024</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9025</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Then, the reading process will be described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> are flowcharts for illustrating the process of reading data from the storage. In the foregoing writing process, the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is located on the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the host computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Herein, if the host computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> reads out the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>11000</bold></highlight>), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the host computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> requests the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> to read the data with the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; through the Ethernet <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11001</bold></highlight>). The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to select the corresponding row to the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11002</bold></highlight>), make sure that the write bit does not rise (<highlight><bold>11003</bold></highlight>), and increment the read count (<highlight><bold>11004</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

Herein, it is assumed that the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has the lowest operation ratio. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to retrieve the area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> for the area required for storing the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11008</bold></highlight>). Herein, it is assumed that the empty area can be sufficiently secured. It means that the allocable location can be obtained. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to change the LBA of the corresponding area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> into the allocated (<highlight><bold>11009</bold></highlight>) and request the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> to copy the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12000</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

Upon completion of the write command, the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of the duplication to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>12007</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in receipt of the completion of the duplication from the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the WWN, the LBA, and the data length of the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the host computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the empty row of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>, herein, the third location information (<highlight><bold>11011</bold></highlight>) and set the effective bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>11012</bold></highlight>). The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the duplicating date and time in the file history (<highlight><bold>11013</bold></highlight>). The location information of the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the host computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> where the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is entered is reported to the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11014</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In receipt of the report on the location information (WWN, LBA, data length), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> operates to issue the read command to the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11015</bold></highlight>) and then read the data from the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11016</bold></highlight>). When the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accepts the report on completion of reading the data from the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11017</bold></highlight>), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of reading the data to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>11018</bold></highlight>). When the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> accepts the report on the completion of reading the data, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the final access date and time in the file history (<highlight><bold>11019</bold></highlight>), and decrement the read count (<highlight><bold>11020</bold></highlight>), and then completes the reading operation (<highlight><bold>11021</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11022</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11023</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Then, the description will be oriented to the process of updating the data. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> show the flowcharts for illustrating the process of overwriting the data for update. In the foregoing writing and reading processes, the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is resident in three places, that is, the cache disks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the host computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Herein, if the host computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> updates the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>13000</bold></highlight>), the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the host computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> operates to request the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> to update the data with the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>13001</bold></highlight>) through the Ethernet 60 (<highlight><bold>13001</bold></highlight>). The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to select the corresponding row to the file name &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; from the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>13002</bold></highlight>) and then make sure that the write bit is &ldquo;0&rdquo; and the read count is &ldquo;0&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>13003</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13004</bold></highlight>). Unless the write bit is &ldquo;0&rdquo; or the read count is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, it means that the update is failed (<highlight><bold>13090</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13091</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13098</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13099</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> declares the start of the update by setting the write bit to &ldquo;1&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>13005</bold></highlight>). If the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; has a longer data length, it is necessary to retrieve an empty area using the area management table <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> again (<highlight><bold>13006</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13007</bold></highlight>). Herein, the data length is constant. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to report to the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> the third location information (that indicates the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; located in the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) (<highlight><bold>13008</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In receipt of the report on the location information, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> operates to issue to the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> the write command for writing the data on the specified location (<highlight><bold>13009</bold></highlight>). The cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> operates to write the data (<highlight><bold>13010</bold></highlight>) and report the completion of writing the data (<highlight><bold>13011</bold></highlight>). When the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accepts the report on completion of writing the data from the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the file system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of writing the data to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>13012</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In receipt of the report on completion of writing the data, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to request the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> to duplicate the updated data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; on the first location information (that indicates the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; resident in the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>) and the second location information (that indicates the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; resident in the disk array <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) of the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>14000</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the duplicating process executed by the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>. The information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to issue the read command to the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> where the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; has been already written (<highlight><bold>14001</bold></highlight>), read the data from the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>14002</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14003</bold></highlight>), issue the write command to the cache disk <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> at a time (<highlight><bold>14004</bold></highlight>), and then write the data therein (<highlight><bold>14005</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14006</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14005</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>14006</bold></highlight>&prime;). Upon completion of two write command, the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> operates to report the completion of the duplication to the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>14007</bold></highlight>). In this embodiment, the location duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> is associated with the fibre channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and enables to duplicate one data in a plurality of storages at a time. If the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> enables to duplicate one data merely in one storage, the duplicating process is divided into two processes. In this case, it is presumed that the processing time is made longer. Hence, as the copying targets are increased in number, the duplicating process is made more disadvantageous. In this embodiment, it is preferable to use the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> that enables to duplicate the data in a plurality of storages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in receipt of the report on completion of the duplication from the information duplication unit <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight>, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to write the final update date and time in the file history (<highlight><bold>13014</bold></highlight>), and set the write bit to &ldquo;0&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>13015</bold></highlight>), and completes the write (<highlight><bold>13016</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13017</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13018</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In the system according to the second embodiment, since the disk cache is provided in the host computer, the data that has been just written on the host computer is allowed to be temporarily held. Hence, the access becomes fast. The location management unit operates to select the storage with a few access frequency from the operation ratio measurement unit provided in each storage and then save the data in two or more places. It means that the data is not lost if the host computer is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In turn, the description will be oriented to the third embodiment of the invention (that is the method of billing the saved data in the storage provider). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a system configuration according to the third embodiment. In the third embodiment, a plurality of clients <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are connected with the Ethernet <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are served as a file server for accepting the request for writing and reading the data from these clients <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the description has been expanded on the connection with the clients <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through the Ethernet <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. In place, the present invention may be implemented without using this connecting means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the description has been expanded on the installation of the computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the side of the storage service provider. Of course, the computers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be installed in the sales offices and the branches. If the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is spaced from the fibre channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> by <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> km or longer, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected with the fibre channel switch <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> through an extender <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In place of the ATM, another connecting means may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Next, the prompting method will be described below. The clients <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are the terminals prepared in the sales offices and the branches. The user sends out the data to be saved to the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the Ethernet <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. In this case, how the data is saved is specified (the way of saving to be specified for each data is called a data policy). This data holds true to the control information described in the first embodiment. The user would like to save the data with a high access frequency in a fast-access storage or save the data with a low access frequency in an inexpensive storage with a slow access performance. Further, as to the important data, the user also would like to duplicate and save the data in a storage located in a remote place where the data is never lost by something like a disaster even if this is more costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Next, the billing will be described below. In the system according to this embodiment, the preserved data is billed on the basis of the saving cost per a volume unit preserved in the attribute preservation unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> located for each storage and the data length, the file history and the location information preserved in the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> of the location management information. For example, in a case that the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is held in the disk array systems <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for ten days, the data &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; is moved to the disk array system <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and saved therein for ten days, then, the data is moved to the library system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and saved therein for ten days, the data preserving cost of 30 days may be derived by the following expression.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Data preserving cost&equals;&lcub;(preserving cost 10 of RAID0)&times;10 days&times;2&plus;(preserving cost 15 of RAID5)&times;10 days&plus;(preserving cost 1 of the library)&times;10 days&rcub;&times;data length</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> wherein the doubled preserving cost of the RAID0 reflects the doubled preservation of the data in two disk arrays. The location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to calculate the cost of all the data for each month and then bill the user for it. After calculating the cost, the location management unit <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> operates to erase the information on the movement and the duplication of the data from the file history. The information required for calculating the cost is included in the first and the second embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As another example, in a case that the data &ldquo;BBB&rdquo; is preserved in two DVD-RAM mediums for thirty days and is cached in the disk array system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> for three days because it is referenced once, the data preserving cost of 30 days may be derived by the following expression.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Data preserving cost&equals;&lcub;preserving cost 10 of RAID0&rcub;&times;3 days&plus;(preserving cost 1 of the library)&times;30 days&times;2&rcub;&times;data length</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> For calculating the data cost for each user, the WWN is used. For example, in a case that the user A saves the data through the computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the user B saves the data through the host computer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the host computers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> have their respective WWNs, so that if the conversion table <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> is retrieved using the WWN of the target host computer, the total data preserving cost of the user who uses the host computer can be calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Then, the adaptation of the global policy will be described below. As mentioned above, the system of this embodiment enables to easily calculate the cost per a data unit. If the user specifies the data preserving cost for each month, the data is required to be moved for meeting the cost. Of course, as the data amount is made larger, the performance is sacrificed more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> This specification is called a global policy against the data policy. The global policy that has precedence over the performance rather than the cost may be considered. The data policy or the global policy-may be specified as a precedence. If the precedence is given to the data policy and the data preserving cost (global policy) specified by the user cannot be met, the fact is reported to the user. Normally, the setting of the global policy is notified from the user-side client <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> through the host computer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In place, the administrator on the side of the storage service provider enables to set the global policy to the computer <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> on the basis of the setting reference of the global policy to be exchanged between the user and the storage service provider through a document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In the system according to the third embodiment, the data requested by the user to be preserved may be managed in location more fine on the basis of the control information specified by the user and through the attribute preservation unit, the location management unit and the information duplication unit. This makes it possible to associate the cost taken in preserving the data with the activity and the reliability of the data and thereby for the user to allocate the high preserving cost to the data for requiring the high activity and reliability and the low preserving cost to the data of the low activity and reliability. In general, though the data requiring the high activity is small in amount, the system of this embodiment enables to associate the activity and the reliability of the data with the cost, thereby allowing the user to reduce the data preserving cost as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the invention, the location management unit operates to move the data and reproduce the data on the basis of the operation ratio of the storage, the access frequency of the data, the control information, and the billing information, thereby making it possible to perform the data saving in correspondence with the performance, the reliability, the preservation, and the cost. Further, by concentratively managing the locations of the data resident in a plurality of computers and a plurality of storages, it is not necessary to notify each computer of the movement of the data. Further, since the information duplication unit enables to duplicate a plurality of data units at a time, even if the number of computers are large, it is possible to reduce the time taken in reproduction. </paragraph>
