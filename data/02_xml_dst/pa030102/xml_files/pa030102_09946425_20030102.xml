<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An electric, motorized toothbrush includes a switch that has an &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position. The &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; mode provides for intermittent motorized operation, which is dependent upon application of an external force. Various embodiments allow for the force to be exerted either on the toothbrush handle, such as when it is gripped by the user, or on the brush head itself&mdash;e.g., when the brush head contacts the user&apos;s teeth. A substantially hollow housing allows for placement of battery, motor, gears, and linkages to facilitate motorized movement of the brush head. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electric toothbrush with a multi-position switch allowing for an automatic mode of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Use of electric, motorized toothbrushes used as an aid in cleansing teeth is well known. Typically these toothbrushes employ rotating, reciprocating, or oscillating motion, or a combination thereof, to effectuate the cleaning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A feature commonly found on these toothbrushes is a sliding on/off switch located on or near the handle portion of the toothbrush. The primary feature of such a switch is that it remains either in the &ldquo;on&rdquo; position or the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position until the user manually changes it. With such a switch, the user has a limited number of choices. The toothbrush motor can be engaged prior to the brush head being placed in the mouth, or the user can wait until the brush head is placed within the mouth before engaging the motor. Both of these choices have inherent undesirable consequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the user engages the motor prior to placing the brush head in the mouth, the rapid movement of brush head may cause the toothpaste to be shaken off the bristles. Conversely, if the user waits until the brush head is inside the mouth, and in particular in contact with the teeth, it may be difficult to engage the switch, depending on its position relative to the user&apos;s hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved electric, motorized toothbrush that overcomes the above referenced shortcomings of prior art toothbrushes, by providing an automatic mode of operation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an electric, motorized toothbrush that can be used in an &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; mode. The automatic mode allows the user to insert the brush head into the user&apos;s mouth before the motor is engaged and the brush head starts moving. Engagement of the motor is accomplished by one of a number of methods, each of which utilizes an operator sensitive switch located within the toothbrush housing. One method merely requires the user to bring the brush head into contact with one or more teeth; here, the downward force on the brush head actuates the switch. Another method relies on the force generated by the user&apos;s grip to actuate the switch and start the motor. Yet another method involves the use of sensors in the handle such that the presence of the user&apos;s hand actuates the switch that engages the motor. The rotation of the motor, through various mechanical linkages, causes the brush head to oscillate, facilitating tooth cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the toothbrush has a two-piece housing in which most of the components are located. The housing contains a handle portion and a head portion, connected by a neck portion. The handle portion contains a compartment for a plurality of batteries, held in place and electrically connected by an end cap. Also within the handle portion is a first switch, having an &ldquo;off&rdquo; position and an &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A plurality of gears are operatively connected between the motor and a connecting arm. A spur gear, connected to the motor shaft, drives a ring gear which has an integral crank pin. A connecting arm is operatively connected between the crank pin and a shaft, the shaft being located substantially within the neck portion. In operation, this mechanism resembles a typical slider crank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One end of the shaft is located in the head portion of the housing, and is operatively connected to a pinion which is attached to a brush head shaft located on the base side of the brush head. The pinion interfaces with a rack located within the head portion of the housing, thereby facilitating movement of the brush head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, a second switch is located substantially within the neck portion of the housing. This switch is characterized by two contact plates. The contact plates are not normally electrically connected; this keeps the electric circuit open. When a force is exerted on the brush head&mdash;e.g., when the brush head is in contact with the user&apos;s teeth&mdash;the two contact plates electrically connect, the circuit is closed, and the motor is engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the second switch is located in the handle portion of the toothbrush. Here, the user squeezes a compressible portion of the handle, thereby closing the second switch. Different types of switches can be employed for this purpose, but the end result is the same. The motor will not rotate and the brush head will not move until the user squeezes the handle and actuates the second switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention also places the second switch in the handle portion; however, in this embodiment, sensors on the outside of the handle detect the presence of the user&apos;s hand. Hence, the user need not apply a gripping force to the handle to actuate this switch, rather, mere contact with the sensors closes the switch and completes the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In each of these embodiments, the first switch can be a three-position switch instead of the two-position switch described above. The use of a three-position switch adds as an option, a continuous &ldquo;on&rdquo; mode of operation. That is, the toothbrush could still be used in an &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; mode, or turned off completely, but the addition of the continuous &ldquo;on&rdquo; mode of operation would allow the toothbrush to be used in the manner of conventional motorized toothbrushes.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a simplified descriptive side view of an electric toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. Switch button <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> slides into one of two positions: &ldquo;off&rdquo; or &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;. While in the automatic mode, motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is engaged only when a force (F) is exerted on the brush head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. This force causes a slight movement of the brush head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the direction of the force. Because of this movement, a switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is actuated, an electric circuit is completed, and current flows from batteries <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> transmits power to brush head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through a series of mechanical linkages, shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a simple wiring schematic <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of a circuit for the toothbrush shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Motor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is electrically connected between a power source <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a switch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. When switch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position, the circuit is open and there is no voltage across motor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When switch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position, control of motor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is transferred to switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. While operating in the automatic mode, the motor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is only engaged when a force (F) is applied to switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can be located in various locations within the toothbrush housing, such as in the handle or under the brush head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an exploded view of an electric toothbrush <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. A two-piece housing comprises a bottom housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a top housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The housing has a handle portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a neck portion <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and a head portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Within the handle portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a battery compartment <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Batteries <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are located within the battery compartment <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and are electrically connected to each other by a battery connector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The batteries <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and battery connector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are held in place by an end cap <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Also within the handle portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are battery plates <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which connect to the positive <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>A and negative <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>B battery terminals, respectively. Switch button plate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, is actuated using switch button <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and switch cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. To facilitate use of the toothbrush in the automatic mode, a first contact plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a second contact plate <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are located substantially within the neck portion of the housing. First contact plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to switch button plate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> via a first wire <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and second contact plate <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to negative battery plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> via a second wire <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When switch button <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position, switch button plate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> does not contact negative terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>B. When switch button <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position, switch button plate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is in contact with negative terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>B, but not the negative battery plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. For current to flow to motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, when switch button <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is in the automatic position, it is therefore necessary for first contact plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and second contact plate <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to be electrically connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is mounted inside handle portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by means of motor mount <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. When current flows to motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, motor shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>C rotates, causing rotation of spur gear <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which is mounted on motor shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>C. Spur gear <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> meshes with ring gear <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which is provided with an eccentric crank pin <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. Crank pin <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a pivot on the first end of connecting arm <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The second end of connecting arm <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to shaft <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, which is held in alignment by bearing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Electrical components are protected from contact with liquid by seal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In operation, as ring gear <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> rotates, eccentric crank pin <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and the first end of connecting arm <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> rotate. This causes the second end of the connecting arm <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and shaft <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> to translate axially in a typical slider crank manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Pinion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to shaft <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and is attached to brush head shaft <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>A. Rack <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is securely mounted inside the neck portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As shaft <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> reciprocates, the interaction of pinion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and rack <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> causes brush head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to translate and rotate simultaneously. Brush head shaft <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>A is integrally connected to brush head base <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>B. Brush head bristles <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>C are mounted on brush head base <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>B, on the side opposite brush head shaft <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Axial pressure on brush head bristles <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>C causes a deflection of shaft <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> in the direction of the bottom housing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, in constant contact with plate <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, then moves a short distance until it also contacts plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>; the two contact plates are thereby electrically connected. The electrical connection of the first contact plate <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> with the second contact plate <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, has no effect if switch button <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position. However, when switch button <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position, the electrical connection of the two contact plates completes the electric circuit that allows current to flow to motor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. This means that when switch button <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position, motorized movement of brush head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is predicated upon an axial force being applied to brush head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an electric toothbrush <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is shown in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention. Switch button <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> slides into one of two positions: &ldquo;off&rdquo; or &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;. While in the automatic mode, motorized movement of brush head <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> occurs only when a force (F) is exerted on the compressible portion <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the tooth brush handle <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. This force causes magnet <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to move in close proximity to switch plates <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. When magnet <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> gets within a critical distance of switch plates <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, the plates contact each other, thereby engaging the drive motor (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The magnetic switch mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in circle A, is shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. Normally, the switch is open; that is, magnet <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is far enough away from magnetic plate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>A such that non-magnetic plate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>B does not contact plate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>A. After force (F) is applied to the compressible portion <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> of the toothbrush handle <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, and the distance between magnet <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and magnetic plate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>A drops below the minimum critical gap <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, plate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>A is drawn toward magnet <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> such that it contacts plate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a plan view of toothbrush <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with a one-piece compressible portion <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. A third embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, uses a two-piece compressible portion. Here, toothbrush <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> has a two-piece compressible portion made up of rigid portion <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and non-rigid portion <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, which is attached to toothbrush handle <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> fourth embodiment is shown. Again, an electric toothbrush handle <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> contains a compressible portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As in the preferred embodiment, magnet <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is located beneath the compressible portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Here however, the switch plates have been replaced with a Hall effect sensor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Application of force (F) to compressible portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> causes the distance between the magnet <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the Hall effect sensor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to decrease. When this distance is small enough, current flows through the Hall effect sensor <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the motor is engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a fifth embodiment of the present invention. Electric toothbrush handle <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> contains compressible portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Below the compressible portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are two contact plates <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Application of force (F) to compressible portion <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> causes the two contact plates to electrically connect, thereby completing an electric circuit and engaging the toothbrush motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, an electric toothbrush <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is shown in accordance with a sixth embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the mere presence of the user&apos;s hand on the handle causes movement of the brush head. In this figure, sensors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are located on the toothbrush handle. Typically a capacitive sensor would be used in this embodiment to allow the presence of the user&apos;s hand to close a switch in the handle, thereby engaging the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> An electric circuit for this embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Here, switch <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> has two positions: &ldquo;off&rdquo;, in which the circuit is open and no current can flow from power source <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> to motor <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;, in which control of motor <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> is transferred to switch <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. While in the automatic mode, the presence of the user&apos;s hand on the toothbrush handle will engage tactile sensors <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. This causes switch <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> to close, and allows current to flow to motor <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a simple wiring schematic <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of a circuit configuration applicable to any of the embodiments described above. The button (shown as <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), now actuates a switch that has three positions instead of two. Turning back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, this switch is shown as <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. When switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position, circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is open and there is no voltage across motor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. When switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;on&rdquo; position, circuit <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is closed and there is a continuous voltage across motor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Finally, when switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position, control of the motor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is transferred to circuit <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> closes circuit <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> only upon application of a force (F) to switch <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Hence, when switch <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is in the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; position, current will flow from power source <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> to motor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> only as long as a force (F) is applied to switch <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Removal of force (F) opens circuit <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, thereby disengaging motor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
