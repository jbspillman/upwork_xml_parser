<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a technique using sound-producing and detecting devices for enhancing the functionality of a portable radio device, particularly a telephone or other radio communication device. It finds particular utility when used in conjunction with devices employing local wireless radio technology, such as Bluetooth. Throughout this specification, &lsquo;acoustic&rsquo; is intended to include pressure waves&mdash;both audible and inaudible. It specifically includes ultrasound as well as sounds in the audible spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Portable devices are available which employ Bluetooth low power RF technology to allow point to point transmissions from one device to another. Typical uses for Bluetooth include PC-printer connections, PC-telephone connections and electronic or mobile-commerce (e-commerce/m-commerce). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Bluetooth has a range which can be measured in meters or tens of meters, and while this is suitable for some applications, certain other applications require a shorter range for a variety of reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One such application is m-commerce, where a user may use a suitably equipped portable telephone or wireless device to authorise payment. A problem with such a system lies in the fact that at a retail outlet payment point, there may be many users seeking to pay using their suitably equipped device and, if they all operate within the range of the payment point, possible security and access problems may occur. An example of such a scenario is a fast food outlet where there may be many pay points, and many people waiting in line to pay. In such a situation, the number of potential handsets may be huge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The problem in such a situation becomes trying to establish a bi-directional communication link only with the desired party and not a bystander. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of wirelessly communicating between a first and second device, comprising the steps of: transmitting a first set of data from the first device to the second device using a radio signal; and transmitting a second set of encoded data from the first device to the second device using an acoustic signal, wherein the first set of data comprises information related to the encoding of the second set of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a device for communicating wirelessly, comprising: a first receiver arranged to receive a radio transmission comprising a first set of data; a second receiver arranged to receive an acoustic transmission comprising a second set of encoded data; a processor arranged to decode the second set of data utilising information from the first set of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a device for communicating wirelessly, comprising: a first transmitter arranged to transmit a radio signal comprising a first set of data; a second transmitter for transmitting an acoustic signal comprising a second set of data encoded using information from the first set of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, embodiments of the present invention allow proximity measurement to be made in a straightforward manner using portable wireless devices. Applications for such devices include any situation where security of transaction and the relative proximity of the two parties is important. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, RF and ultrasonic signal are used in co-operation with each other to ensure that defined and/or identified parties are able to communicate in a secure manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, RF and ultra wide sound (UWS) signals are used for communication in a similar fashion to the ultrasound embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> UWS is a system utilising short pulses, preferably single cycles, of sound from the audible part of the audio spectrum. Such pulses are not as directional as ultrasound signals and this can offer advantages in certain scenarios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> UWS enables devices to communicate using currently available and commonly used transducers such as microphones and loudspeakers commonly found in portable telephones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The UWS signals occupy a wide bandwidth, but are of low amplitude, rendering them inaudible to the human ear. However, a suitably arranged receiver is able to discern the pulses and reconstruct a digital signal which conveys information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Various statistical techniques may be employed to improve the reliability of the UWS communication link. A simple technique requires repetition of the transmitted pulses at defined intervals. The receiver is then able to perform a statistical analysis on the most likely value of a given pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Error correction and detection techniques may also be employed to make the communication link more robust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In different embodiments, different devices may be equipped with only acoustic receivers, transmitters or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention provide advantages where it is necessary to provide secure communication between two devices within a defined range. The acoustic signal provides the means by which proximity may be determined, and both acoustic and radio signals may be encoded to ensure that communications are secure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Situations where such security and proximity requirements are needed is in secure payment using a portable device as a payment device, controlled entry into restricted areas and access to a compute system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of certain elements of a system employing both Bluetooth low power RF signalling and sound or acoustic signalling. Bluetooth is known as a scheme by which low power RF signals may be exchanged between suitably equipped devices for the transfer of information. Other low power RF communication schemes are known or envisaged which are also suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The Bluetooth equipped devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are further equipped to include acoustic signalling capabilities. In this embodiment, the acoustic signalling utilises ultrasound pressure waves, which are inaudible to the human ear, but which may be generated and received using either custom ultrasound devices, or hybrid audible sound and ultrasound transducers. Such hybrid devices may replace the earpiece and microphone customarily found in portable telephone devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The system comprises two major elements: a terminal device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and a base unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The terminal device may be a portable telephone, a personal computer, a personal organiser or other portable electronic apparatus. In a particular embodiment, the portable device is an enhanced personal telephone, arranged to include identity data linking it closely with one or more individuals. The enhanced telephone has the capability, amongst other things, to perform and authorise electronic payment and open security doors to which its owner has access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises RF circuitry <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> enabling it to communicate via the Bluetooth communication standard. Bluetooth is primarily intended for use in a point-to-point manner over relatively short distances&mdash;a few meters to a few tens of meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As previously mentioned a problem with radio technology used for transactions such as payment or allowing access to secure areas, is that it can prove difficult to determine exactly which terminal is currently being communicated with if there are several within range of the requesting device, e.g. a door to secure area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Sound waves, however, have a shorter range than radio waves, and it is generally simpler to calculate the distance from which a sound transmission was made by measuring the difference in time between reception of a radio signal, and reception of a sound signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Antenna <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is used to transmit a radio signal <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. The signal is received by antenna <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> some time later. The radio wave travels at the speed of light and over a short distance, its time of arrival may be considered to be instantaneous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Ultrasound transducer <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> emits an ultrasound signal <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> simultaneously with the radio signal <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. As the ultrasound signal only travels at the speed of sound, it arrives significantly later than the radio signal. The difference in time of arrival of the two signals <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> is directly proportional to the distance between the receiving and transmitting devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> By measuring the times difference (&Dgr;t) between the two received signals, it is possible to calculate the proximity of the terminal. In this way, only a terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> positioned within a defined radius of the base unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be authenticated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to transmitting the radio and ultrasound signals simultaneously, there may be a defined time relationship between them. For instance, the system may be configured such that the ultrasound signal is always transmitted a certain period after the radio signal is transmitted. If the receiving device knows this period, then the proximity may be calculated on this basis. Alternatively, the period between the radio and ultrasound transmissions may be explicitly specified in the initial radio transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> typical sequence of events may be as follows. The base unit controller <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> transmits, via a Bluetooth unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and transmitter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> for reception by the Bluetooth unit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> comprises information concerning a sound transmission which follows the RF transmission, or is sent simultaneously. Such information may comprise details of the encoding of the acoustic signal. The encoding ensures that the terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is prepared for a transmission on a particular frequency, or having a certain encoding scheme or comprising a certain key signature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> On receipt of signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> updates its internal memory with the details of the impending sound transmission, and is then prepared to receive a signal in a now known format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The base unit then sends the sound signal <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> via sound processor <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and ultrasound transducer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The acoustic signal <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is received by ultrasound transducer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The time of arrival can be determined, and on that basis the distance between the two devices can be calculated. If the proximity threshold is satisfied, and the received sound signal correlates with the data already identified in RF transmission <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, then the terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> transmits an RF signal <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> verifying that the signals correlate, and the base unit can then authorise the requested transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As highlighted before, the transaction may involve authorising payment, opening a secure door or any other activity where security and proximity need to be confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a secure access scenario&mdash;the base unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be located adjacent a secure door to which only certain pre-defined people have access. The base unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may periodically transmit a radio signal requesting all devices in its range&mdash;e.g. within 5 meters of the door&mdash;to identify themselves also via a radio signal. Obviously, not everyone within the 5 m range is going to want to pass through the door&mdash;some people may pass by. However, if the base unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is aware in advance of who is likely to want to enter, it can choose to ignore those people who have no access rights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> With such a system, firstly, it is not possible to accurately measure or calculate proximity using the Bluetooth signal alone as there is no simple way of measuring propagation time to the required degree of accuracy. Secondly, it is not possible to perform a proximity measurement using received signal strength as there too many variables which could impact this figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> If an authorised person, carrying terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> enters into a region <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> closer to the door&mdash;say 1 meter&mdash;then his proximity may be established as outlined above using an ultrasound signal. The door can then be unlocked or opened to allow him access, without him having to interact with the automated process in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The proximity calculation may be performed either in the terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or the base unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The system may specify that only base units have acoustic transmitters and terminals have receivers, or vice-versa. Alternatively, each unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may have both transmitters and receivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Even if an authorised person carrying terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&prime; walks towards the door, he will not cause the door to be opened until he crosses the threshold <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The threshold can be defined by the system operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to adapt a prior art telephone to incorporate ultrasound transducers for sending and/or receiving ultrasound signals, either additional components have to be introduced into the telephones, or hybrid audio/ultrasound devices are required. Additional costs are undesirable but, if sufficient volumes of product can be achieved, may be tolerable. Hybrid components invariably involve a degree of compromise in performance, but may be suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Ultrasonic pressure waves are more directional than sound waves at an audible frequency. Depending on the proposed use of the system, this directionality can pose problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, existing audio transducers, present in any case in all telephones, can be used for sound signalling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Experiments have shown that the human ear is unable to discern sound pulses of low amplitude and short duration. Short duration is here intended to mean pulses of the order of a single cycle of sound energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A single cycle pulse of sound energy, having a short duration in the time domain, consequently has a wide spread in the frequency domain. As such, communication comprising transmission of a series of seemingly randomly distributed single cycles of sound energy does not produce any noticeable peaks in the audio frequency spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Such transmissions will therefore remain inaudible to the human ear, even though the individual pulses may comprise a cycle of sound which would be audible if transmitted continuously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The transducers already present in portable telephone devices are capable of being operated to produce and detect single cycles of sound, but in prior art devices there is no motivation to do so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an exaggerated waveform <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> having the characteristics of a so-called ultra wide sound (UWS) signal. The signal is characterised by the low amplitude single cycles of sound energy transmitted at pseudo-random intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> If such a signal <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> were applied to a loudspeaker, there would be no sound apparent to the human ear. If the amplitude of the pulses were increased, a noise akin to white noise would be audible. The exact nature of the sound produced is dependent on the fundamental frequency of the single cycle, as this determines the spread of the signal in the frequency domain. However, amplitude levels required by embodiments of the invention are not audible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Each transmission of sound may be considered to be split into a plurality of timeslots. Within each timeslot, there are at least two possible positions where a pulse may be present. The information content of a particular timeslot is determined by which position is occupied by a pulse. For example, a pulse in the first position could signify a &lsquo;0&rsquo;, and a pulse in the second position could indicate a &lsquo;1&rsquo;. If a timeslot comprises more than two possible positions, then multi-bit data may be represented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the timeslot nature of the signal <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. A transmitter of UWS sends out acoustic signals comprising a number of pulses of single-cycle sound energy. The pulses are arranged to occupy timeslots. A channel of communication between a transmitting and receiving device may be defined by certain timeslot numbers. For instance, channel x is defined as comprising timeslots j, k, l, m . . . p, q, r. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the channel number is the data which is included in the transmission <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> sent from the base unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the terminal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In this way, the terminal knows how to receive the data which is comprised in the acoustic transmission which is to follow i.e. which timeslots to listen out for. Unlike the previously described embodiment which used continuous ultrasound signals, this embodiment uses UWS for the acoustic signalling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment the proximity is determined on the time difference between the arrival of an RF signal and an acoustic UWS signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The dotted boxes <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> represent the timeslots. The timeslots <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> illustrated are those picked out from all received timeslots on the basis of the received channel information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> From the received timeslots, the data transmitted can be determined from the position within the timeslot occupied by a pulse of sound energy. A &lsquo;0&rsquo; is represented by a position at the start of a timeslot, and a &lsquo;1&rsquo; is represented by a position at the end of a timeslot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Thus, the data represented by the signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is 011010011011. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Due to the low amplitude of the single cycle sound transmissions, individual pulses may well be swamped at the receiver by noise. In order to provide a degree of statistical confidence that the information represented by any single pulse is received, each pulse may be transmitted several times in a pseudo random sequence to which the transmitter and receiver are synchronised. In this way, each bit of information is repeatedly transmitted in a timeslot known to the receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> If, for example, a particular bit of data is transmitted 10 times in defined locations, the receiver is able to decide, on a statistical basis, whether that bit is a &lsquo;0&rsquo; or a &lsquo;1&rsquo;. Error coding and checking using known techniques can be added to provide a self-correcting, or at least error-checking system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that embodiments of the invention may be realised using a combination of transmissions of RF energy, using, e.g Bluetooth, and transmissions of acoustic energy, such as ultrasonic signals or ultra wide sound (UWS) signals as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Although described in terms of single cycles of sound energy, the skilled man will be aware that the human ear reacts differently to different sound levels and frequencies, and depending on various factors such as desired range of operation and environment, the embodiments of the invention may be realised which use pulses comprising more than a single cycle of sound, provided that such pulses remain substantially inaudible to the human ear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As well as being used to enhance proximity detection as described above, the concept of ultra wide sound may find application in fields as diverse as seismic surveying and SONAR. The low amplitude, inaudible signals may offer many benefits in these and other fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes any novel feature or combination of features disclosed herein either explicitly or any generalisation thereof irrespective of whether or not it relates to the claimed invention or mitigates any or all of the problems addressed. </paragraph>
