<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a confidential information management system suitable for use in storing and managing various types of information (confidential information: ID numbers, passwords, encryption keys, digital certificates, etc.) to be used in user verification. The present invention also relates to information terminals employed in the present system for downloading such confidential information thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> User verification (to confirm an object user of a system or an application is an authorized user) has recently been carried out by using confidential information, such as personal identification codes and passwords (hereinafter will be also called &ldquo;password verification&rdquo;). In this method, the confidential information input by the object user is compared with that registered previously. If the two are then decided to be identical, the object user is verified. This method provides a handy, user-friendly verification, and thus is the most common method of user verification in today&apos;s system infrastructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Multifunctional mobile information terminals &lcub;various types of potable information terminals such as PDAs (personal digital assistants) and mobile telephones&rcub; nowadays not only function as electronic notepads or telephones but also receive/transmit electronic information and image information via wired/wireless networks. Further, such mobile information terminals can also be used in bank account settlement, electronic commerce, or securities trading. For realizing these varying functions in one mobile information terminal, various types of applications are started or executed on the mobile information terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When such applications are started or executed on the mobile information terminal, an ID and a password must be input for each application. Likewise, when bank account settlement or electronic commerce transaction is performed, a bank account number and a personal identification code must be input. In general, such an ID and a bank account number are previously stored in a memory or the like so that it is unnecessary for the user to input such numbers by himself/herself, while the confidential information (password and personal identification code) for use in user verification must be input by the user with push or touch buttons (ten keys). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the user must remember plural passwords or personal identification codes, one for each application or system (bank, etc.). In cases where a variety of passwords and personal identification codes are used, the following problems (a) through (d) are encountered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (a) Many of users tend to use an easy-to-remember string of characters or digits as a password or a PIN; for example, the user&apos;s or family member&apos;s name or birthday, telephone number, favorite word, etc. Assuming that an information terminal with such passwords or personal identification codes registered is stolen or lost, there is a danger that an unauthorized person might use the bank account settlement or electronic commerce function equipped in the terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (b) Using passwords or personal identification codes in user verification makes the system simple with reduced manufacturing cost, but it is necessary for the user to be security-conscious. Otherwise if hard-to-remember passwords or personal identification codes are used in an effort to increase the security, the user might forget them. If the passwords or personal identification codes are stored in the information terminal for the user&apos;s convenience, they can be easily read by unauthorized persons because of the poor security so that the unauthorized person can use the above-mentioned functions of the terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (c) A single-sign-on system or LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol), in which a single password is used to log-in to plural systems collectively, is rendered poor in security, because an unauthorized person may access all the relevant systems merely by inputting the one single password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> (d) Since the single-sign-on system is based on the premise that each of the relevant systems is associated with one another, it is difficult to support all systems by a single-sign-on system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, in addition to the above-mentioned confidential information, the user&apos;s property (ID card, etc.) and the user&apos;s biometric information (fingerprint, palmprint, finger shape, hand shape, voiceprint, retina, iris, facial recognition, signature dynamics, blood vessel pattern, key strokes, etc.), unique to the user, are also used in verifying the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The former is disadvantageous in that user verification cannot be performed if the user forgets to carry the property (ID card, etc.) on him/her. Further, since an unauthorized person can also use the property, the security level is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The latter is disadvantageous not only in that all users cannot employ the method, but also in that plural IDs must be remembered, one for each system, thereby necessitating troublesome management of those IDs for the user. Moreover, in order to employ this method, it is necessary to make significant changes to existing user verification infrastructures which are adapted to the currently popular types of password verification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In view of these, it has been hoped that an effective and secure use of the conventional password verification is accomplished, without employing such as a single-sign-on system, nor making any changes to the existing user verification infrastructures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing problems in view, one object of the present invention is to provide a confidential information management system which allows users to securely obtain confidential information files containing various confidential information, which files are securely stored in the present system, anywhere and anytime, using a minimum of confidential information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide an information terminal for use in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In order to accomplish the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a confidential information management system comprising: a confidential information managing server for storing and managing confidential information files each in an encoded form in such a manner that each of the confidential information files is available to only an authorized user; an encoding/decoding software managing sever for storing and managing encoding/decoding software which encodes/decodes the individual confidential information files; and one or more information terminals each capable of having access to both the confidential information managing server and the encoding/decoding software managing sever via a communications network. Each of the information terminals has an environment such as to operate the encoding/decoding software, and is operable, after an authorized user who intends to access an individual confidential information file is verified, to download the last-named individual confidential information file and the encoding/decoding software from the confidential information managing server and the encoding/decoding software managing sever, respectively, and to decode the downloaded confidential information file using the encoding/decoding software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As one preferred feature, the confidential information management system further comprises an access managing server for managing access attempts of the user from the information terminal to both the confidential information managing server and the encoding/decoding software managing server by verifying the user, and the access managing server is operable, upon completion of the user verification, to permit the information terminal to access both the confidential information managing server and the encoding/decoding software managing server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As another preferred feature, the confidential information management system further comprises a secure server for providing a secure environment in communications between the access managing server and the information terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As still another preferred feature, in the confidential information management system, the information terminal is operable, if any change has been made to the decoded confidential information file, or if a new confidential information file is intended to be stored in the confidential information managing server, to encode the resulting confidential information file or the new confidential information file using the encoding/decoding software before uploading such encoded confidential information file to the confidential information managing server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As one generic feature of the present invention, there is provided an information terminal adapted to be capable of having access to both a confidential information managing server, which stores and manages confidential information files each in an encoded form in such a manner that each of the confidential information files is available to only an authorized user, and an encoding/decoding software managing server, which stores and manages encoding/decoding software for encoding/decoding the individual confidential information files, via a communications network, wherein: the information terminal has an environment such as to operate the encoding/decoding software; and after an authorized user who intends to access an individual confidential information file is verified, the information terminal is operable to download the last-named individual confidential information file and the encoding/decoding software from the confidential information managing server and the encoding/decoding software managing server, respectively, and to decode the downloaded individual confidential information file using the encoding/decoding software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With using the confidential information management system and the information terminal of the present invention, a user can obtain a confidential information file anywhere with a minimum of confidential information. In more particular, after the user is verified with the minimal confidential information, the user is allowed to obtain the confidential information file on the information terminal. At that time, since the thus obtained confidential information file is an encoded file, it cannot be decoded without using a type of decoding software corresponding to the encoding software by which the file has been encoded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Since the access managing server performs the user verification collectively, it is possible to manage access attempts of the user from the information terminal to each managing server, under centralized control by the access managing server. Further, with the secure server, it is possible to guarantee a safe transmission of the above-mentioned minimum confidential information from the information terminal to the access managing server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a new confidential information file or a confidential information file to which any change has been made, is encoded by encoding/decoding software before being uploaded to the confidential information managing server. That is, using the information terminal, it is possible to make some changes to the confidential information file stored in the confidential information managing server, and to store a new confidential information file in the confidential information managing server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The confidential information management system and the information terminal of the present invention guarantee the following advantageous results: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (1) Since confidential information files containing various confidential information or confidential executing programs, which files are securely stored in the present system, are obtained in a safe manner anywhere at any time using a minimum of confidential information, it is possible to free a user from memorizing or taking notes of numerous passwords or personal identification codes, thereby resolving various problems relevant to the managing and the securing of the confidential information files. And also, even if such passwords or personal identification codes are made up of a string of characters that is difficult to memorize, it is possible to obtain the passwords or the personal identification codes in a safe manner anywhere at any time, as well as to store the passwords or the personal identification codes securely. The use of easy passwords or personal identification codes vulnerable to abuse can thus be prevented, thereby significantly improving the security level of a user verification system that employs password verification. Accordingly, the present invention provides an effective and secure use of a general type of password verification, without using a single-sign-on system or other system, nor making any changes to existing user verification infrastructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (2) Since such a confidential information file is an encoded file, it cannot be decoded without using a type of decoding software corresponding to the encoding software with which the file has been encoded. It is thus possible to prevent server administrators from misusing confidential information files, and also, even if a confidential information file should be intercepted or leaked, a third party (unauthorized user) cannot see the contents of the confidential information file, thereby guaranteeing a high level of security. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> (3) Since the confidential information files are encoded, the security of a one-to-one communication between the confidential information managing server and the information terminal can be retained, thus facilitating the construction of confidential information managing servers and confidential information systems that require a high level of security. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> (4) Since the encoding/decoding software can be downloaded from a dedicated purpose server, it is possible for the user to view and make changes to the confidential information file in a safe manner even when accessing from an information terminal which is authorized to any other user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> (5) Since the confidential information files containing passwords and personal identification codes can be obtained anywhere at any time, it is possible to significantly reduce the maintenance cost of the systems in which the password verification is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> (6) Since, if applied to systems employing PKI verification, the present invention surely prevents encryption keys for PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) from being made invalid due to inadvertent handling, it is possible to prevent a list of invalid digital certificates from becoming too big. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> (7) Since a confidential information file is transmitted between each information terminal and a confidential information managing server, which are connected in a one-to-one relationship, it is possible to employ biometric information-utilized user verification with ease to verify users who intend to access a confidential information file stored in the server. Further, user verification using two or more types of biometric information is also facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> (8) Since the access managing server performs user verification collectively, it is possible to manage access attempts by the user from the information terminal to each managing server, under centralized control by the access managing server. Each managing server is thus freed from making user verification separately, thereby simplifying the processing carried out by each managing server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> (9) Since the use of the secure server guarantees the security of the above-mentioned minimal confidential information, which is transmitted from the information terminal to the access managing server, an improved security level is realized in the confidential information managing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> (10) When a new confidential information file or a confidential information file to which any change has been made is uploaded to the confidential information managing server, such a file is encoded by encoding/decoding software on the information terminal before being transmitted to the confidential information managing server and stored therein. It is thus possible to realize a sufficient level of security of the confidential information even if communication between the confidential information managing server and the information terminal does not comply with the security features of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Thus, mobile telephones commonly distributed in the market can serve as the information terminals of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> (11) Since the information terminal has a display on which the contents of a decoded confidential information file are to be shown, the user can view the contents immediately. At that time, since both a computer system name and the confidential information associated with the computer system name are shown on the display, it is possible to input required information to a computer system whose name is identical with the computer system name shown on the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> (12) Partly since only computer system names are shown on the display, and partly since the confidential information associated with an object computer system name is sent, responsive to a predetermined operation made by the user, to a computer system whose name is identical with the object computer system name shown on the display, the confidential information itself is no longer shown on the display, thereby further improving the security of the confidential information. At the same time, since the user is freed from inputting the confidential information, user operation is simplified and the unscrupulous viewing and abuse by third parties of confidential information input by the user is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> (13) Since with the lapse of a predetermined time after completion of the decoding of the confidential information file, the decoded confidential information file is deleted on the information terminal, there is no possibility of the confidential information file held in the information terminal being stolen by a third party, thereby guaranteeing improved security of the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> (14) Since the contents of the decoded confidential information file stored in storage means are shown on the display upon completion of the user verification made by verifying means of the information terminal, the contents of the confidential information file can be securely stored in the storage means of the information terminal, while only an authorized user is allowed to view the contents shown on the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> (15) Since upon the decoding of the confidential information file a program contained in the decoded confidential information file is executed on the information terminal, it is possible for the information terminal to automatically move to the operation instructed by the program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> (16) Since a radio token, which is carried by the user, wirelessly communicates with the information terminal periodically so that the decoded confidential information file is deleted on the information terminal unless the information terminal receives a periodic response from the radio token, it is possible to delete the confidential information file on the information terminal if the user with the radio token is separated from the information terminal, or if the terminal is stolen from the user, thereby preventing the confidential information file from being stolen by a third party and thus guaranteeing improved security of the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> (17) Since the radio token holds information relevant to an encryption key needed for decoding the confidential information file, and sends the information to the information terminal on a request from the information terminal, only the user who carries the radio token can decode the confidential information file with use of encoding/decoding software, and it is no longer needed to take notes of the information with respect to an encryption key nor to store such information in a memory of any information device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> (18) Since the radio token is activated in response to the user verification with a password on the information terminal, it is possible to securely store the information with respect to the encryption key in the radio token. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> (19) Since the encryption key, needed for decoding the confidential information file, is generated from a predetermined text password that is input to the information terminal by an authorized user, it is possible to input the encryption key to the information terminal as a kind of password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> (20) Since the information terminal includes an interface to an external storage medium that holds information relevant to an encryption key for decoding the confidential information file, it is possible to input the encryption key-relevant information from the external storage medium to the information terminal via the interface. This frees the user from inputting the encryption key-relevant information by herself/himself, thereby simplifying user operation, and also preventing encryption key-relevant information input by the user from being unscrupulously looked at and abused by a third party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> (21) Since the information terminal downloads a suitable one of the plural types of encoding/decoding software at a fixed time interval, and periodically alters an encoding system currently used in the confidential information file stored in the confidential information managing server into another encoding system that is offered by the downloaded encoding/decoding software, it is possible to guarantee an improved level of security of the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> (22) Since the user obtains identification (ID) information and a password, which authorize the user to access the confidential information management system, by purchasing a prepaid card, it is possible to protect the user&apos;s anonymity regarding the confidential information management system. That is, it cannot be identified which one of the files stored in the confidential information managing server belongs to whom, thereby surely preventing misuse of such confidential information files. Moreover, prepaid cards are convenient to collect charges for use of the confidential information management system, in advance, at the time of issuance of ID information and passwords. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> (23) Since each of the information terminals is a mobile telephone connectable to the Internet, it is possible to download a confidential information file anywhere at any time over the Internet. At that time, if the subscriber number of the mobile telephone is used as the ID information of the user, it is possible to employ a call-back system common to mobile telephones for verifying the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> (24) Since the information terminal includes sampling means for sampling biometric information of the user for use in verifying the user, it is no longer necessary for the user to input a password to download a confidential information file, and the security level of the confidential information file is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> (25) Partly since user verification using biometric information is performed on the information terminal, and partly since the information relevant to an encryption key needed for decoding the confidential information file and the information needed for verifying the user are read out from storage means of the information terminal upon completion of the user verification, it is possible to store and manage such information securely on the information terminal. At that time, since biometric user verification can be carried out separately for individual users (for each information terminal), it is possible to employ the biometric user verification without making any changes to existing user verification infrastructures. And also, since the type of biometric information to be used in the verification is selected by the user on his/her own, that most convenient to the user can be selected. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Today&apos;s widespread use of mobile telephones that are connectable with the Internet, such as i-mode (a trademark and/or service mark owned by NTT DoCoMo), has been realizing a personal, portable network environment. As a result, it has been becoming common for the user, if needing any information, to fetch such information (onto a mobile phone, etc.), over a network, from a 24-hour working server that is located anywhere, and not to store the information in a memory of an information terminal. A train schedule providing service via i-mode would be a good example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In view of this, the confidential information managing system of the present invention includes a server for storing confidential information files, which server guarantees a secure communication environment, as well as utilizes the above-mentioned network environment, thereby enabling a user to obtain a confidential information file anywhere at any time using a minimum of confidential information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a description will be made of an example where information terminals are mobile telephones, and confidential information contained in a confidential information file includes an encryption key for PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) a digital certificate, or a program such as a confidential execution program, as well as the information to be used in user verification such as computer system names, IDs, passwords, and personal identification codes. At that time, the confidential execution program is a type of software for connecting a mobile telephone with a security server (reference character <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), which executes particular processing for decoding an encoded confidential information file having been downloaded to the mobile telephone so that the contents of the file are viewed by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In this manner, according to the present invention, it is no longer necessary for the user to remember or store in a mobile telephone memory such information as computer system names, IDs, and passwords (personal identification codes) as these can be stored in an encoded form in a 24-hour working server located anywhere. Then, if needing the information anywhere at any time, it is possible for the user to retrieve it from the server onto a mobile phone. At the same time, since the software for encoding/decoding the confidential information is downloaded from another server to the mobile telephone, it is possible to encode/decode the confidential information on the mobile telephone anywhere at any time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As a result, even in case of forgetting an ID or a password, the user can still obtain it through a personal identification number answering service with a mobile telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Although there still remain a single ID and a couple of passwords to be memorized, it is possible for the user, merely by memorizing or storing those ID and passwords as a minimum of confidential information, to obtain various IDs and passwords (personal identification codes) recorded in a confidential information file which is stored in a safe manner. Here, the above-mentioned single ID and one of the passwords are used in the user verification on the server side, while the other one of the passwords is relevant to an encryption key for use in encoding/decoding the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As will be described later, instead of verifying the user on the server side by using the ID and the password, the user verification can be performed on the mobile telephone side by using biometric information. This makes it possible for the user to select what type of biometric information to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> It is also possible, as will also be described later, to send the password and the ID, contained in the down loaded confidential information file, from the mobile telephone to various devices and computer systems via a radio interface (Bluetooth&trade;, etc.) for logging-in to such devices and systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Further, a radio token, which is carried by the user, is prepared as a separate device for activating a password transmitting function of the mobile telephone. If the user (radio token) moves away from the mobile telephone so that it receives no response from the token, the confidential information file temporally held on the mobile telephone is deleted. Alternatively, with the lapse of a predetermined period, the downloaded confidential information file can be deleted automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> One preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the relevant accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;1&rsqb; Construction and function of the confidential information management system of the present embodiment: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A description will be made on the construction and the function of a confidential information management system according to the present embodiment, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a schematic of the confidential information management system. It includes a confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stores and manages confidential information files, which contain various confidential information and/or confidential execution programs, each in an encoded form, encoded with use of predetermined encoding software and a predetermined encryption key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores and manages the encoding/decoding software which is used in encoding/decoding the confidential information files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The directory server (access managing server) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> manages access attempts of a user from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to both the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by verifying the user. After verifying the user based on the information received from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> allows the user to access the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> functions as a secure server for providing a secure environment in communications between the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this instance, at the transmission of the information (ID, password, or biometric information) to be used in user verification by the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> prevents the information from being revealed so that the security of the information is guaranteed, and therefore the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be disposed at least between the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The mobile telephone (information terminal) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is capable of having access to both the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via a communications network (the Internet, etc.) and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and has an environment in which the encoding/decoding software is operated. A detailed description of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will be made later with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As will be described later with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, upon an access attempt of a user from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> verifies the user, and a confidential information file and encoding/decoding software are then downloaded from the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively, via a communications network and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. After that, the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> decodes the downloaded confidential information file by using predetermined decoding software and a predetermined encryption key. Here, the encoding/decoding software can be directly downloaded to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, without passing though the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, or without being protected by SSL (indicated with a double dots-dash line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), if the user so wishes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> If any change or addition has been made to the contents of the encoded confidential information file on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), or if a new confidential information file is intended to be stored in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>), such a file is encoded by predetermined encoding software and a predetermined encryption key on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> before being uploaded to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via a communications network and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Further, the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores more than one type of encoding/decoding software so as to be downloaded to the information terminal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The information terminal <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> downloads a suitable one of such plural types of encoding/decoding software at a fixed time interval, and alters an encoding system currently used in the confidential information file stored in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into another encoding system that is offered by the downloaded encoding/decoding software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In this manner, such plural types of encoding/decoding software improve the security level of the present confidential information management system. Each user can use plural types of encoding/decoding software, and such encoding/decoding software can be stored in advance in a storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As a matter of course, the encoding/decoding software downloaded from the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> corresponds to the encoding software that was used in encoding the confidential information file at its storing in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, a set of encoding software and decoding software is called &ldquo;encoding/decoding software&rdquo;. If any change has been made to the downloaded confidential information file on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the confidential information file needs to be encoded by encoding software. A piece of encoding software and a piece of decoding software are thus downloaded in combination, from the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As will be described later, the system (computer system) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is communicably connected with the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, receives an ID and a password (personal identification code) contained in the confidential information file that was encoded on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Further, the user purchases a prepaid card, and thereby obtains the information for use in the user verification performed by the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Specifically, at an initial contraction with a service (confidential information managing service) for providing the confidential information management system of the present embodiment, the user purchases a prepaid card and is given, in exchange, identification (ID) information and a password, both of which will authorize the user to access the confidential information management system. The anonymity of the user is thus protected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the user may otherwise obtain the user verification information required by the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> without purchasing the prepaid card at the initial contract. In this case, charges for the service may be paid into a bank account based on an anonymous contract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;2&rsqb; Construction and function of the mobile telephone (information terminal) of the present embodiment: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A description will now be made on the construction and the function of the mobile telephone (information terminal) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the present embodiment, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a schematic of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which includes a CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a communications unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, an interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and a biometric information sampling unit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is communicably interconnected with the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the other elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> via a bus <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Here, the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> stores a confidential information managing application for creating and changing a confidential information file, which application has been previously downloaded onto the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The confidential information managing application may always be stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, but with consideration paid to the capacity of the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the application may otherwise be downloaded to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when needed, as will be described later with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, being part of the confidential information management system of the present invention, at least includes the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the communications unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> further includes the interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the biometric information sampling unit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for the purpose of accomplishing various features as will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> manages and controls the operation of each of the above elements <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, constituting the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in a collective way. It also serves as a verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for verifying the user with use of a password or biometric information as required. Moreover, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> encodes/decodes the confidential information file with the use of a predetermined encryption key and encoding/decoding software downloaded to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The communications unit (communications means) <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> communicates with external apparatus, transmitting/receiving various signals and data. In the present embodiment, the communications unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> not only serves as a handset of a mobile telephone and a mobile terminal for an Internet connection, but also carries the following functions (a1) through (a3): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> (a1) a communications function for communicating with the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, transmitting/receiving various signals and data. This is actually realized by the above-mentioned Internet connection function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> (a2) an interface function for communicating with the system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and various devices in a wireless (Bluetooth&trade;, etc.) or a wired manner. In the transmission and receipt of various signals and data with the system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the above Internet connection function will be also utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> (a3) a communications function for communicating with a radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (described later), transmitting/receiving various signals and data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The storage unit (recording means, storing means) <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, is prepared, in use, as a RAM, a ROM, or the like, for recording/storing various data and various programs. The storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment not only stores a confidential information managing application, a confidential information file, and encoding/decoding software, having been downloaded to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, but also stores the following information (b1) through (b4) as necessary: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> (b1) information for use in user verification (an ID and passwords); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> (b2) information (an encryption key itself, or a text password for generating an encryption key; hereinafter will also be called &ldquo;encryption key information&rdquo;) with respect to an encryption key needed in encoding/decoding the confidential information file; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> (b3) the biometric information previously registered for use in its comparison with an object person&apos;s biometric information, in user verification carried out on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> (b4) a registered local password (described later under item (d6)) for use in user verification at the reading-out of a confidential information file from the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The password for use in user verification, described in the above item (b1) can serve as the registered local password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> If the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (described later) is used to input an ID and a password at the user verification, it is unnecessary to store the information (b1) in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. If the encryption key information is obtained from the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, or an external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, each to be described later, it is unnecessary to store the encryption key information (b2) in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. And, unless the biometric user verification is carried out on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, it is inevitably unnecessary to store the biometric information (b3) in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which is, say, a liquid crystal display, shows various data on its screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is for inputting numeral data and character data therethrough, just like those equipped to common types of mobile telephones. The keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is used, as needed, to input the following information (c1) through (c4): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> (c1) the information for use in user verification (an ID and passwords); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (c2) the encryption key information for use in encoding/decoding the confidential information file; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (c3) a local password (described later under item (d6)) for use in user verification at the reading-out of the confidential information file from the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (c4) a password for activating the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as will be described under item (e3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Here, the password for use in the user verification described in the above item (b1) and (c1), can serve as the passwords of the above item (c3) and (c4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> transfers data between the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the external storage medium (auxiliary storage medium) <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which is, in use, an IC card or a Smart Media, etc. In the present embodiment, the interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is used for putting the information relevant to an encryption key (an encryption key itself, or a text password for generating an encryption key), which information has previously been stored in the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, into the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In this instance, if the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is an IC card, the interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be either one of a contact type and a non-contact type; the former contacts with an IC card terminal for data transfer while the latter transfers the data in wireless. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The biometric information sampling unit (sampling means) <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> samples an object person&apos;s biometric information (physical characteristics such as fingerprint, palmprint, finger shape, hand shape, voiceprint, retina, iris, facial recognition, signature dynamics, blood vessel pattern, and key strokes, etc.), which is unique to the object person, when biometric user verification is performed by the verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), or by the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). At that time, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> also extracts biometric feature information from the sampled biometric information, for use in verifying the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> If the biometric information to be sampled is a fingerprint image, a fingerprint scanner is employed to serve as the biometric information sampling unit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. In use, there are such examples in the market as a CCD camera which takes a picture image of a fingertip while its being touched with a special optical system, and a capacitance sensor which detects only protuberant parts of the fingertip skin. At that time, as the biometric feature information, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extracts minutiae of the fingerprint ridges, namely, ridge dividing points and ridge end points, from the fingerprint image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In the above-described mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the contents of a confidential information file which was downloaded from the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and then encoded, is treated in the following manner (d1) through (d6): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> (d1) the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> instructs the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to show on its screen the contents of the confidential information file as they are (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> (d2) if a program (say, a confidential execution program) is included in the confidential information file, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> automatically executes the program (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> (d3) the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> instructs the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to show both system names (computer system names) and the confidential information associated with the system names, as the contents of the confidential information file (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Here, in concrete, the computer system names includes bank names, credit company names, and various device names; the system name-associated confidential information includes various IDs, such as account numbers, credit card numbers, and various device numbers, as well as IDs and personal identification codes (passwords) corresponding to the account numbers and the credit card numbers, and passwords having previously been set for the devices; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (d4) the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> instructs the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to show only the system names on its screen as the contents of the confidential information file. In response to a predetermined operation made by the user through the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> instructs the communications unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to transmit the confidential information (ID, password, or personal identification code) associated with an object system name, to a system whose name is identical with the object system name (namely, a server of a predetermined bank or a credit company, or a predetermined device itself) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). At this transmission, the interface function of the above item (a2), for example, can be utilized; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> (d5) with lapse of a predetermined time after the decoding of the confidential information file, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> deletes the confidential information file from the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> (d6) the contents of the decoded confidential information file is stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and upon completion of the user verification (using a local password or biometric information, etc.) by the verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(realized by the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> reads out the contents of the confidential information file stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and then instructs the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to show the readout information on its screen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment, with a radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which is carried by the user, for wirelessly communicating with the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> periodically, the following (e1) through (e4) are accomplished: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> (e1) the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> monitors periodical responses from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so that the confidential information file stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is deleted unless the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receives a periodic response from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. That is, the above functions (d1) through (d4) (the information contents display function of the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the password transmitting function of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, etc.) are activated by response signals periodically received from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> (e2) the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> previously holds encryption key information for use in decoding the confidential information file, and it also includes a function of transmitting the encryption key information to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, responsive to its request. When decoding the confidential information file, the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receives the encryption key information from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) ; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> (e3) the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the item (e2) is activated upon completion of the password verification performed on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. More precisely, if a predetermined password (the password mentioned in item (c4)) is input from the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> so as to activate the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> compares the input password with that (included in the above information (b1)) stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. If the two are found to be identical, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> instructs the communications unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to send a predetermined signal to the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> thereby activating the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so as to send the above-mentioned encryption key information to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> (e4) the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is given a unique ID number, while the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of item (e2) has a function of recognizing only this ID number. If an ID number the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> obtained during the communication with any mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is found to be identical with the above unique ID number, the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> transmits the above encryption key information to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The encryption key information (an encryption key itself, or a text password for generating an encryption key) for use in decoding the confidential information file, is input to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>) in ways described hereinbelow ((f1) through (f6)): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> (f1) the user manually inputs the encryption key through the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> (f2) the encryption key is converted into text so as to be input to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>), just like a password. In other words, in the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, decoding software generates an encryption key from a predetermined text password which was input from the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> (f3) if the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is an auxiliary storage medium such as a smart medium, the encryption key is read out from the auxiliary storage medium inserted into the body of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. That is, the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> storing the encryption key information is mounted on the interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, via which interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> the encryption key information is read out and then input to the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> (f4) in the above (f3), the encryption key information stored in the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be protected by a password. Like in the above item (e3), if a predetermined password (the password (c3)) is input from the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> for reading out the encryption key information from the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> compares the input password with that (included in the information (b1)) stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. If the two are identical, the encryption key information is read out from the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> via the interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and then input to the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> (f5) if the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is an IC card, the encryption key information is stored in the IC card. The encryption key information is read out from the IC card via the interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in a non-contact manner or a contact manner, and then input to the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> (f6) as described in the above items (e2) through (e4), the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> holds the encryption key information, and if the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is located close enough to communicate with the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the encryption key information is wirelessly transmitted from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the communications unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and then input to the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Further, in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment, with use of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> above described, the following features (g1) and (g2) are also attained: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> (g1) the subscriber number of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which number is notified by a caller ID service, etc., is used as the ID information of the user, and thereby the user verification can be carried out by utilizing a call-back system of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> (g2) biometric user verification is performed on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and upon completion of the verification, it becomes possible to read out the user verification information (b1) or the encryption key information (b2) stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, thereby guaranteeing the security of such information (b1) and (b2) in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. That is, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extracts biometric feature information from an object person&apos;s biometric information, which information is input by the biometric information sampling unit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and the verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> then compares the thus extracted biometric feature information with that (b3) stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Upon completion of the user verification, the information (b1) and (b2) is read out from the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3&rsqb; Various procedures performed by the confidential information management system and the mobile telephone of the present embodiment: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> A description will now be made of various procedures performed by the confidential information management system and the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3-1&rsqb; First exemplary procedure for downloading confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a first example of a procedure for downloading the confidential information in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment. This is a basic procedure (steps A<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through A<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) for downloading the confidential information in the confidential information management system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the beginning, a user purchases a prepaid card when initially making a contract with the confidential information management system, thereby obtaining an ID and a password for use in the user verification performed at access attempt to the confidential information management system (step A<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) Using this ID and password, the user stores a confidential information file having been encoded (hereinafter also called &ldquo;encoded confidential information file&rdquo;) to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The procedure for uploading/storing a new confidential information file to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, will be described later with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Here, the confidential information file records both system names (computer system names) and confidential information, such as IDs and passwords, in association with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In order to view the contents of the confidential information file, the user makes an access request from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the Internet and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (also via exchanges or else, in practical use) (step A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). At that time, under a secure communication environment protected by the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the access request accompanied by the ID and the password (&ldquo;PASS&rdquo; in the drawings), which were provided at purchasing the prepaid card, is transmitted from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and thereby the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is permitted to log-in to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> verifies the user based on the ID and the password received from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Upon confirmation that the ID and the password are those issued to an existing prepaid card, and also that the amount left in the prepaid card is enough to pay a service charge (or management charge), the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> notifies the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of an access permission via the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and step A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). At the same time, the permission issuance to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is notified to the managing servers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which are under the control of the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of the access permission, the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transfers encoding/decoding software of the same type as that used in encoding the confidential information file, to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step A<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and step A<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). At almost the same time, the encoded confidential information file is downloaded from the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step A<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and step A<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> After that, the decoding software is activated on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and an encryption key is input following one of the above-described manners (f1) through (f6) (step A<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). Using this decoding software and encryption key, the confidential information file having been downloaded in an encoded form is decoded on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step A<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) After completion of the decoding, the system names and the IDs/passwords are shown on the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for the user&apos;s review with a compact browser, as previously described in items (d1) and (d3), or they are transmitted from the communications unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (a bank server, an object device, etc.) with use of the radio communication function (Bluetooth&trade;, etc.) (step A<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), as described in item (d4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> After that, the decoded confidential information file is deleted, in view of its security, on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step A<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). In this instance, the deletion may be manually operated by the user, or as described in item (d5), the confidential information file may otherwise be deleted from the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> automatically with lapse of a predetermined period. Or else, as described in item (d6), the confidential information file may be held on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>) for a while, under access control with a local personal identification code. The downloading procedure to which the above item (d5) is applied will be described later with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3-2&rsqb; Second exemplary procedure for downloading confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a second example of the procedure for downloading the confidential information in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment. The procedure (step B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step B<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is common to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, with the exception that not a password but the biometric information is used in the user verification on the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> A user purchases a prepaid card at initially making a contract with the confidential information management system, thereby obtaining an ID and a password for use in user verification at accessing the confidential information management system. In association with the ID, the user&apos;s biometric feature information is stored in the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>). Using this ID and biometric feature information, the user stores an encoded confidential information file to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As in the above first example, the confidential information file records both system names (computer system names) and confidential information, such as IDs and passwords, in association with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In order to view the contents of the confidential information file, the user makes an access request from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via the Internet and SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (also via exchanges or else, in practical use) (step B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> At that time, on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the user inputs his/her biometric information (a fingerprint image, for example) through the biometric information sampling unit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and from this information the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extracts biometric feature information (minutiae of fingerprint ridges, etc.). Under a secure communication environment protected by the SSL server, the access request accompanied by both the ID, which was provided at purchasing the prepaid card, and the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>-extracted biometric feature information, is transmitted from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and thereby the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is permitted to log-in to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> verifies the user based on the ID and the biometric feature information, which are received from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. More precisely, upon receipt of the ID, the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> reads out the ID-associated biometric feature information having been previously stored therein. The directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then compares the thus readout biometric feature information with an object person&apos;s biometric feature information received from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Upon confirmation that the biometric feature information received from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is identical with an authorized user&apos;s, and also that the amount left on the prepaid card is enough to pay a service charge (or management charge), the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> notifies the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of an access permission via the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step B<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and step B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). At the same time, the permission issuance to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is notified to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which are under control of the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The procedure from step B<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through step B<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is the same as that from step A<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through step A<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, so its detailed description is omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the following items &lsqb;3-3&rsqb; through &lsqb;3-5&rsqb;, a description will be made, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, on the procedure (first, second, and third example) carried out on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> onto which the confidential information file and the encoding/decoding software were downloaded following the procedure (step A<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step A<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or step B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step B<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3-3&rsqb; First exemplary procedure executed on a mobile telephone for downloading confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the flowchart (step C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through step C<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> description will now be made on a first example of the procedure carried out on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for downloading the confidential information. Here, as described in item (g2), the encryption key has been stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and is protected by the biometric information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In such a case, when a confidential information file and encoding/decoding software are downloaded to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> starts up the downloaded decoding software (step C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The user inputs his/her biometric information (a fingerprint image, for example) through the biometric information sampling unit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and from this information the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extracts biometric feature information (minutiae of the fingerprint ridges, etc.) (step C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> compares the biometric feature information thus extracted in step C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the biometric feature information which has previously been registered/stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (see item (b3)), thereby verifying the user (step C<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). As the result, an object person is decided to be an authorized user, an encryption key is readout from the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (step C<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Using the encryption key thus read out in step C<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the decoding software, which has already been started up, decodes the encoded confidential information file (step C<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the decoding, the contents of the decoded confidential information file are shown on the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The user reviews the contents of the file using a compact browser or the like (step C<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>), and then the confidential information file is deleted on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step C<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3-4&rsqb; Second exemplary procedure executed on a mobile telephone for downloading confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the flowchart (step D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through step D<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> description will now be made on a second example of the procedure, carried out on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, for downloading the confidential information. In this example, an encryption key is input as a text password, and the above items (d5) and (d6) are also applied to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In such a case, when the confidential information file and the encoding/decoding software are downloaded to mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> starts up the downloaded decoding software (step D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), and then a text password (encryption key information) is input to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> following one of the above-described ways (f1) through (f5) (step D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> After that, the decoding software generates an encryption key from the text password thus input in step D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (step D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). Using this encryption key, the confidential information file is decoded (step D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the decoding, the contents of the decoded confidential information file are shown on the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The user views the contents of the file using a compact browser or the like (step D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), and then the confidential information file is closed for the present and stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (step D<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). At this time, the confidential information file is protected by a local password; the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> switches into a browse-prohibited mode, where no one is allowed to view the confidential information file unless the precise local password is input thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> After that, CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> uses its timer function to measure an elapsed time period, and evaluates whether or not a predetermined time duration is elapsed (step D<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). If the evaluation yields a negative result (NO route in step D<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), the confidential information file still remains in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (step D<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> If the local password (see item (c3)) is input through the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (YES route in step D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) while the confidential information file is being stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> compares the local password with a user identification-dedicated local password (see item (b4)), which has previously been registered/stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, thereby carrying out the user verification (step D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> As the result, an object person to be verified is an authorized user (YES route in step D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> switches from the browse-prohibitedmode to a browse-permitted mode (step D<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>), and then returns to step D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Otherwise if it is decided that the object person is not an authorized user (NO route in step D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shows an error notification (step D<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and maintains the browse-prohibited mode. The procedure then returns to step D<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In this instance, with no local password being input thereto (NO route in step D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of course maintains the browse-prohibited mode (step D<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) and returns to step D<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Upon detection, by the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, of the lapse of a predetermined period (YES route of step D<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), the confidential information file is deleted from the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (step D<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

In this example, an encryption key is input as a text password, and the above items (e1), (e2), and (f6) are also applied to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In this case, when the confidential information file and the encoding/decoding software are downloaded to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> starts up the downloaded decoding software (step E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), and then a text password (encryption key information) is input to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> following the above-described way (f6) (step E<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). That is, the text password has previously been stored in the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which is carried by the user, such that, if the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is close enough to communicate with the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the encryption key information is wirelessly sent from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the communications unit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and then input to the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The decoding software then generates an encryption key from the text password, which is input in step E<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (step E<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) Using this encryption key, the confidential information file is decoded (step E<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) Upon completion of the decoding, the contents of the decoded confidential information file are shown on the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The user views the contents of the file using a compact browser or the like (step E<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), and then the confidential information file is closed for the present and stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (step E<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> After that, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> uses its timer function to monitor whether or not a response reaches from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> within a predetermined period (step E<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). If the monitoring yields a positive result (YES route in step E<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), the confidential information still remains in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (step E<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> While the confidential information file remains in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> monitors whether or not a response reaches from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> continuously (step E<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). If the monitoring yields a positive result (YES route in step E<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> moves into the browse-permitted mode (step E<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), and then the procedure returns to step E<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Otherwise if the monitoring yields a negative result (NO route in step E<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> moves into the browse-prohibited mode (step E<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) and then the procedure returns to step E<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In other words, while the confidential information file is being stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> switches into the browse-permitted mode if the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are close enough to communicate with one another. Otherwise the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> switches into the browse-prohibited mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> If an instruction to show the confidential information file is input during the browse-permitted mode, mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> moves to step E<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> And, if the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> recognizes that no response is received from radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in a predetermined period (NO route of step E<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>), the confidential information file is deleted in storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (step E<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). In other words, if radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> stays outside an area where it is communicable with mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, for a predetermined period or longer, the confidential information file is deleted on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3-6&rsqb; Third exemplary procedure for downloading confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a third example of the procedure for downloading the confidential information in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment. The procedure (step F<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step F<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is basically common to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and in this example, the confidential information file contains a confidential execution program (confidential information execution software, confidential information execution file) as well as the confidential information itself such as IDs and passwords. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The procedures of step F<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step F<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are approximately the same as those of step A<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step A<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, respectively, with the exception of step F<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, after the encoded confidential information file is decoded on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> following the step F<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through F<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step A<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through A<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is switched into a confidential information browse-permitted mode, and CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> starts up a confidential information execution program, or the access software to the security server <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (step F<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) After that, as in step A<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the confidential information file is deleted for security on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step F<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3-7&rsqb; Procedure for updating confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a procedure for updating confidential information in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment. This procedure (step G<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step G<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is for changing/updating the contents of an encoded confidential information file stored in confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A description will be made hereinbelow, of a situation where an additional piece of confidential information (ID/password) for another computer system is added to the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the encoded confidential information file is decoded on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in such a manner as that described in step G<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step G<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step A<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through A<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Onto this decoded file, another ID and password are added/recorded through the keyboard <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (step G<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The thus updated confidential information file is encoded once again by the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with the decoding software downloaded in step G<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and step G<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and with a predetermined encryption key (step G<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), and is then uploaded from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step G<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and step G<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). As in step A<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the confidential information file left on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is deleted for security purposes (step G<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> In the above example, the procedure is used for adding a piece of confidential information for another computer system, and the above procedure can also be used for making some changes to any existing piece of confidential information (ID/password) stored in the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The reason why the updating (adding/changing) of the confidential information file should be performed on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is that, if such updating is carried out on confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the confidential information file must once be converted into plain text in confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby impairing the security of the confidential information. The role of the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is merely to provide an encoded confidential information file anytime and anywhere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3-8&rsqb; First exemplary procedure for newly uploading confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> are a diagram (step H<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step H<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) and a flowchart (step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) respectively, each showing a first example of a procedure for newly uploading a confidential information file in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment. In this example, a user makes a confidential information file (spreadsheet) of his/her own, and uploads the file onto the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in the user-dedicated home directory previously prepared therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> As shown in step A<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the user purchases a prepaid card when initially making a contract with the confidential information management system, and is given, in exchange, an ID and a password for use in the user verification performed at accessing the confidential information management system (step H<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Prior to the issuance of the prepaid card, an account and a password are set for the user in the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), and a user account and a user directory (each user-dedicated home directory) are also set on the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The user issues a download request from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and downloads the encoding/decoding software therefrom to mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet and SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> After that, the user prepares a confidential information file (spreadsheet) in which various confidential information is recorded (step H<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), and the confidential information file is then encoded by CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with the downloaded encoding software and a predetermined encryption key (step H<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). This encryption key is stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, or the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, directly or after being converted into a text password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Next, from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the user requests the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to permit the user&apos;s accessing the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step H<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and step H<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). At that time, under a secure communication environment protected by the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the access request accompanied by the ID and the password, which were provided at purchasing the prepaid card, is transmitted from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and thereby the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is permitted to log-in to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step H<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and step H<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> verifies the user based on the ID and the password received from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Upon confirmation that the ID and the password are those already issued to an existing prepaid card, and also that the amount left on the prepaid card is enough to pay a service charge (or management charge), the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> notifies the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of an access permission via the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step H<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and step H<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). At the same time, the permission issuance to mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is notified to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is under control of the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of the access permission, the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> accesses the home directory prepared on the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), and then uploads the confidential information file encoded in step H<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) onto the user-dedicated home directory which has been prepared for the user previously in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step H<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and step H<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). After that, the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> logs-out from the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). The confidential information file left on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is deleted for security purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;3-9&rsqb; Second exemplary procedure for newly uploading confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> are a diagram (step J<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step J<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and a flowchart (step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>), respectively, each showing a second example of a procedure for newly uploading a confidential information file in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment. In this example, the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> manages not only the encoding/decoding software but also a confidential information managing application and a confidential information file (spreadsheet, file sheet) that is in an original form, and provides these to mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> In this second example, like in the first example, the user purchases a prepaid card when initially making a contract with the confidential information management system, and is given, in exchange, an ID and a password for use in the user verification performed at accessing the confidential information management system (step J<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Prior to the issuance of the prepaid card, the procedure of steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the first example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is also carried out here in the second example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Then the user issues a download request from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and downloads the confidential information managing application and the confidential information file in an original form, to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step J<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Using the confidential information managing application on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the user records some confidential information in the downloaded confidential information file (spreadsheet) (step J<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> The user then issues a download request from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and downloads the encoding/decoding software therefrom to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step J<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and step J<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> After that, the confidential information file to which the confidential information is recorded in step J<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), is then encoded by the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with the downloaded encoding software and a predetermined encryption key (step J<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). This encryption key is stored in storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, or the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, directly or after being converted into a text password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The remainder of the procedure, from step J<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through step J<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and from step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, is the same as that from step H<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through step H<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and from step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so its detailed description is omitted here. In short, like in the first example (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), the confidential information file encoded in step J<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) is uploaded onto the user-dedicated home directory which has been prepared for the user previously in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> In the second example, the confidential information managing application and the encoding/decoding software are separately downloaded from the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result, any mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a small memory capacity is also applicable to the present confidential information management system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> If the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a memory (storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>) of a sufficient capacity, the above two pieces of software can be downloaded from the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> simultaneously. Moreover, the confidential information managing application and the encoding/decoding software maybe combined together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-10&rsqb; Third exemplary procedure for newly uploading confidential information: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> are a diagram (step K<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through step K<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and a flowchart (step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>), respectively, each showing a third example of the procedure for newly uploading a confidential information file in the confidential information management system of the present embodiment. In this example, the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> manages a confidential information managing application and a confidential information file (spreadsheet, file sheet) that is in an original form, and provides these to mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> In this third example, also, the user purchases a prepaid card when initially making a contract with the confidential information management system, and obtains an ID and a password, in exchange, for use in the user verification performed at accessing the confidential information management system (step K<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Prior to the issuance of the prepaid card, the procedure of steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the first example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is also carried out here in the third example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Next, from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the user requests the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to permit the user&apos;s accessing the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). At that time, under a secure communication environment protected by the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the access request accompanied by the ID and the password, which were provided at purchasing the prepaid card, is transmitted from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and thereby the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is permitted to log-in to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (step K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and step K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> The directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> verifies the user based on the ID and the password received from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Upon confirmation that the ID and the password are those already issued to an existing prepaid card, and also that the amount left in the prepaid card is enough to pay a service charge (or management charge), the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> notifies the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of an access permission via the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and step K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). At the same time, the permission issuance to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is notified to the managing servers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which are under control of the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Upon receipt of the access permission, the user accesses the home directory prepared on the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>), and then the user issues a download request from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and downloads the confidential information managing application and the confidential information file in an original form, to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step K<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and step K<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Using the confidential information managing application on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the user records some confidential information in the downloaded confidential information file (spreadsheet) (step K<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> The user then issues a download request from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the encoding/decoding software managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and downloads the encoding/decoding software therefrom to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the Internet and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step K<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and step K<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> After that, the confidential information file to which the confidential information is recorded in step K<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>), is then encoded by CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with the downloaded encoding software and a predetermined encryption key (step K<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). This encryption key is stored in storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, or the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, directly or after being converted into a text password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The confidential information file thus encoded in step K<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>) is then uploaded onto the user-dedicated home directory, which has been prepared for the user previously in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, via the Internet and the SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (step K<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and step K<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and step S<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). And, the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> logs-out from the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). The confidential information left on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is deleted for security purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> In this instance, the confidential information managing application and the confidential information file in its original form maybe put either in the user-dedicated home directory which has been previously prepared on the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or on the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4&rsqb; Effects of the present embodiment: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> The confidential information management system and the mobile telephone (information terminal) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the present invention guarantee the following advantageous results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-1&rsqb; Since confidential information files containing various confidential information or confidential executing programs, which files are securely stored in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, are obtained in a safe manner anywhere at any time using a minimum of confidential information (a single ID and a couple of passwords, or biometric feature information), it is possible to free users from memorizing or taking notes of numerous passwords or personal identification codes, thereby resolving various problems relevant to the management and the securing of confidential information files. In addition, even if such passwords or personal identification codes are made up of a string of characters that is difficult to memorize, it is possible to obtain the passwords or the personal identification codes in a safe manner anywhere at any time, as well as to store the passwords or the personal identification codes securely. The use of easy passwords or personal identification codes vulnerable to abuse can thus be prevented, thereby significantly improving the security level of the user verification system that employs password verification. Accordingly, the present invention provides effective and secure use of a general type of password verification without using a single-sign-on system or any other system, nor making any changes to existing user verification infrastructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-2&rsqb; Since such a confidential information file is stored in confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an encoded form, it cannot be decoded without using a type of decoding software corresponding to the encoding software by which the confidential information file has been encoded. It is thus possible to prevent an administrator of the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from misusing the confidential information files, and also, even if a confidential information file should be intercepted or leaked, a third party cannot see the contents of the confidential information file, thereby guaranteeing a high level of security (safety). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-3&rsqb; Since the confidential information files are encoded, the security of a one-to-one communication between the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be retained, thus facilitating the construction of the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and confidential information systems that require a high level of security. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-4&rsqb; The encoding/decoding software can be downloaded from a dedicated purpose server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. So, provided most mobile telephones are associated with the present confidential information managing system, it is possible for the user to use another person&apos;s mobile telephone for browsing or making changes to his/her confidential information file in a safe manner even when the user does not carry a mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of his/her own. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-5&rsqb; Since the confidential information file containing passwords and personal identification codes can be obtained anywhere at any time with use of the present confidential information management system and the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, it is possible to significantly reduce the maintenance cost (total cost of ownership: TCO) of the systems which employ the password verification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-6&rsqb; If applied to the systems employing PKI verification, the confidential information management system and mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment surely prevent an encryption key for PKI (public key infrastructure) from being made invalid due to inadvertent handling. It is thus possible to prevent a list of invalid digital certificates from becoming too big. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-7&rsqb; Since the confidential information file is transmitted between each mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the confidential information managing server, which are connected in a one-to-one relationship, it is possible to employ biometric information-utilized user verification with ease to verify the user who intends to access a confidential information file stored in the server. Further, user verification using two or more types of biometric information is also facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-8&rsqb; Since the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> performs the user verification collectively, it is possible to manage access attempts of the user from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to each managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, under centralized control by the access managing server. Each managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is thus rendered free from making user verification separately, thereby simplifying the processing carried out by each managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-9&rsqb; Since the use of SSL server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> guarantees the security of the above-mentioned minimal confidential information (a single ID and a couple of passwords), which is transmitted from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the directory server <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an improved security level is realized in the confidential information managing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-10&rsqb; As described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, since anew confidential information file or a confidential information file to which any change has been made is encoded on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> before being sent to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be stored therein, it is possible to realize a sufficient level of security of the confidential information even if communication between the confidential information managing server and the information terminal does not comply with the security features of SSL. Mobile telephones commonly distributed in the market are thus applicable to the confidential information managing system of the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-11&rsqb; As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, if any addition or changes are made, on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, to the confidential information file such as a spreadsheet and a data base, the confidential information file is encoded before being sent to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and thereby the user makes some addition or changes to the contents of the confidential information file with significant ease. Likewise, as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, when a new piece of confidential information is written in a confidential information file, such as a spreadsheet and a data base, on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the new confidential information file is encoded before being sent to the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby making it significantly easy for the user to register/store a new confidential information file in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-12&rsqb; As described in item (d1) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, since the contents of the encoded confidential information file is shown on the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, it is possible for the user to view the contents immediately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-13&rsqb; As described in item (d3) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, since both computer system names (bank names, credit company names, device names) and the confidential information (IDs, passwords, personal identification codes, etc.) associated with each of the computer system names are shown on display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, it is possible to input the required information to a computer system whose name is identical with the computer system name shown on the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-14&rsqb; As described in item (d4) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, only the computer system names may be shown on display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Referring to those computer system names on display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the user specifies one of them with predetermined key operations. The confidential information associated with the user-specified computer system name is sent to a computer system (a server of a bank or a credit company, or various devices) whose name is identical with the computer system name. As a result, the confidential information itself is no longer shown on the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, thereby further improving the security of the confidential information. At the same time, since the user is freed from inputting the confidential information with some key operations, the operation to be made by the user is simplified and unscrupulous viewing and abuse by third parties of confidential information input by the user is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-15&rsqb; As described in item (d5) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, with the lapse of a predetermined time after completion of the decoding of the confidential information file, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> automatically deletes the decoded confidential information file stored in storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Therefore, there is no possibility of the confidential information file held in the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> being stolen by a third party, thereby guaranteeing improved security of the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-16&rsqb; As described in item (d6) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the contents of the decoded confidential information file stored in storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are shown on display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> upon completion of the user verification made by the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> (verifying means <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the contents of the confidential information file are securely stored in storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, while only an authorized user is allowed to show the contents on the display <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-17&rsqb; As described in item (d<highlight><italic><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight></italic></highlight>) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, upon the decoding of the confidential information file, a program (confidential execution program, etc.) contained in the decoded confidential information file is executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and thus it is possible for mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to automatically move to the operation instructed by that program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-18&rsqb; As described in item (e1) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which is carried by the user, wirelessly communicates with mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> periodically so that the decoded confidential information file is deleted on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> unless the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receives a periodic response from the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. It is thus possible to delete the confidential information file stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> automatically, if the user with the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is apart from the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, or if the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is stolen away from the user, thereby preventing the confidential information file from being stolen by a third party and thus guaranteeing improved security of the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-19&rsqb; As described in item (e2) and item (f6) the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> holds the encryption key information, and sends the information to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on a request from mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It is thus possible only for a user who carries a radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to decode the confidential information file with use of the encoding/decoding software, and it is no longer necessary to take notes of the encryption key information nor to store such information in a memory of any information device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-20&rsqb; As described in item (e3), the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is activated in response to the user verification with a password on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and also, as described in item (e4), the radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> sends the encryption key information to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> only when it detects a predetermined ID number of mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It is thus possible to securely store the encryption key information in radio token <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-21&rsqb; As described in item (f2), since the encryption key for use in decoding the confidential information file is generated from a predetermined text password that is input by the authorized user to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, it is possible to input the encryption key to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a kind of password. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-22&rsqb; As described in item (f3) through item (f5), since the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes the interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that holds the encryption key information, it is possible to input the encryption key information from the external storage medium <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> via the interface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. This would free the user from inputting the encryption key information by herself/himself, thereby simplifying user operation, and also preventing the encryption key information input by the user from being unscrupulously viewed and abused by a third party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-23&rsqb; Since mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> downloads a suitable one of the plural types of encoding/decoding software stored in the managing server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a fixed time interval, and periodically alters an encoding system currently used in the confidential information file stored in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into another that is offered by the downloaded encoding/decoding software, it is possible to guarantee an improved level of security of the confidential information file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-24&rsqb; Since the user obtains an ID (identification information) and a password, which authorize the user to access the confidential information management system, by purchasing a prepaid card, it is possible to protect the user&apos;s anonymity with respect to the confidential information management system. That is, it cannot be identified which one of the files stored in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> belongs to whom, thereby preventing misuse of such confidential information files. Moreover, the prepaid cards are convenient to collect charges (management charges) for use of the confidential information management system, in advance, at the time of issuance of IDs and passwords. In the meantime, the charges may be paid into a bank account based on an anonymous contract. Also in this case, since it cannot be identified which one of the confidential information files stored in the confidential information managing server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> belongs to whom, the misuse of the encoded confidential information file can be effectively prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-25&rsqb; Since each of the information terminals is a mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which is connectable to the Internet, it is possible to download a confidential information file anywhere at any time over the Internet. At that time, if the subscriber number of the mobile telephone is used as the user&apos;s ID information, as described in item (g1),it is possible to employ a call-back system of mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to verify the user. Moreover, since the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can connect with the Internet immediately after the power is turned on, it is possible to view the confidential information (IDs, passwords, etc.) more promptly on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> than on a personal computer, which normally takes a relatively long time to start up and then connect with the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-26&rsqb; As described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, since biometric information is used in the user verification, it is no longer necessary for the user to input a password for downloading the confidential information file, and the security level of the confidential information file is also improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-27&rsqb; As described in item (g2) with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the biometric information-utilized user verification is performed on the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and upon completion of the user verification, the information for verifying the user (b1) and the encryption key information (b2) are read out from the storage unit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. It is thus possible to store and manage such information (b1) and (b2) securely on mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;4-28&rsqb; At that time, since the biometric user verification can be carried out separately for individual users (for each mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), it is possible to employ the biometric user verification without making any changes to existing user verification infrastructures. And also, since the type of biometric information to be used in the verification is selected by the user on his/her own, that most convenient to the user can be selected. Moreover, if voice print is selected, since a digital signal processor of the mobile telephone <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be used, the user verification can be carried out offline. Accordingly, it is possible to avoid a failure of verification caused by voice compression encountered at an online verification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;5&rsqb; Other Modifications: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention should by no means be limited to the above-illustrated embodiment, but various changes or modifications may be suggested without departing from the gist of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> For example, in the above description, the information terminal is an Internet-connectable mobile telephone. Any network-connectable information terminal, which can receive the above-described confidential information management service, is also applicable to the present invention, and it guarantees like effects to those described in the above embodiment. Concrete examples of such information terminals are, say, PDAs, IC cards having a radio communication function, notebook computers, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the above-embodiment, the confidential information files, the encoding/decoding software, and the confidential information management application can be produced with use of general-purpose software created (programmed) in JAVA, so that they can then run on a variety of types of mobile telephones. </paragraph>
