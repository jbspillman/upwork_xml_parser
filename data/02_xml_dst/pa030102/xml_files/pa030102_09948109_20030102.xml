<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In the present invention, a system and method is described for allocating portfolio assets in an emerging market, where the portfolio initially includes substantially all fixed income securities or substantially all equities. Specifically, a yield spread is periodically determining between a first fixed income instrument and a second fixed income instrument. A mean spread is determined based on the determined yield spread over a selected period of time. A band above and below the mean spread is defined over the selected period of time, where the band has an upper limit above the mean spread and a lower limit below the mean spread. Fixed income securities, in the investment portfolio, are switched for equities when a current determined yield spread exceeds the upper limit of the band. Similarly, equities, in the portfolio, are switched for fixed income securities when the current determined yield spread falls below the lower limit of the band. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the management of an investment portfolio made up of financial instruments. In particular, the present invention relates to a method for allocating assets in such an investment portfolio between equities (e.g., stocks) and fixed income securities (e.g., sovereign bonds) of an emerging market country. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Emerging markets are defined as the financial markets of developing economies. Approximately 45 countries are classified as emerging markets. For example, emerging markets are found in regions such as Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Mexico, Peru, etc.), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Hungary, Poland, Russia, etc.), the Mideast (Israel, Turkey, etc.), Asia (China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.), and Africa (Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, etc.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Improved government and market-oriented management in such emerging countries are expected to provide economic benefits over the long term. Such benefits include long-term economic growth in a non-hyper-inflationary environment, and a strong demand for goods and services from an under-served and growing population. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, recent experiences regarding the management of equities (e.g., common stocks) and fixed income (e.g., bonds, preferred stock or debt) instruments of emerging countries are somewhat inconsistent with the above described long term expectations and goals. This inconsistency occurs for many reasons. For example, economic and political developments do not follow a linear process. Further, &ldquo;growing pains&rdquo; have translated into significant economic and financial market volatility. In addition, traditional equity and fixed-income vehicles have not performed as would have been hoped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, the fundamental themes for investing in emerging markets remain intact. However, investors would best be served by an investment vehicle that exploits the most desirable characteristics of both fixed income instruments and equity instruments. Such characteristics include strong capital appreciation potential of equities in a &ldquo;benign&rdquo; or stable environment, and defensive attributes of local and foreign currency bond instruments in a &ldquo;hostile&rdquo; or risky environment. A balanced product also provides access to a greater variety of markets than would be available with bond or equity vehicles alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of investing in the equities and sovereign bonds of emerging countries. This method may further be applied to allocating investments between equities and sovereign bonds of individual countries in a fund comprised of the financial instruments of a plurality of emerging countries. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to add value primarily through asset allocation shifts between emerging market sovereign bonds and emerging market equities within individual countries. These asset allocation shifts are determined in the inventive method by changes in the sovereign yield spread over time. The sovereign yield spread is the spread (or difference in yield) in basis points between a U.S. Government bond and a selected benchmark dollar-denominated sovereign bond issued by the Government of an emerging market country. In the realm the bond market, a basis point (bps) is the smallest measure used for quoting yields. Each percentage point of yield in bonds equals 100 bps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the inventive method, the sovereign yield spread is measured over a rolling historical predetermined period in the range, e.g., of one to six months to determine a mean spread. Next, a band is defined above and below this mean by, e.g., 1 to 2 standard deviations, such as 1.7, 1.5, or 1.2 standard deviations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When the actual current yield spread of a particular benchmark sovereign bond surpasses the upper band, we define this as a &ldquo;hostile&rdquo; environment and the portfolio moves into fixed income securities in that particular country. Generally, widening yield spreads signal that investors perceive rising risk. When the actual current yield spread surpasses the lower band, we define this as a &ldquo;benign&rdquo; environment and the portfolio moves into equity in that particular country. Tightening yield spreads generally signal that investors have become more risk tolerant. When the actual current yield spread stays within the upper and lower band, the type of security (either fixed income or equities) remains unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, in any particular country, the asset allocation in each portfolio will be substantially 100% fixed income or substantially 100% equities. In the case of a fund made up of financial instruments of a group of emerging countries, the securities for each individual country will preferably be substantially 100% fixed income or substantially 100% equities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Within the emerging market equity universe, stocks may be chosen in accordance with established well-known methods that are currently being applied to global emerging market equity portfolios. Similarly, once a fixed income signal is given, securities may be chosen in accordance with existing security selection processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Such objects and advantages listed above are merely illustrative and not exhaustive. Further, these and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an asset allocation method of the present invention is schematically illustrated in a flow chart which represents a process that may be carried out by a digital computer such as the computer system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To utilize the method of the invention, a benchmark dollar denominated sovereign bond in a particular emerging market country is selected. For example, the so called &ldquo;C-Bond&rdquo; is Brazil&apos;s benchmark sovereign bond. The benchmark sovereign bond has a maturity of, for example, one year or three years. In addition, a U.S. Government bond, having a maturity comparable to that of the benchmark sovereign bond, is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the spread in market yield (i.e., the yield spread) between the U.S. Government bond and the benchmark sovereign bond is determined on a periodic basis (e.g. daily or weekly) in step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Illustratively, this determination is made by the computer system and memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in response to inputting the yields of the bonds, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. In step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the mean spread is determined over a rolling historical predetermined period. For example, the predetermined period may be in the range of one to six months, such as three months. A band is then defined above and below the mean. For example, the upper limit of the band is above the mean in the range of 1 to 2 standard deviations, such as 1.7, 1.5 or 1.2 standard deviations. The lower limit of the band is in the range of 1 to 2 standard deviations, such as 1.7, 1.5 or 1.2 standard deviations below the mean. The determination of the rolling mean spread and band limits are illustratively made by the computer system and memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Steps <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, as well as steps <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> describe the asset allocation decision. These steps may also be evaluated by computer system and memory <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which then outputs an investment allocation decision, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the invention, the portfolio for a particular country is preferably either substantially 100% fixed income securities (such as bonds) or substantially 100% equities (such as common stock). As indicated by steps <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, if the current spread exceeds the upper limit (i.e., is in a hostile environment) and the portfolio for the particular country consists of equities, a switch is made to fixed income instruments. Otherwise, no change is made. As indicated by steps <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>, if the current spread falls below the lower limit (i.e., is in a benign environment) and the portfolio consists of fixed income instruments, a switch is made to equities securities. Otherwise, no change is made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an example of the invention by way of a graph. The horizontal axis of the graph is time starting from a certain date, e.g. Mar. 16, 2000. The vertical axis of the graph is basis points. Curve A in the graph is the yield spread between the U.S. government bond and the benchmark sovereign bond plotted as a function of time, starting from Mar. 16, 2000. Curve B is the mean of the spread calculated over a rolling three-month historical period. Curve C is the upper limit of a band, 1.2 standard deviations above the mean. Curve D is the lower limit of the band, 1.2 standard deviations below the mean. Above curve C, the environment is &ldquo;hostile.&rdquo; Below curve D, the environment is &ldquo;benign.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Assume that the portfolio starts at time <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the spread is in a hostile environment. As the current spread is above the upper limit, the portfolio is set up with 100% fixed income securities. At point <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the current spread goes below the upper limit; however, no change in asset allocation is made (see step <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>). At point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the current spread goes below the lower limit and is in a benign environment. At this point, the portfolio allocation is switched to 100% equities (see step <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>). At point <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the spread goes into the band (see step <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>), and at point <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the spread goes below the band, but no change in asset allocation takes place (see step <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>). At point <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the current spread re-enters the hostile environment by crossing the upper limit. At this point, the asset allocation is switched back to 100% fixed income (see step <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the asset allocation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as either 100% equities or 100% fixed income securities as a function of time. As described above and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, at point <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the allocation is switched from 100% bonds to 100% stock. At point <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the allocation is switched back from 100% stock to 100% bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the inventive method (as exemplified by the foregoing) may be applied to the allocation of securities of each individual country in a fund comprised of securities from multiple emerging countries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Finally, it should be understood that the foregoing description is merely illustrative of the invention. Numerous alternative embodiments within the scope of the appended claims will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
