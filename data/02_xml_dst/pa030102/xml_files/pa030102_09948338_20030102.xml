<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A modular light emitting diode (LED) mounting configuration is provided including a light source module having a plurality of pre-packaged LEDs arranged in a serial array. The module includes a heat conductive body portion adapted to conduct heat generated by the LEDs to an adjacent heat sink. A heat conductive adhesive tape connects the LED module to the mount surface. As a result, the LEDs are able to be operated with a higher current than normally allowed. Thus, brightness and performance of the LEDs is increased without decreasing the life expectancy of the LEDs. A plurality of such LED modules can be pre-wired together in a substantially continuous fashion and provided in a dispenser, such as a roll or box. Thus, to install a plurality of such LED modules, a worker simply pulls modules from the dispenser as needed, secures the appropriate number of modules in place, and connects the assembled modules to a power source. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to light emitting diode (LED) lighting devices and more particularly to LED lighting modules having heat transfer properties that improve the efficiency and performance of LEDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Most lighting applications utilize incandescent or gas-filled bulbs, particularly lighting applications that require more than a low level of illumination. Such bulbs typically do not have long operating lifetimes and thus require frequent replacement. Gas-filled tubes, such as fluorescent or neon tubes, may have longer lifetimes, but operate using dangerously high voltages and are relatively expensive. Further, both bulbs and gas-filled tubes consume substantial amounts of power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In contrast, light emitting diodes (LEDs) are relatively inexpensive, operate at low voltage, and have long operating lifetimes. Additionally, LEDs consume relatively little power and are relatively compact. These attributes make LEDs particularly desirable and well suited for many applications. However, one limitation of LEDs is that they typically do not provide sufficient brightness for applications that need more than low level illumination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although it is known that the brightness of the light emitted by an LED can be increased by increasing the electrical current supplied to the LED, increased current also increases the junction temperature of the LED. Increased junction temperature may reduce the efficiency and the lifetime of the LED. For example, it has been noted that for every 10&deg; C. increase in temperature above a specified temperature, the operating lifetime of silicone and gallium arsenide drops by a factor of 2.5-3. LEDs are often constructed of semiconductor materials that share many similar properties with silicone and gallium arsenide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another factor in the use of LEDs is that, in most systems, a series of LEDs must be connected together and mounted on a surface. Such connection and mounting is typically a time consuming, laborious process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a convenient and efficient arrangement for mounting LEDs on a surface. There is also a need in the art for lighting systems utilizing LEDs that provide illumination at levels which are more comparable to those of incandescent bulbs and gas-filled tubes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> With reference first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a light-emitting diode (LED) lighting module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disclosed. In the illustrated embodiment, the LED module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes five pre-packaged LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> arranged along a front edge of the module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood, however, that LED modules can be constructed having any number of LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> mounted in any desired configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> With next reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> typical LED package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a diode chip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> encased within a resin body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The LED package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> typically has a focusing lens portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the body <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a pair of leads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, one of which is negative and the other positive. The negative lead <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> connects to an anode side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the diode chip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the positive lead <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> connects to a cathode side <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the diode chip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The positive lead <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> preferably includes a reflector portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to help direct light from the diode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the lens portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With next reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the LED module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably comprises the five pre-packaged LED lamps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> mounted in a linear array on a circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and electrically connected in series. The LED lamps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may comprise Hewlett Packard model HLMT-PL00 lamps, which employ pre-packaged aluminum indium gallium phosphide (AlInGaP) chips <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the pre-packaged LEDs is substantially identical so that they emit the same color of light. It is to be understood, however, that nonidentical LEDs may be used to achieve certain desired lighting effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The illustrated circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> preferably is about 0.05 inches thick, 1 inch long and 0.5 inch wide. It includes three layers: a copper contact layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, an epoxy dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and an aluminum main body layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The copper contact layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is made up of a series of six elongate and generally parallel flat copper plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that are adapted to attach to the leads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each of the copper contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is electrically insulated from the other copper contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the copper contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are substantially coplanar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The pre-packaged LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are attached to one side of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, with the body portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of each LED generally abutting a side of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The LED lens portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is thus pointed outwardly so as to direct light in a direction substantially coplanar with the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The LED leads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are soldered onto the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a manner to create a series array of LEDs. Excess material from the leads of the individual pre-packaged LED lamps may be removed, if desired. Each of the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, except for the first and last contact <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, have both a negative lead <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a positive lead <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> attached thereto. One of the first and last contacts <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has only a negative lead <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> attached thereto; the other has only a positive lead <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> attached thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A bonding area <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the contacts accommodates the leads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which are preferably bonded to the contact <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with solder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>; however, each contact <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably has a surface area much larger than is required for bonding in the bonding area <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The enlarged contact surface area allows each contact <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to operate as a heat sink, efficiently absorbing heat from the LED leads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. To maximize this role, the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are shaped to be as large as possible while still fitting upon the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> preferably has strong electrical insulation properties but also relatively high heat conductance properties, and is preferably as thin as practicable. For example in the illustrated embodiment, the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comprises a layer of Thermagon&reg; epoxy about 0.002 inches thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that various materials and thicknesses can be used for the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Generally, the lower the thermal conductivity of the material used for the dielectric layer, the thinner that dielectric layer should be in order to maximize the heat transfer properties of the module. Nevertheless, even when a material such as Thermagon&reg; epoxy, which has high thermal conductivity, is used, the dielectric layer is preferably as thin as practicable in order to minimize thermal resistance. Certain ceramic materials, such as beryllium oxide and aluminum nitride, are electrically non-conductive but highly thermally conductive. Such materials, and still other materials, can also be acceptably used for the dielectric layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the main body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> makes up the bulk of the thickness of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and preferably comprises a flat aluminum plate. As with each of the individual contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the main body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> functions as a heat conduit, absorbing heat from the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> through the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in order to conduct heat away from the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. However, rather than just absorbing heat from a single LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the main body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> acts as a common heat conduit, absorbing heat from all of the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As such, in the illustrated embodiment, the surface area of the main body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is about the same as the combined surface area of all of the individual contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The main body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be significantly larger than shown in the illustrated embodiment, but its relatively compact shape is preferable in order to increase versatility when mounting the light module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the main body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is relatively rigid and provides structural support for the lighting module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the main body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is made of aluminum, which has high thermal conductance properties and is easy to work with during manufacture. It is to be understood, however, that any material having advantageous thermal conductance properties, such as having thermal conductivity greater than about 100 watts per meter per Kelvin (W/m*K), would be acceptable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, a pair of holes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are formed through the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and are adapted to accommodate a pair of aluminum pop rivets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The pop rivets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> hold the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> securely onto a heat conductive mount member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The mount member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> functions as or communicates with a heat sink. Thus, heat from the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is conducted with relatively little resistance through the module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the attached heat sink <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> so that the junction temperature of the diode chip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> within the LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> does not exceed a maximum desired level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> With reference again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>, power supply wires <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are attached across the first and last contacts <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that electrical current is provided to the series-connected LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The power supply is preferably a 12-volt system and may be AC, DC or any other suitable power supply. A 12-volt AC system may be fully rectified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The small size of the LED module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides versatility so that a plurality of modules can be mounted at various places and in various configurations. For instance, some applications will include only a single module for a particular lighting application, while other lighting applications will employ a plurality of modules electrically connected in parallel relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is also to be understood that any number of LEDs can be included in one module. For example, some modules may use two LEDs, while other modules may use 10 or more LEDs. One manner of determining the number of LEDs to include in a single module is to first determine the desired operating voltage of a single LED of the module and also the voltage of the power supply. The number of LEDs desired for the module is then roughly equal to the voltage of the power supply divided by the operating voltage of each of the LEDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present LED module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> rapidly conducts heat away from the diode chip <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of each LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to permit the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be operated in regimes that exceed normal operating parameters of the pre-packaged LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In particular, the heat sinks allow the LED circuit to be driven in a continuous, non-pulsed manner at a higher long-term electrical current than is possible for typical LED mounting configurations. This operating current is substantially greater than manufacturer-recommended maximums. The optical emission of the LEDs at the higher current is also markedly greater than at manufacturer-suggested maximum currents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The heat transfer arrangement of the LED modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is especially advantageous for pre-packaged LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having relatively small packaging and for single-diode LED lamps. For instance, the HLMT-PL00 model LED lamps used in the illustrated embodiment employ only a single diode, but since heat can be drawn efficiently from that single diode through the leads and circuit board and into the heat sink, the diode can be run at a higher current than such LEDs are traditionally operated. At such a current, the single-diode LED shines brighter than many LED lamps that employ two or more diodes and which are brighter than a single-diode lamp during traditional operation. Of course, pre-packaged LED lamps having multiple diodes can also be advantageously employed with the present modular mounting arrangement. It is also to be understood that the relatively small packaging of the model HLMT-PL00 lamps aids in heat transfer by allowing the heat sink to be attached to the leads closer to the diode chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> With next reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> first reflective layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably attached immediately on top of the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is held in position by the rivets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The first reflector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> preferably extends outwardly beyond the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The reflective material preferably comprises an electrically non-conductive film such as visible mirror film, which is available from 3M. A second reflective layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the mount member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> at a point immediately adjacent the LED lamps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The second strip <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is preferably bonded to the mount surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> using adhesive in a manner known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> With reference also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the first reflective strip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably bent so as to form a convex reflective trough about the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The convex trough is adapted to direct light rays emitted by the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> outward with a minimum of reflections between the reflector strips <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Additionally, light from the LEDs is limited to being directed in a specified general direction by the reflecting films <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be mounted directly to any mount surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the aluminum main body portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be of reduced thickness or may be formed of a softer metal so that the module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be at least partially deformed by a user. In this manner, the module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to fit onto various surfaces, whether they are flat or curved. By being able to adjust the fit of the module to the surface, the shared contact surface between the main body and the adjacent heat sink mount surface is maximized, thus improving heat transfer properties. Additional embodiments can use fasteners other than rivets to hold the module into place on the mount surface/heat sink material. These additional fasteners can include any known fastening means such as welding, heat-conductive adhesives, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, a variety of materials can be used for the circuit board portion of the LED module. With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, another embodiment of an LED module <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> comprises a series of elongate, flat contacts <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> similar to those described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The contacts <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are mounted directly onto the main body portion <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. The main body <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> comprises a rigid, substantially flat ceramic plate. The ceramic plate makes up the bulk of the circuit board and provides structural support for the contacts <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Also, the ceramic plate has a surface area about the same as the combined surface area of the contacts. In this manner, the plate is large enough to provide structural support for the contacts <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and to conduct heat away from each of the contacts <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, but is small enough to allow the module <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to be relatively small and easy to work with. The ceramic plate <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is preferably electrically non-conductive but has high heat conductivity. Thus, the contacts <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are electrically insulated relative to each other, but heat from the contacts <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is readily transferred to the ceramic plate <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and into an adjacent heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> With next reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, another embodiment of an LED lighting module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is shown. The LED module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> comprises a circuit board <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> having features substantially similar to the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The diode portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of an LED <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is mounted substantially directly onto the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the lighting module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. In this manner, any thermal resistance from leads of pre-packaged LEDs is eliminated by transferring heat directly from the diode <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> onto each heat sink contact <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, from which the heat is conducted to the main body <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and then out of the module <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, heat transfer properties are yet further improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> With reference next to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, another embodiment of an LED module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. As with the LED module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> discussed above, the LED module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which includes a contact layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and a main body layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The contact layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a series of electrical traces and contacts, as will be discussed in further detail below. The dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> electrically insulates the traces and contacts relative to one another. The main body layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> provides support and helps thermally conduct heat away from the contact layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, which shows a plan view of the contact layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the contact layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> comprises a series of six contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which comprise elongate and generally parallel electrically conductive flat plates. Leads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of five LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> attach to the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so as to form a linear array of the five prepackaged LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which are arranged in series relative to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> First and second elongate power traces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> extend in a direction generally transverse to the parallel plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, but parallel to the series array. As with the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the power traces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprise conductive material, and are electrically insulated from each other and the contacts by the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Secondary connecting portions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are also provided adjacent first and second side edges <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The secondary connecting portions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are also electrically insulated from the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and power traces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A first connector trace <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> extends between the first contact <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a first end <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the first power trace <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A second connection trace <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> extends between the last contact <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the second power trace <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The connector traces <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> place their respective contacts <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into electrical communication with the corresponding power traces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a view similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, except that a thin mask layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is applied to selected portions of a top face <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing layers of the module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The masking layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> covers certain portions of the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and traces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. These covered portions are depicted in phantom lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Other portions of the contacts and traces are left uncovered in order to function as solder points so as to facilitate electrical connection with certain other components. The masking layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> fulfills an aesthetic function and also protects areas of the contacts that are not used for electrical connections from environmental factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, the mask layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> covers a portion of each of the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. However, each of the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a connecting area <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which is not covered and which accommodates the leads <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the associated LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A connecting portion <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of both the first and last contacts <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is also not covered by the mask layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The mask layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> covers portions of each power trace <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A first end connecting portion <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of each power trace <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is provided at the end closest to the first side edge <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a second end connecting portion <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of each power trace <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is provided at the end closest to the second side edge <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The mask layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> does not cover the power traces in the connecting portions <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. First and second flexible conductors such as wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>) can be connected to the connecting portions <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in order to supply power to the LED array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> With reference also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> layer of adhesive tape <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is attached to a bottom face <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the LED module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As shown, the tape <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> preferably extends across the bottom face <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and outwardly from the first and second opposing side edges <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, creating first and second flaps or ears <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the tape <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The tape <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> preferably is malleable and can be bent easily. A backing <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is provided on the tape <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The backing <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> can be peeled away to expose an adhesive layer, and the tape/module can be applied to a desired surface in a manner so that the module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is held securely in place on that surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A reflective layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is also preferably attached to the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The reflective layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably held onto the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by a strip of adhesive operating between the mask layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the reflective cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The reflective cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> preferably extends over the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a manner as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With next reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, the adhesive tape <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> secures a module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> onto either a flat or a curved surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. In the case of a curved surface, if the module cannot bend sufficiently to keep the module in continuous contact with the curved surface, the flaps or ears of the tape will still be able to securely attach the module onto the curved surface. Of course, it is to be understood that the tape layer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be provided with or without the ears <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, and that the ears can be of any desired size and shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the LED module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has good heat transfer properties. The adhesive tape <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> preferably has properties that complement the heat transfer properties of the module. In one embodiment, the tape <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> comprises an aluminum tape having a heat-conductive adhesive applied thereto. The aluminum tape is capable of conforming to a curving or undulating surface, and also efficiently transfers heat from the module to the surface onto which it is attached. This aspect proves especially valuable when the module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is affixed to a curving heat sink surface <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, and a large proportion of the module&apos;s circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> does not directly contact the curving surface. In such an instance, heat from the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> flows through the ears <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to the heat sink <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment, the LED module&apos;s main body is formed of a bendable material, which allows the module to fit more closely and easily to a curved wall surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, an LED module having features of the embodiments described above can be used in many applications such as, for example, indoor and outdoor decorative lighting, commercial lighting, spot lighting, and even room lighting. Such LED modules can also be used in applications using a plurality of such modules to appropriately light a lighting apparatus such as a channel illumination device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). Channel illumination devices are frequently used for signage including borders and lettering. In these devices, a wall structure outlines a desired shape to be illuminated, with one or more channels defined between the walls. A light source is mounted within the channel and a planar translucent diffuser is usually arranged at the top edges of the walls so as to enclose the channel. In this manner, a desired shape can be illuminated in a desired color as defined by the color of the lens and/or the LEDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> With reference next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a channel illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is disclosed comprising a casing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> in the shape of a &ldquo;P.&rdquo; The casing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and a bottom <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, which together define at least one channel. The surfaces of the walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> are diffusely-reflective, preferably being coated with a flat white coating. The walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> are preferably formed of a durable sturdy metal having relatively high heat conductivity. In the illustrated embodiment, a plurality of LED lighting modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are mounted to the walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> in a spaced-apart manner. A translucent light-diffusing lens (not shown) is preferably disposed on a top edge <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> of the walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and encloses the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With next reference also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the LED module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is held securely onto the walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the channel apparatus by pop rivets <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, or any other fastening means. Preferably, the connection of the module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> facilitates heat transfer from the module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the wall <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The channel wall has a relatively large surface area, facilitating efficient heat transfer to the environment and enabling the channel wall <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to function as a heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the LED modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably electrically connected in parallel relative to other modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. A power supply cord <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> preferably enters through one of the walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> or the bottom surface <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and preferably comprises two 18 AWG main conductors <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Short wires <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> are attached to the first and last contacts <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of each module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and preferably connect with respective main conductors <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> using insulation displacement connectors (IDCs) <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Although the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are operated at electrical currents higher than typical pre-packaged LEDs, the power efficiency characteristic of LEDs is retained. For example, a channel illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> using a plurality of LED modules might be expected to use about 4.5 watts of power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> With reference still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the LED modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably positioned so that the LEDs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> face generally downwardly, directing light away from the diffuser. The light is preferably directed to the diffusely-reflective wall and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. By directing the light away from the diffuser, &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; that are associated with more direct forms of lighting, such as typical incandescent and gas-filled bulb arrangements, are avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The reflectors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the LED modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> aid in directing light rays emanating from the LEDs toward the diffusely-reflective surfaces. It is to be understood, however, that an LED module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> not employing reflectors, or employing only the first reflector <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, can also be appropriately used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The relatively low profile of each LED module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> facilitates the indirect method of lighting because substantially no shadow is created by the module when it is positioned on the wall <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. A higher-profile light module would cast a shadow on the lens, producing an undesirable, visibly darkened area. To minimize the potential of shadowing, it is desirable to space the modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and accompanying power wires <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> a distance of at least about &frac12; inch from the top edge <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. More preferably, the modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are spaced more than one inch from the top <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The small size and low profile of the LED modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> enables the modules to be mounted at various places along the channel wall <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. For instance, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 18</cross-reference>, light modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must sometimes be mounted to curving portions <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> of walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The illustrated modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are about 1 inch to 1&frac12; inch long, and thus can be acceptably mounted to a curving wall <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the casing walls <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> are about 3 to 4 inches deep and the width of the channel is about 3 to 4 inches between the walls. In an apparatus of this size, LED modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> positioned on one side of the channel can provide sufficient lighting. The modules are preferably spaced about 5-6 inches apart. As may be anticipated, larger channel apparatus will likely require somewhat different arrangements of LED modules, including employing more LED modules. For example, a channel illumination apparatus having a channel width of 1 to 2 feet may employ LED modules on both walls and may even use multiple rows of LED modules. Additionally, the orientation of each of the modules may be varied in such a large channel illumination apparatus. For instance, some of the LED modules may desirably be angled so as to direct light at various angles relative to the diffusely reflective surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid creating hot spots, a direct light path from the LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the diffuser preferably is avoided. However, it is to be understood that pre-packaged LED lamps having diffusely-reflective lenses may advantageously be directed toward the channel letter lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Individual LEDs emit generally monochromatic light. Thus, it is preferable that an LED type be chosen which corresponds to the desired illumination color of the lighting apparatus. Additionally, if a diffuser is used, the diffuser preferably is chosen to be substantially the same color as the LEDs. Such an arrangement facilitates desirable brightness and color results. It is also to be understood that the diffusely-reflective wall and bottom surfaces may be coated to match the desired illumination color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Using LED modules <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to illuminate a channel illumination apparatus <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> provides significant savings during manufacturing. For example, a number of LED modules, along with appropriate wiring and hardware, can be included in a kit which allows a technician to easily assemble a lighting apparatus by simply securing the modules in place along the wall of a casing and connecting the wiring appropriately using IDCs or the like. There is no need for custom shaping of the light source, as is required with gas-filled bulbs. Accordingly, manufacturing effort and costs are significantly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Of course, it is to be understood that LED modules having aspects of any of the embodiments of LED modules described above or below can be used in such a channel illumination apparatus, or similar devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> With reference next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference>, the power traces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> discussed above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are configured so that a plurality of modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can easily be connected to one another by simply running a pair of relatively short wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> between the power traces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of each module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and soldering the wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in place on the power trace connecting portions <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. As such, a plurality of LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are wired together so that their corresponding LED series arrays are in an electrically parallel configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> With continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> preferably have the same length. As such, a plurality of modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be wired together to form a series or chain of such modules. Since the wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are the same length, the elongate series of modules is easy to mass produce with consistency. Preferably, the wires connect to the modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at the connecting portions <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> which are on generally opposing sides of the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is substantially longitudinally aligned with the associated flexible wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. This arrangement provides a secure connection of the wires to the circuit board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> With next reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a plurality of modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which have been wired together as shown in the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference>, can be provided within a dispenser <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to allow extremely easy and quick installation of the modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> into a light fixture such as a channel letter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> With reference specifically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>, a dispensing roll <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> can be provided having a multitude of such pre-wired LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> wound upon a roller <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. In order to install LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> within a channel letter <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or other fixture, a worker will simply arrange the channel letter adjacent the roll <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of LED modules, pull on the first available LED module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and secure the module, via its adhesive backing, in place on the wall <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the channel letter. As the module is pulled from the dispenser, adjacent connected modules are also drawn from the dispenser. Thus, once a module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is installed, another module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is pre-wired together with the first module, is ready and waiting to be installed on the channel letter wall, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The worker thus progressively installs the pre-wired LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the dispensing roll <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> dispenses modules as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When the appropriate amount of LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are installed, the worker simply snips the wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, disconnecting the installed LED modules from the LED modules that are still on the dispensing roll <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the installed modules are then connected to a power source <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. This method of installation is extremely fast. There is no need for the worker to perform soldering and there is very little wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows another method and apparatus for dispensing a plurality of LED modules. In this embodiment, a box <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> or other type of dispenser is supplied in which a plurality of wired-together LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are placed in an overlapping zigzag pattern. LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are drawn from the dispenser as needed and unwind within the box dispenser <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> as they are drawn therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that, for both of the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 23</cross-reference>, a dispenser <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can be provided that is sized to hold enough LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to provide and satisfy the lighting needs of many channel letters <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or other types of illumination devices so as to make manufacture of such devices efficient and easy. Such a dispenser could hold any desired number of modules. For example, a roller could be sized to hold 50, 100, 1000 or more modules in such a manner so that the interconnected modules do not become entangled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Although the dispenser <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a roller <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> or box <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, it is to be understood that any shape or form of dispenser can be used. In still another embodiment, the chain of wired-together modules can be coiled about itself rather than being wound about a roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> While the preferred module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> utilizes tape for securing the module to the surface, it will be understood that the above described dispensing arrangements may be used for modules that are not secured by tape, but by other means such as rivets, screws, glue, epoxy, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the electrical supply wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are soldered directly onto the power trace connecting portions <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood that, in other embodiments, connectors can be provided on the traces, and the wires themselves may have connecting members to mate with the connectors that are provided on the LED module. For instance, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows an LED module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having modular connectors <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> placed thereon. Leads <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> of the connectors <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are connected to the first and second power traces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> using solder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. the connectors <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are thus electrically connected to the contacts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Mounting portions <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> of the connectors <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> engage and are soldered to the contact connecting portions <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the secondary connecting portions <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in order to more securely hold the connector <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> onto the LED modules <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The modular connectors <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> are adapted to engage mating wire connectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. The wire connectors <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> are attached to the electrical supply wires <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the connectors <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> are engaged, the desired electrically parallel arrangement is maintained. In embodiments employing connectors, a channel letter or other illumination apparatus can be assembled by assembling modules and wire components as needed, and simply connecting these components via the connectors. </paragraph>
