<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to the use of acid catalyst diffusion to achieve narrower patterns in photoresist material without altering the resolution of an exposure tool. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">ART BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Microelectronic device fabrication typically entails the use of photolithographic processes to create tiny patterns of interconnected regions of material as part of the process of forming components within a microelectronic device. These photolithographic processes entail the use of an exposure tool with a mask to project some form of radiation (e.g., ultraviolet light, electrons or x-rays) onto photoresist material. The mask (or alternatively, a reticle, where a step-and-repeat system is used) restricts projection of the radiation such that only desired regions of the photoresist material are irradiated in order to create a pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The photoresist may be either a &ldquo;positive resist&rdquo; material in that the irradiated regions become soluble, allowing those regions to be subsequently removed, or a &ldquo;negative resist&rdquo; material in that the non-irradiated regions are subsequently removed. Typically, the pattern created by the removal of some regions of the photoresist material transfers a pattern to the underlying layer of material beneath the photoresist material by preventing those regions of the underlying material from being exposed, and thereby removed, in a subsequent processing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the density of the circuitry of microelectronic devices has continued to increase, the lines and other shapes making up the components of that circuitry within a microelectronic device have needed to become smaller. Typically, this reduction in size is achieved by using exposure tools and/or masks (or reticles) capable of achieving ever finer resolution, or by making modifications to existing exposure tools and/or masks. However, this repeated improving or replacement of exposure tools and/or masks is quite expensive. A need exists to create smaller patterns without having to make such expensive equipment replacements or modifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another prior art approach to achieving this reduction in size is to partially erode the photoresist material by exposing it to an oxygen plasma, a process commonly referred to as &ldquo;ashing.&rdquo; The eroding that occurs in ashing reduces the width of portions of photoresist material that remain after a pattern has been created, thereby providing a way to make thinner pattern lines or other smaller pattern features. However, the degree to which a pattern feature formed in photoresist material at a given location is eroded is hard to control with satisfactory precision since the degree of erosion at a given location is all too easily influenced environmental conditions at that location, including the proximity of other nearby pattern features. Also, the process of eroding that occurs also reduces the thickness of the layer of photoresist material, and this reduction of thickness is also affected by the environmental conditions at each given location such that the degree of reduction of thickness is not consistent. This reduction in thickness invites a risk of compromising the effectiveness of the photoresist material in preventing regions of material underlying the photoresist material from being exposed in a subsequent process step, which in turn, jeopardizes the ability of the photoresist to transfer a pattern to the underlying material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns improving the ability to create patterns with finer lines and/or smaller shapes in photoresist material. Specifically, the present invention concerns using temperature and/or additional time to allow additional chemical diffusion to occur within photoresist material, allowing more of it to become soluble so that more of the photoresist material can be removed in a subsequent processing step in order to create regions of photoresist material with thinner lines and/or smaller shapes. This resulting pattern of thinner lines or smaller shapes can be used to either transfer and thereby create such a pattern out of the material underlying the photoresist, or to create a pattern out of material to deposited amidst the photoresist within the voids created between the thinner lines and/or shapes of the photoresist pattern. Although the creation of such patterns is discussed as being part of a process of creating microelectronic circuitry, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention is also applicable to the processes in which photolithographic techniques are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>depict one embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a portion of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is irradiated (also commonly referred to as being &ldquo;exposed&rdquo;) by light <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> directed at photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through mask <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Mask <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> restricts the irradiation of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a specific portion of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, resulting in a pattern of differing intensity of irradiation (or &ldquo;exposure&rdquo;) of the kind depicted by aerial image <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Within photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a photoactive compound (or &ldquo;PAC&rdquo;) which responds chemically to light <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in those portions of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that mask <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> permits to be irradiated by light <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In differing embodiments, light <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> maybe visible light, infrared light, ultraviolet light, x-rays, microwaves or other forms of radiant energy, whether visible to the human eye or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> chemically reacts to being irradiated by light <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, resulting in portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> becoming chemically different from the rest of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a positive resist and the chemical reaction that takes place as a result of being irradiated is the creation of an amount of an acid or acid catalyst. In this embodiment, this creation of acid or acid catalyst within portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> makes portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> more soluble, and therefore more susceptible to being removed by a solvent in a subsequent process step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> encompasses more of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as one or more chemical compounds created as a result of portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> being irradiated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>diffuse into adjacent portions of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the passage of a length of time calculated to allow this diffusion to progress to a predetermined extent before a subsequent process step is used to either chemically remove the expanded portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>or to halt further diffusion while leaving the expanded portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in place. In another embodiment, exposing photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a higher temperature calculated to allow this diffusion to progress to a predetermined extent before a subsequent process step is used. In still another embodiment, a combination of the passage of a length of time and exposure to a higher temperature is used to control the extent of this diffusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>depicts the result of the removal of the expanded portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in a subsequent process step, leaving behind portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, this diffusion and subsequent removal of expanded portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is used to achieve finer dimensions for the portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that are not removed in subsequent process steps. In another embodiment, this diffusion and subsequent removal of expanded portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is used to reduce the amount of time an exposure tool must be used to create a given pattern within photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In this other embodiment, an exposure tool is used to begin the process of making a portion of photoresist <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> susceptible to removal in a subsequent process step, and diffusion is used to carry the process further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>depicts the results of a post-exposure bake step that follows the exposure step depicted by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and that precedes a developing step, the results of which is depicted by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>In common practice, the time between the completion of an exposure step and a developing step (which includes time for a post-exposure bake) is kept as short as possible to minimize opportunities for either the photoresist material <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and/or the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>during exposure to react with gases in the surrounding environment. Indeed, for this reason, it is also common practice is to limit the time during which the post-exposure bake occurs to just the amount of time required to allow the chemical compound or compounds created during exposure to react with one or more materials comprising the portion of the photoresist that was irradiated (i.e., portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with boundaries as defined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and not the expanded portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). However, in one variation of this embodiment, the post-exposure bake time is extended to allow the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>during exposure to diffuse into adjacent portions of photoresist material <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, resulting in the expanded portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Furthermore, in this variation of this embodiment, the post-exposure bake may occur within an environment comprised of an inert gas that serves to reduce opportunities for either photoresist material <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and/or the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> during exposure to react with gases in the surrounding environment during the extended post-exposure bake time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>depict another embodiment of the present invention as applied to the making of a pattern in a layer of material. Many of the numbered items in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>are meant to generally correspond to numbered items in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>in a manner corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a portion of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is irradiated by light <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> directed at photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through mask <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Mask <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> restricts the irradiation of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to a specific portion of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, resulting in a pattern of differing intensity of irradiation of the kind depicted by aerial image <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. Within photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a photoactive compound which responds chemically to light <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in those portions of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that mask <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> permits to be irradiated by light <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. However, unlike <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is depicted as overlying two layers of material, layers <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the present invention is being used to create a microelectronic device and layer <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is a film deposited atop a substrate in the form of layer <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>in a manner corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> chemically reacts to being irradiated by light <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, resulting in portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> becoming chemically different from the rest of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as an amount of one or more chemicals are created within portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the chemical reaction that ensues causes portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to become more susceptible to being removed by a solvent in a subsequent process step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>in a manner that corresponds to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> extends further into the rest of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as one or more of the chemicals created in the chemical reaction caused by the irradiation diffuse into adjacent portions of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the extent to which the diffusion takes place, and therefore the extent to which portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> expands, is controlled by allowing a predetermined amount of time to pass before performing a subsequent step that stops the diffusion. In an alternate embodiment, the application of heat of a predetermined amount is used to either induce or increase the rate of diffusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment where the extent to which diffusion takes place, and therefore the extent to portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> expands, is controlled by allowing a predetermined amount of time to pass, the predetermined amount of time is increased to accommodate increasing the post-exposure bake time to an amount deliberately in excess of the amount of time required to simply allow the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to engage in a reaction that causes portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to become more susceptible to removal in a subsequent process step. In prior art practice, the post-exposure bake time, as well as the entire time between irradiation and the subsequent process step is often minimized as much as possible to avoid unnecessarily increasing the risk of contamination of photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or other the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, as well as to avoid unnecessarily slowing down an entire production line where post-exposure baking is carried out. The risk of contamination by reaction with one or more chemicals in the atmosphere is increased during post-exposure bake due to the addition of heat energy making photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> more reactive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, in one variation of this embodiment of the present invention, a longer post-exposure bake time is chosen to induce or allow diffusion to take place, with the length of the post-exposure bake time being chosen based on such factors as the characteristics of photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the thickness of the layer of photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the desired increase in the width of portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the post-exposure bake temperature, the consistency of the thickness of the layer of photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the intensity and time of the irradiation of photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the depth and consistency of focus for light <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> during irradiation, steps taken to counteract inaccuracies in depth of focus for light <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the time and temperature at which a soft bake step prior to exposure was carried out, and/or the uniformity of the temperature of the post-exposure bake throughout photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In this variation of this embodiment, the post-exposure bake temperature may also be controlled (in addition to the post-exposure bake time being controlled) to ensure that the width of features created in a desired pattern remain uniform despite inherent inaccuracies or variations in other factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another variation of this embodiment, a commonly available photoresist material is used, and the limits specified by the manufacturer regarding post-exposure bake temperatures are adhered to. The initial recommendation for post-exposure bake time from the manufacturer (which is in the range of 60 to 90 seconds for some commonly available photoresist materials) is first tried, and then reductions and increases in that time by 5% or 10% are tried to determine the degree to which portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> would expand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In still another variation of this embodiment, recommendations are made to a manufacturer of photoresist materials to either alter the chemical makeup of a commonly available photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> or to create a new photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that will have characteristics that better optimize photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for controlling the degree of diffusion through control of the post-exposure bake time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In yet another variation of this embodiment, photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is dosed with an additional chemical compound to a degree that is controlled (in addition to the post-exposure bake time being controlled) to ensure that the width of features created in a desired pattern remain uniform despite inherent inaccuracies or variations in other factors, including uniformity of temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one specific variation of this embodiment, TDUR 501, a product of Japan-based Tokyo Ohka Kogyo, is used as photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In this variation of this embodiment, the post-exposure bake time is increased to <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> seconds to cause the width of portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to expand by at least 10 nm. Alternatively, the post-exposure bake time is increased to 150 seconds to cause the width of portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to expand by at least 25 nm. In still another alternative, the post-exposure bake time is increased to beyond 150 seconds, achieving still greater expansions of portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In another specific variation of this embodiment, TDUR 534, another product of Japan-based Tokyo Ohka Kogyo, is used as photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In this variation of this embodiment, the post-exposure bake time is increased to 180 seconds to cause the width of portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to expand by at least 15 nm. Alternatively, the post-exposure bake time is increased to 270 seconds to cause the width of portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to expand by at least 25 nm. In still another alternative, the post-exposure bake time is increased to beyond 270 seconds, achieving still greater expansions of portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment where the extent to which diffusion takes place, and therefore the extent to portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> expands, is controlled by the application of heat, the post-exposure bake temperature is raised to an amount deliberately in excess of the temperature required to simply allow the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to engage in a reaction that causes portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to become more susceptible to removal in a subsequent process step. In prior art practice, the post-exposure bake temperature is often minimized as much as possible to avoid unnecessarily increasing the risk of inducing unwanted chemical reactions in photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or other the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, as well as to avoid unnecessarily slowing down an entire production line where post-exposure baking is carried out. As discussed earlier, the risk of a chemical reaction with one or more chemicals in the atmosphere is increased during post-exposure bake due to the addition of heat energy making photoresist <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and/or the chemical compound or compounds created in portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> more reactive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> However, in one variation of this embodiment of the present invention, a higher post-exposure bake temperature is chosen to induce or allow diffusion to take place, with the choice of temperature being based on such factors as the characteristics of photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the thickness of the layer of photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the desired increase in the width of portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the post-exposure bake time, the consistency of the thickness of the layer of photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the intensity and time of the irradiation of photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the depth and consistency of focus for light <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> during irradiation, steps taken to counteract inaccuracies in depth of focus for light <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the time and temperature at which a soft bake step prior to exposure was carried out, and/or the uniformity of the temperature of the post-exposure bake throughout photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In this variation of this embodiment, the post-exposure bake temperature may also be controlled to ensure that the width of features created in a desired pattern remain uniform despite inherent inaccuracies or variations in other factors. Furthermore, in this variation of this embodiment, the temperature at which photoresist material <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> would be expected to liquefy may also be taken into account. </paragraph>

Mask <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> restricts the irradiation of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to a specific portion of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, resulting in a pattern of differing intensity of irradiation of the kind depicted by aerial image <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>a manner that is somewhat analogous to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> chemically reacts to being irradiated by light <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, resulting in portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> becoming chemically different from the rest of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as an amount of one or more chemicals are created within portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. However, unlike portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight>the chemical reaction occurring within portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> results in portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> becoming less susceptible, rather than more susceptible, to being removed in a subsequent process step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> extends further into the rest of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> as one or more of the chemicals created in the chemical reaction caused by the irradiation diffuse into adjacent portions of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the extent to which the diffusion takes place, and therefore the extent to which portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> extends further into adjacent portions of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, is controlled by allowing a predetermined amount of time to pass before performing a subsequent step that stops the diffusion. In an alternate embodiment, the application of heat of a predetermined amount is used to either induce or increase the rate of diffusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, one of the chemicals created in the chemical reaction resulting from portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> being exposed to light <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is an acid or acid catalyst. In this embodiment, it is this acid or acid catalyst that diffuses into the portions of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that are adjacent to portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, thereby extending portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. In a subsequent step in this embodiment, photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is exposed to a vapor containing a chemical compound that diffuses into photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, including portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and reacts with the acid or acid catalyst with the result that portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> becomes less susceptible to being removed in a subsequent process step than adjacent portions of photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In an alternate embodiment, photoresist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is doped with a material that allows the acid or acid catalyst to be later altered to again make portion <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> less susceptible to being removed in a subsequent process step. </paragraph>

At <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, a portion of a layer photoresist material is irradiated, causing chemical reaction to occur within that portion, resulting in the formation of a chemical compound within that portion. In one variation of this embodiment, there would be multiple portions of a layer of photoresist material that would be irradiated, and other multiple portions that would not be, forming a pattern.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If at <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, the effect of the chemical compound on a portion of photoresist material is to make that portion more susceptible to being removed in a subsequent process step, then at <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a portion of the photoresist material in which the chemical compound exists is removed in a subsequent process step.
