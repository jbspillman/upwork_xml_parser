<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a speaker enclosure for housing mid-range and high frequency transducers configured to minimize the diffraction that could interfere with wave fronts from its transducers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are many types of speaker enclosures and each type can affect how sound is produced. Within a speaker enclosure is at least one driver (or transducer) that has a vibrating diaphragm for emitting sound waves in front of the cone. A baffle forms the front side of the speaker enclosure and has a wave guide that forms a smooth transition between the cone of the driver and the front side of the speaker enclosure. Moreover, a speaker enclosure may house a combination of drivers, such as mid-range and high frequency drivers, in one unit to keep the combination of drivers in a correct position so that they can work together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One of the problems associated with a speaker enclosure is a phenomenon known as diffraction. Diffraction interferes with the quality of sound produced by the drivers. For example, a typical baffle may be substantially flat so that the speaker enclosure has a flat face. As the wave front propagates from the driver, it starts from the diaphragm and propagates along the wave guide and then along the outer edge of the speaker enclosure. Beyond the outer edge of the speaker enclosure, the wave front does not have a baffle to sustain the wave front and so it goes into free air. As the wave front transitions from the outer edge of the baffle to free air, there is an abrupt discontinuity to sustain the wave front. Such abrupt discontinuity, however, can cause eddy currents to occur in the wave front. Eddy currents may be generally described as whirl or circular currents of air running contrary to the steady flow of fluid causing a vortex. Eddy currents occur when there is a boundary layer separation between the wave front and the surface that is supporting the wave front. Eddy currents destructively add to the wave front such that the quality of sound is diminished. This phenomenon may be generally described as a diffraction. In particular, diffraction occurs from wave fronts that propagate from high frequency drivers because the velocity of wave fronts are higher, which further induces boundary layer separation to occur. As the velocity of the wave front increases, the momentum of the wave front may overcome the pressure forces holding the wave front to the support surface to cause boundary layer separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another common shortfall of the speaker enclosure is the control of sound waves, both in horizontal and vertical axis. In the horizontal axis, a wide sound disbursement is preferred so that a listener can move from the center position without losing stereo image. In the vertical axis, however, the sound disbursement should be more controlled because listeners are typically limited in their vertical movements. In other words, a listener&apos;s movements are much more limited in the vertical axis than in the horizontal axis. Despite this distinction, speaker enclosures do not control or stabilize the sound waves in the vertical axis in order to improve the quality of sound. Therefore, there is still a need for a speaker enclosure that minimizes diffractions from occurring and provides a more stable or controlled sound disbursement in the vertical axis. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a speaker enclosure that is configured to minimize diffractions from occurring. To accomplish this, a portion of the baffle that is adjacent to a high frequency driver may be tapered inward to provide a smooth transition for the wave fronts to propagate from the outer edge of the speaker housing to free air. Providing a smooth transition for the wave fronts minimizes the occurrence of eddy currents so that diffractions do not interfere with the quality of sound from the driver. Moreover, the portion of the baffle that is adjacent to the high frequency driver may be curved and smooth to the outer edge of the baffle to further minimize diffractions from occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To stabilize or control the wave fronts in the vertical axis, the baffle may be elongated in the vertical axis to sustain the wave front in that axis. That is, the elongated baffle in the vertical axis forms a surface that behaves as a wave guide to control and sustain the wave front in the vertical axis to enhance the quality of sound. However, in the horizontal axis, the baffle may be narrower than in the vertical axis so that the wave fronts may disperse more widely in the horizontal axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the invention will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> forming the front face of the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a mid-frequency wave guide <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a high frequency (HF) wave guide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> adapted to mate with a mid-range frequency driver and a high frequency driver, respectively. The mid-frequency driver may operate between about 100 Hz and about 2.5 KHz, and the high frequency driver may operate between about 2.5 KHz and 20.0 KHz. The baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be elongated in the longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (or vertical axis) as compared to the horizontal axis <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the bottom portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that is adjacent the high frequency range port <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be elongated to further sustain the wave fronts in the vertical axis to control the propagation of the sound wave in the longitudinal axis. In contrast, the baffle in the horizontal axis may be narrower than in the vertical axis to provide wider disbursements of the wave fronts in the horizontal axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also shows the bottom edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> adjacent to the high frequency wave guide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the longitudinal axis generally forming a curve such as a shape of a parabola. Forming a smooth surface along the bottom edge <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> removes any abrupt discontinuity which could cause eddy current from occurring. Therefore, the bottom edge has been curved to provide a smooth transition between the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the atmosphere for the wave fronts to minimize diffraction from occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> along the vertical axis. And <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> along the horizontal axis. From both views, the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> provides a transition surface from the wave guide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the edge <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the speaker housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In particular, the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> tapers inward smoothly from the wave guide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the edge <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the speaker housing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> both in the vertical axis and the horizontal axis. This is done to minimize eddy currents from occurring along the edge of the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as the wave fronts transition from the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the atmosphere. Moreover, the wave fronts from the HF driver may have a greater chance of inducing eddy current than the wave fronts from the midrange driver because the wave fronts from the HF driver propagate at higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths than the wave fronts of the mid-range driver. Besides frequency, the surface of the baffle can also influence this phenomena. To account for this, the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may have more transition surface area around the HF wave guide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> than around the mid-range wave guide <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to minimize eddy currents from occurring around the HF wave guide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, with the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> tapering smoothly inward from the wave guides to the edge <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, occurrence of diffraction which interferes with the quality of sound may be substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition to minimizing the occurrence of diffraction, the bottom portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> also sustains the wave front along the vertical axis <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to control and stabilize the sound disbursement in the vertical axis. For example, the distance &ldquo;Y&rdquo; between the center of the wave guide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the lowermost edge <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be about 3.5 inches. This means that wave lengths which are less than 3.5 inches may be affected by the bottom portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. For instance, since the HF driver operates above about 2.5 KHz, the longest wave length occurs at 2.5 KHz, which is about 1.3 cm (3.5 inches). Accordingly, the bottom portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may act like an extension of the wave guide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to direct and stabilize the wave fronts propagating from the HF driver in the vertical axis. Since listeners are limited in their vertical movement generally between the sitting and standing positions, the sound disbursement may be stabilized and controlled between the two positions to improve the quality of sound in that listening zone. Accordingly, the bottom portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> minimizes the occurrence of diffraction and controls the disbursement of sound waves in the vertical axis to improve the quality of sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the horizontal axis, the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> adjacent to the mid-range frequency driver may be narrow to provide wider disbursement of the sound waves in the horizontal axis. For instance, a mid-range driver may operate between about 100 HZ and 2.5 KHz. Accordingly, the shortest wave length from the mid-range frequency driver may be about 1.3 cm (3.5 inches), at 2.5 KHz. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, along the horizontal axis <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the distance between the mid-range wave guide <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the outer edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is substantially less than 3.5 inches. This means that the baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> does not interfere with the wave fronts along the horizontal axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> forms a smooth transition from the wave guide <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the outer edge of the baffle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to minimize eddy currents from occurring. With the baffle forming a smooth transition from the wave guide <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the outer edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and not interfering with wave fronts from the mid-range driver, the mid-range driver may substantially perform as a point source driver without the interference from diffraction. This way, the mid-range driver in the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides a wide horizontal stereo coverage so that a listener may move in a horizontal axis and hear a high quality stereo image. Additionally the speaker enclosure houses the mid-range and HF drivers to optimize the performance of the two drivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> illustrate a back housing <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> enclosing mid and high frequency drivers. And the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be manufactured as the following. The back housing <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be molded using plastic material to enclose the mid and high frequency drivers. The back housing <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be configured so that the back side <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has a smaller surface area than the front baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As such, the side walls <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, the top side <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, and the bottom side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> all taper inward towards the back side <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. This allows the wave front from the drivers to wrap around the outer surfaces of the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with minimal diffraction, if at all. The front baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be molded with a plastic material as well. The front baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be configured to mate with the opening of the back housing <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> so that the two combination substantially seal the two drivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The front baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be molded to forms a convex surface and may be the largest surface of the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In other words, the front baffle may be configured to gradually curves to the edge of the speaker enclosure to provide a smooth transition for the wave fronts from the surface of the baffle to the edge of the speaker enclosure. The edge of the front baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be rounded forming a smooth curve like a parabola and half circle. The bottom portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the front baffle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be elongated along the longitudinal axis to act as an extension of the high frequency wave guide. In particular, the wave front <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be molded so that the bottom portion <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is at least as long as the longest wavelength from the high frequency driver to direct and stabilize the wave front in the vertical axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates performance curves for a rectangular speaker enclosure housing the same mid-range and HF drivers arranged substantially similarly as in the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The rectangular speaker enclosure tested had the following dimensions: height of about 7.7 inches, width of about 5.5 inches, and depth of about 4.5 inches. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates performance curves for the same test conducted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, except that the mid-range and HF drivers are housed in the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows three curves, in particular: a curve <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, which is an average of all the measurements taken around the rectangular enclosure in a 360&deg; sphere in the horizontal axis; a curve <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, which is an average measurement taken around the rectangular enclosure in a 360&deg; sphere in the vertical axis; and a curve <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, referred to as a power curve, is an average of the two horizontal and vertical average curves <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. For the rectangular enclosure, there is about 5 dB difference (80.0 dB-75.0 dB) between the two curves <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in the frequency range from about 1.0 KHz to about 4 KHz. In other words, there is a large swing between the horizontal and the vertical dispersions between the frequency range of 1.0 KHz and 4 KHz, which can cause a shift in the sound quality as a listener moves in the vertical direction by sitting down, for example. Such a shift can cause the sound quality and sound stage to collapse which is noticeable to a listener. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows three curves for the test conducted on a speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>: a curve <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, which is an average of measurements taken around the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a 360&deg; sphere in the horizontal axis; a curve <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, which is an average measurement taken around the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a 360&deg; sphere in the vertical axis; and a power curve <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, which is an average of the two horizontal and vertical average curves <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Here, there is about 3.5 dB difference (79.5 dB-76 dB) between the two curves <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, so that the shift in the vertical dispersion is not as noticeable as the rectangular enclosure. In the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the shift may occur in a much narrower frequency range than with the rectangular enclosure. For instance, with the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the shift may occur between about 2.5 KHz and about 3.5 KHz. However, with the rectangular enclosure, the shift may occur in the much wider range of 1.0 KHz to 4.0 KHz. Since a listener&apos;s ears are more sensitive to a shift in a wider frequency range, the shift for the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be less noticeable than with the rectangular enclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Another noticeable performance characteristic between the rectangular enclosure and the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the sound power curves <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the power curve <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> has a dip at about 2.0 KHz and a peak at about 3.5 KHz. The dip at 2.0 KHz generally signifies a crossover from the mid-frequency driver to the HF driver, which is noticeable with the rectangular enclosure. In contrast, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the power curve <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> shows a gradual transition without the dips and peaks, which means that there is little evidence of crossover with the speaker enclosure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This means that when designing a crossover network to filter the mid-frequency from the high frequency, less electronic components are needed to deal with the crossover effect. Using less components of course means less cost to produce the speaker system coupled with an improvement in the sound quality. </paragraph>
