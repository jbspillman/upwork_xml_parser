<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND IF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a rolling bearing provided with a sealing member for preventing the leakage of enclosed grease as well as the entrance of dust, water, muddy water, etc. into the interior of the bearing as in wheel rolling bearing for bearing the wheel of automobile or railway vehicle or rolling bearing for steel rolling device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For example, a wheel rolling bearing for bearing the wheel of automobile is occasionally forced to be not only exposed to much dust but also operated while the wheel being dipped in muddy water. The rolling bearing is also exposed to wash water when the automobile is washed. Due to outdoor use, a rolling bearing for bearing the wheel of railway vehicle is also exposed to dust and weather in operation and to wash water when the vehicle is washed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> When the rolling bearing is used under such severe conditions, the sealing member of the rolling bearing is subject to removal of lubricant such as grease which has been previously applied to a lip portion of the sealing member. Thus, an elastic member constituting the lip portion undergoes abnormal abrasion that deteriorates the sealing properties of the sealing member, thereby making it more likely that water, dust, etc. can enter into the interior of the rolling bearing. As a result, the rolling bearing can difficultly maintain its desired properties over an extended period of time. In the worst case, the rolling bearing can break in an early stage. Even if the rolling bearing can maintain its desired sealing properties, the heat generated by sliding of the lip portion with respect to the bearing member causes the deterioration of lubricant such as enclosed grease because the lip portion possibly has no sufficient lubricant present thereon. In this case, it is difficult to maintain desired properties over an extended period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, the rolling bearing for steel rolling device is much exposed to dust such as iron ore dust and coke dust and also is used while being sprayed with cooling water for cooling the bearing itself. Accordingly, the rolling bearing for steel rolling device is difficult to maintain its desired properties over an extended period of time similarly to the rolling bearing for vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, the sealing member of the foregoing wheel rolling bearing has comprised an elastic member formed by a rubber material composition having proper additives incorporated in an ordinary nitrile rubber. As well known, a rolling bearing for automobile wheel is used outdoor and thus can be exposed to much dust. The rolling bearing is also used under conditions such that it is exposed to rain water or wash water or, in the worst case, dipped in muddy water. A sealing member comprising an elastic member formed by an ordinary nitrile rubber material composition exhibits sufficient sealing properties even while being lubricated under so-called clean conditions such that it is relatively little subject to exposure to water and dust. However, under recent requirements that the life of wheel bearing be prolonged or the torque of the wheel bearing be lowered to enhance the fuel economy of automobile, the grease applied to the lip portion can undergo softening or emulsification in an extreme case under the foregoing severe conditions. When the grease runs out, it is impossible to maintain desired lubricity sufficiently. Further, the lip can undergo abnormal abrasion that deteriorates the sealing properties of the sealing member, so that it is more likely occurred that dust or water can enter into the interior of the bearing and hence making it impossible to maintain desired bearing properties over an extended period of time. In order to improve the sealing properties of the sealing member, the increase of the fastening margin can be proposed. However, this approach causes the rise of torque, so that the lip likely undergo abrasion that deteriorates the sealing properties of the sealing member. Further, the resulting abrasion heat causes the deterioration of grease so that the life of the bearing is likely reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In an attempt to eliminate these defectives, it has been practiced to incorporate a solid lubricant such as fluororesin and molybdenum disulfide and a wax such as paraffin wax and aliphatic acid amide in the rubber composition constituting the elastic member so that the abrasion of the lip portion can be inhibited and the generation of heat due to sliding and the rotary torque can be lowered even when the grease runs out, making it impossible to keep the bearing lubricated sufficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Further, the wheel rolling bearing provided with a sealing member comprising an elastic member formed by the conventional nitrile rubber composition cannot operate for a sufficiently prolonged life under the foregoing severe working conditions . </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a rolling bearing having a prolonged life suitable for wheel, railway vehicle and steel rolling mill comprising a sealing member which exhibits fair sealing properties even under such severe conditions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The rubber composition constituting the elastic members <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, dust lip <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and main lip <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>to be used in the various sealing members will be further described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the rolling bearing of the invention, the elastic member constituting the sealing member is formed by a vulcanizable rubber composition obtained by blending a carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber with at least carbon black as a reinforcing filler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has a carboxyl group incorporated in its molecule. Thus, crosslinking reaction proceeds also at the carboxyl group moiety in the presence of a metal oxide such as zinc oxide as a vulcanization accelerator added at the same time to give a higher tensile strength than ordinary nitrile rubber. Accordingly, the use of a rubber composition comprising as a raw rubber such a carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber makes it possible to obtain a sealing member excellent in abrasion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber is synthesized by adding an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, which is a carboxylic group-containing monomer, or anhydride thereof in addition to acrylonitrile and butadiene, which are ordinary monomers to be used in the polymerization of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, during preparation such as emulsion polymerization. Alternatively, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber and an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid such as maleic anhydride or anhydride thereof may be kneaded in a batchwise heat sealed kneader such as pressure kneader, Banbury mixer and Brabender to produce the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The actual amount of carboxyl group in the obtained polymer is, in terms of an acid-equivalent weight, preferably 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>ephr or more, and more preferably 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>ephr. If the acid-equivalent weight is less than 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>ephr, the cross linking density is almost the same in comparison with acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (not yet carboxylated), and accordingly the tensile strength and the abrasion resistance of rubber material composition are scarcely improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For the determination of acid equivalent, the rubber is dissolved in acetone. The rubber is then reprecipitated and purified with n-hexane. The rubber thus reprecipitated and purified is redissolved in pyridine. The rubber solution is then titrated with a 0.02 N ethanol solution of potassium hydroxide with thymolphthalein as an indicator. Thus, the acid equivalent is then determined relative to 100 g of rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has several kinds as the ordinary acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, and according to the containing amounts of acrylonitrile, there are in order the lower amounts, a low nitrile, a middle nitrile, a middle-high nitrile, a high nitrile, and an ultra high nitrile, and taking a heat resistance and an oil resistance into consideration, the middle nitrile, middle-high nitrile, high nitrile are desirable, and preferably 20 to 40% in terms of the amount of containing acrylonitrile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The foregoing carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber having a desired acid equivalent or acrylonitrile content is available also commercially. Nipol DN631 (AN: 33.5) and Nipol 1072 (AN: 27) produced by Nippon Zeon Co., Ltd. may be used by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The foregoing carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has carbon black incorporated therein as a reinforcing filler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Specifically, there maybe enumerated SAF (Super Abrasion Furnace black), ISAF (Intermediate Super Abrasion Furnace black), MAF (Medium Abrasion Furnace black), SRF (Semi-Reinforcing Furnace black), GPF (General Purpose Furnace black), FT (Fine Thermal Furnace black), MT (Medium Thermal Furnace black), HAF (High Abrasion Furnace black), and FEF (Fast Extruding Furnace black). For heightening the abrasion resistance, HAF, FEF, GPF and SRF having excellent reinforcing property and form-workability are desirable, and two kinds or more may be combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As the white filler, practically, taken up are hydrated silica, clay, talc, calcium carbonate, diatomaceous earth, wollastonite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, carbon black and white filler may be mixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The incorporation of carbon black as a reinforcing filler in the rubber composition makes it possible to enhance the abrasion resistance of the lip of the sealing member, resulting in the improvement of sealing properties. The amount of carbon black to be incorporated in the rubber composition is not specifically limited but is preferably from 15 to 80 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. When the amount of carbon black to be incorporated in the rubber composition falls below 15 parts by weight, sufficient reinforcing effect cannot be exerted, providing no satisfactory results. On the contrary, when the amount of carbon black to be incorporated in the rubber composition exceeds 80 parts by weight, no further improvement of reinforcement and abrasion resistance can be recognized. Further, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits an extremely deteriorated moldability and thus can difficultly be formed into desired component. Moreover, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits too high a hardness and a low elongation and thus loses its inherent rubber elasticity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the case where the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has carbon black and a white filler incorporated therein in combination, the content of carbon black and white filler are preferably from 10 to 70 parts by weight and from 10 to 120 parts by weight, totaling from 20 to 200 parts by weight. When the total content of these additives falls below 20 parts by weight, sufficient reinforcement cannot be provided. On the contrary, when the total content of these additives exceeds 200 parts by weight, no further improvement of reinforcement and abrasion resistance cannot be recognized. Further, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits an extremely deteriorated moldability and thus can difficultly be formed into desired component. Moreover, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits too high a hardness and a low elongation and thus loses its inherent rubber elasticity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has a silicone oil incorporated therein as a lubricity providing agent. The kind of the silicone oil to be used herein is not specifically limited. In practice, however, a straight silicone oil, i.e., homopolymer of organic siloxane such as methylsiloxane, dimethylsiloxane, methylphenylsiloxane and trimethylfluoropropylsiloxane, copolymer of two or more of these organosiloxanes or modified silicone oil may be used. The modified silicone oil may contain a compound obtained by substituting some of methyl groups in a straight silicone oil by other lower alkyl, aralkyl or fluorinated alkyl groups or may be a compound modified by substituting by amino group, epoxy group, hydroxyl group, mercapto group, carboxylic acid alkyl group or group obtained by substituting such a hydrocarbon group by halogen. These functional groups react with or are adsorbed by the main chain of carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber to prevent the silicone oil from blooming to the surface of the rubber composition at once and gradually and permanently bloom to the surface of the rubber composition, inhibiting the occurrence of poor external appearance of molded product. These silicone oils may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The silicone oil to be used herein preferably exhibits a dynamic viscosity of from 20 to 100,000 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/S at 25&deg; C. When the dynamic viscosity of the silicone oil falls below 20 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/S, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits insufficient abrasion resistance and abrasion characteristics. on the contrary, when the dynamic viscosity of the silicone oil exceeds 100,000 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/S, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits deteriorated machinability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A silicone oil is in the form of liquid and thus can easily bloom to the surface of the rubber composition. Even when used in a small amount, the silicone oil exerts its effect. Accordingly, the amount of silicone oil to be incorporated in the rubber composition is preferably from not smaller than 0.2 parts by weight to less than 30 parts by weight, particularly from 1 to 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. When the amount of silicone oil to be incorporated in the rubber composition falls below 0.2 parts by weight, sufficient lubricity cannot be exhibited. On the contrary, when the amount of silicone oil to be incorporated in the rubber composition exceeds 30 parts by weight, maldispersion of additives can occur during machining. Further, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits an extremely deteriorated adhesivity to the core metal constituting the sealing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The rubber composition may comprise-known conventional additives such as vulcanizing agent, vulcanization accelerator, vulcanizing aid, age resistor, reinforcing agent, plasticizer, coupling agent, pigment, dye, release agent, machining aid and electrically conducting agent, abrasion improver and friction improver incorporated therein in a proper amount as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> For example, as the abrasion improver there may be used a polyolefin, spherically particulate carbon or the like. Examples of the polyolefin employable herein include polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene-1, and poly-4-methylpentene-1. Among these polyolefins, a high density polyethylene is desirable for the improvement of friction characteristics. In order to improve the adhesivity of high density polyethylene to carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber and the dispersibility of high density polyethylene in carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, the high density polyethylene may be modified with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or anhydride thereof. When modified with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or anhydride thereof, the polyethylene can be easily adsorbed by various rubbers or oxides due to the carboxyl group in the structure. Further, since the carboxyl group present in the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has the same effect, the resulting synergistic effect causes further improvement of mechanical properties such as tensile strength and abrasion resistance to advantage. Examples of the unsaturated carboxylic acid or anhydride thereof include unsaturated carboxylic acid such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and oleic acid, and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid such as maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride and citraconic anhydride. One or more of these unsaturated carboxylic acids may be used. In particular, maleic anhydride is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The amount of the polyolefin to be incorporated is preferably from 5 to 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber taking into account the abrasion resistance and other physical properties of the rubber material composition. When the amount of the polyolefin to be incorporated falls below 5 parts by weight, the resulting effect of improving abrasion resistance is not sufficient. On the contrary, when the amount of the polyolefin to be incorporated exceeds 60 parts by weight, no further improvement of reinforcement and abrasion resistance can be recognized. Further, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits an extremely deteriorated moldability and thus can difficultly be formed into desired component. Moreover, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits too high a hardness and a low elongation and thus loses its inherent rubber elasticity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Further, the globular carbon particle (vitrified carbon, globular graphite) is formed in that phenol formaldehyde resin is carbonized and baked in nitrogen at temperatures of 800 to 2000&deg; C., and the average grain size is around 2 to 40 &mgr;m. Practically, Bel-Pearl C (registered trade mark) of Kanebo Co., Ltd. is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> When such globular carbon particles exist on the surface of the rubber material composition, the globular carbon particles receive load, so that the abrasion resistance of the rubber material composition is largely improved. The mixing ratio of the globular carbon particles is not especially limited, but desirably 5 to 40 wt parts for 100 wt parts of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The lubricant for heightening lubrication will be explained. As the lubricant, a wax (oil and fatty of low melting point) of a melting point being 40 to 140&deg; C. is listed. Actually, falling into the above range of the melting point, there are paraffin wax, micro-crystal wax, polyethylene wax, montan wax, carnauba wax, ester based wax, stearoamide, oxystearo amide, erucylamide, laurylamide, palmitylamide, behenamide, methylolamide, ethylenebisoleylamide, stearyloleylamide. Among them, the polyethylene wax is most desirable. If these lubricants are added 3 to 30 wt parts for 100 wt parts of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, the lubrication of the rubber material composition goes up. Being less than 3 parts, the sufficient lubrication cannot be provided, and being more than 30 wt parts, not only the sufficient tensile strength and elongation cannot be obtained and the rubber elasticity goes down, but also the adherence between the core metal and the elastic member composing the sealing member is extremely decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As the friction improver there may be used also a liquid material (lubricant) such as mineral oil, ether-based oil, silicone-based oil, poly-a-olefin oil, fluorine oil and fluorine-based surface active agent. Preferred among these friction improvers is silicone-based oil. A silicone oil is a normally liquid material comprising a polydimethylsiloxane as a main component. The silicone oil is preferably of modified type having a polydimethylsiloxane substituted by amino group, alkyl group, epoxy group, polyether group, higher aliphatic acid ester or the like at some of methyl groups or at terminal thereof. The modification by such a functional group causes the functional group to react with or be adsorbed by the main chain in the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, making it possible to prevent the oil from blooming to the surface of the rubber composition at once and cause the oil to the surface of the rubber composition gradually and permanently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Since the lubricant oil is liquid and easy to bloom on the surface of the rubber material composition, the lubricating effect is displayed with an addition smaller than that of the lubricant. If such a lubricant oil is added 1 to 30 wt parts for 100 wt parts of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, the lubricity of the rubber material composition is improved. Being less than 1 wt part, the sufficient lubricity is not provided, while being more than 30 wt parts, a poor dispersion of the additive easily occurs during processing the rubber material composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The viscosity of the lubricant to be used herein is not specifically defined. Any of commercially available products may be used. In practice, however, a lubricant having a viscosity of from 2 to 10,000 mm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s at 25&deg; C. is preferred because it can be easily incorporated in the rubber composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When there is no mechanism for electrically conducting between the vehicle and the bearing for wheel, electrostatic charge-generated during the running of automobile is left in the vehicle, occasionally producing defectives causing radio noise when the vehicle starts to run. In order to cope with this problem, it has been proposed to electrically conduct the elastic member of the sealing member of the rolling bearing for wheel so that electrical conduction is made across the bearing and the shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The resistivity of the elastic member thus electrically-conducted is not specifically limited but is preferably not greater than 105 &OHgr;&middot;cm as calculated in terms of volume resistivity. When the resistivity of the elastic member falls within this range, radio noise can be sufficiently suppressed. The method for electrically conducting the elastic member is not specifically limited. In practice, however, the rubber composition may comprise an electrically-conductive powder or electrically-conductive fiber incorporated therein. Examples of the electrically-conductive powder employable herein include powder of metal such as brass, aluminum alloy, copper, silver, nickel, steel and stainless steel, powder of electrically-conductive material such as graphite, electrically-conductive carbon black, electrically-conductive tin oxide having tin oxide doped with antimony and electrically-conductive zinc oxide having zinc oxide doped with aluminum, and a powder of insulating material such as mica coated with an electrically-conductive material. Examples of the electrically-conductive fiber employable herein include carbon fiber, metal fiber (fiber made of brass, aluminum alloy, copper, silver, nickel, steel, stainless steel, etc.), and non-conductive fiber coated with an electrically-introducing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Among these electrically-conductive powders, an electrically-conductive carbon black having a highly grown graphite structure is desired because it little deteriorates the mechanical properties of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber or has little effect on the machinability thereof. Among these electrically-conductive carbon blacks, acetylene black and KETJENBLACK are even more desirable because they give excellent electrical conductivity even when used in a small amount. The amount of acetylene black and KETJENBLACK to be added is not specifically limited but is preferably from 2 to 40 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. When the amount of acetylene black and KETJENBLACK to be added falls below 2 parts by weight, sufficient electrical conductivity (volume resistivity of not greater than 10 &OHgr;&middot;cm) cannot be exhibited, providing no satisfactory results in the reduction of radio noise. On the contrary, when the amount of acetylene black and KETJENBLACK to be added exceeds 40 parts by weight, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits an extremely deteriorated moldability and thus can difficultly be formed into desired component. Further, the resulting carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibits too high a hardness and a low elongation and thus loses its inherent rubber elasticity. Moreover, the use of acetylene black and KETJENBLACK in combination with a so-called electrically-conductive whisker having a fine whisker coated with an electrically-conductive material makes it possible to extremely enhance the electrical conductivity to advantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The vulcanization based additives are loaded into the rubber material comprosition. As the vulcanization based additives, there are a vulcanizing agent (cross linking agent), a vulcanization accelerator, and a vulcanization accelerating assistant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As the vulcanizing agent (cross linking agent), listed are several kinds of sulfurs such as powder sulfur, flower of sulfur, precipitated sulfur, high dispersion sulfur; sulfur compounds enabling to generate sulfurs as morpholinedisulfide, alkylphenoldisulfide, N,N-dithiobis (hexahydro-2H-azepinon-2), thiurampolysulfide; and peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide, di (t-butylperoxide) diisopropylbenzene, 2, S-dimethyl-2, 5-di (benzoylperoxy) hexane, benzoylperoxide. Among them, from viewpoint of the dispersion, the easy management, and the heat resistant, it is desirable to use the high dispersion sulfur and morpholinedisulfide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For using the sulfur based vulcanizing agent, it is necessary to use the vulcanization accelerators such as guanidine based, aldehyde-ammonia based, thiazole based, sulfeneamide based, thiourea based, thiuram based, dithiocarbamate based, zantate based accelerators. Among them, if compounding a bit the high dispersion sulfur, it is desirable to cooperate with thiuram based tetramethylthiuram disulfide, sulfeneamide based N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazyl sulfenamide, and thiazole based 2-mercaptobenzothiazol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As the vulcanization accelerating assistant, there are metallic oxides as zinc oxide, metallic carbonate, metallic hydroxide, fatty acid as stearic acid and derivatives thereof and amines. Since the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber is easy to earlier generate the vulcanization by zinc oxide, a combination of zinc peroxide and stearic acid is preferable. The zinc peroxide exists as it is in the rubber material composition until temperature of kneading and processing the rubber material composition, and generates the zinc oxide when vulcanization-forming, and therefore it does not cause an early vulcanization when kneading and processing and when maintaining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> An organic peroxide-based vulcanizing agent can be used. Examples of the organic peroxide-based vulcanizing agent employable herein include dicumyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, t-butylcumyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexyne-3,2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(benzoylperoxy)hexane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy) hexane, 1,3-di(t-butylperoxyisopropyl)benzene, and 2,5-dimethyl(t-butylperoxyisopropyl)benzene. The amount of the organic peroxide-based vulcanizing agent is preferably from 0.5 to 5 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the compression set of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, a crosslinking aid (co-agent) may be used in combination with the organic peroxide-based vulcanizing agent. Examples of the crosslinking aid employable herein include tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate, ethylene dimethacrylate, 1,3-butylene dimethacrylate, 1,4-methylene dimethacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, 2,2&prime;-bis(4-methacryloxydiethoxyphenyl)propane, 2,2&prime;-bis(4-acryloxydiethoxyphenyl)propane, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, oligoester acrylate, aluminum (meth)acrylate, zinc (meth)acrylate, magnesium (meth)acrylate, calcium (meth)acrylate, triallyl isocyanurate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl trimellitate, diallyl phthalate, diallyl chlorendate, divinylbenzene, 2-vinylpyridine, N,N&prime;-methylenebisacrylamide, p-quinonedioxim, p,p&prime;-dibenzoylquinonedioxim, and 1,2-polybutadiene. The amount of these crosslinking aids to be incorporated is preferably from 1 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The age resister avoiding oxidizing deterioration will be referred to. As the age resister, enumerated are amine ketone condensation product, aromatic secondary amines, monophenol deviate, bis or polyphenol deviate, hydroquinone deviate, sulfur based age resister, phosphorus based age resister, and a wax such as micro-crystalline wax. Among them, especially preferable are amine ketone condensation product based 2,2,4-trimetyl-1,2-dihydroquindine copolymer, condensation product of diphenylamine and acetone, aromatic secondary amine based N,N&prime;-di-&bgr;-naphthyl-p-phenylenediamine, 4,4&prime;-bis (&agr;,&agr;-dimethylbenzil) diphenylamine, N-phenyl-N&prime;-(3-methacryloyloxy-2-hydroxylpropyl)-p-phenylenediamine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> For avoiding heat decomposition and improving the heat resistance, it is more preferable to cooperate a secondary age resister together with the above age resister. The secondary age resister is sulfur based 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, 2-mercaptomethylbenzimidazole, and zinc salts thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As sun-crack preventing agent restraining formation of cracks by the sunlight or ozone, waxes of the melting point being 55 to 70&deg; C. may be added 0.5 to 2 wt parts for 100 wt parts of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. Being less than 0.5 wt parts, an effect of preventing ozone cracks is hardly obtained, while being more than 2 wt parts, a problem will occur about the workability since unnecessary waxes bloom on the surface of the rubber material composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> If a formability should be heightened, a plasticizer as a processing aid is added other than the above additives. Being no matter about the forming, no additives are required. When adding the plasticizer, it is sufficient to add 3 to 20 wt parts for 100 wt parts of the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, and if the addition is more than a necessary amount, the rubber material composition is softened and at the same time the plasticizer is not completely mixed and might bleed out. Actual examples of the plasticizer are phthalic acid diester as dioctyl phthalate, polyester based plasticizer, polyetherester based plasticizer, and liquid nitrile rubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Next reference will be made to the properties of matter. The hardness of the rubber material composition is given influences by the addition amounts of the reinforcing filler or the abrasion improving agent, and from the viewpoint of a sealing property and a following property when applying to the sealing member of the rolling bearings for vehicles, the hardness of the rubber material composition is preferably 50 to 90 in the spring hardness A scale set forth in JIS K6301. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> If the hardness is less than 50, the contacting front end is deformed more than necessarily when the sealing member starts rotation. As a result, the abrasion resistance is large when the rolling element is driven, and a smooth rotation is difficult. Being more than 90, the rubber elasticity decreases as mentioned above, and the sealing property and the following property of the contacting front end go down at rotation movement. If using under an environment of much dusts, the life of the rolling element is probably lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The method for obtaining the rubber composition from the foregoing various components is not specifically limited. In practice, however, the carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, carbon black, and optionally silicone oil and other fillers and additives may be uniformly kneaded by means of a known conventional rubber kneader such as rubber kneading roll, pressure kneader and Banbury mixer. The kneading conditions are not specifically limited. In practice, however, these components may be kneaded normally at a temperature of from 30&deg; C. to 80&deg; C., or not lower than the melting point of a polyolefin, if added as a friction improver, for 5 to 60 minutes to allow the various additives to be thoroughly dispersed in the rubber composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The method for forming the rubber composition into the elastic member of the sealing member is not specifically limited. In practice, however, an unvulcanized rubber composition may be heated while being heated in a mold. In some detail, a known rubber molding method such as compression molding, transfer molding and injection may be employed. For example, when compression molding is employed, a core metal (which constitutes the core of the sealing member) coated with an adhesive is inserted in the mold. On the core metal is then placed an unvulcanized rubber composition sheet which has been prepared by the previously mentioned method. The unvulcanized rubber composition sheet can be then vulcanized under pressure normally at a temperature of from 120&deg; C. to 250&deg; C. for 3 minutes to 2 hours to prepare the desired elastic member. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The foregoing various materials were kneaded according to the formulation set forth in Table 1 using a pressure kneader and a kneading roll to prepare an unvulcanized rubber sheet having a thickness of 2.2 mm. Subsequently, the unvulcanized rubber sheet thus prepared was inserted in a mold having a length of 150 mm and a thickness of 2 mm. The unvulcanized rubber sheet was then subjected to vulcanization under a pressure of 50 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>under the vulcanization conditions-set forth in Tables 3 and 4. For Example 9 and Comparative Example 1, which were subjected to vulcanization with peroxide, and Comparative Example 4, which comprised fluororubber, the material was withdrawn from the mold, and then subjected to vulcanization in an oven under the secondary vulcanization conditions set forth in these tables. The vulcanized rubber sheets thus obtained were each then subjected to the following tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> (1) Hardness Test </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The vulcanized rubber sheet was punched into a shape according to JIS dumbbell No. 3 specimen. Three sheets of the test specimen were laminated, and then measured for hardness (A scale of spring hardness) according to JIS K6301. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> (2) Tensile Test </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The JIS dumbbell No. 3 test specimen was subjected to tensile test according to JIS K6301 using Autograph AG-10KNG (produced by Shimadzu Corp.) as a universal testing machine to measure tensile break strength and elongation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> (3) Abrasion/Friction Test </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Using a Type FEM-III-E abrasion/friction testing machine produced by Orientech Co., Ltd.), the test specimen was subjected to abrasion/friction test according to JIS K7218 plastic slide abrasion testing method A. The abrasion depth was calculated from the measurement of the surface shape of the specimen before and after testing. For the highest temperature and friction coefficient of the opposing material during testing, the values measured shortly before termination of testing were recorded. The testing conditions will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Sliding rate: 1 m/sec </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Face pressure: 0.15 MPa </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Opposing material: SUJ2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Surface roughness of opposing material: 0.4 &mgr;mRa </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Hardness of opposing material; HRC56-62 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Testing time: 24 hours </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The results are set forth in Tables 7 and 8. All the examples which comprise a rubber composition having carbon black and silicone oil incorporated in a carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibit excellent abrasion resistance and frictional characteristics and generate less heat as compared with the comparative examples which comprise an ordinary uncarboxylated nitrile rubber, hydrogenated nitrile rubber and fluororubber, the comparative examples which are free of carbon black and the comparative examples which comprise a lubricity providing agent other than silicone oil. The comparison of the examples shows that Example 3, which comprises a modified silicone oil, exhibits a low friction coefficient than Example 1, which comprises a straight silicone oil. It is also made obvious that Example 1,. which comprises an HAF class carbon black, exhibits a less abrasion than Example 2, which comprises an SRF class carbon black. It is further made obvious that Example 8, which comprises a polyolefin incorporated therein as an abrasion improver, exhibits lowest abrasion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> (Second Experiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> An oil seal having a shaft diameter of 165 mm having the same shape as that of the oil seal <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the sealing member of the rolling bearing for bearing the wheel of railway vehicle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> was prepared. In some detail, in a seal mold having a shape corresponding to the dust lip <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and the main lip <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>was inserted a reinforcing ring <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>made of cold rolled steel which had been cleaned, coated with an adhesive, and then baked. On the reinforcing ring <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>was then placed the same unvulcanized rubber sheet as used in the first experiment. The material was then subjected to vulcanization under a pressure of 30 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>under the same vulcanization conditions as used in the first experiment. Subsequently, using a seal rotary testing machine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, testing was conducted on the supposition that lubricant has run out. In the operation of the seal rotary testing machine shown, the shaft <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is rotated at a predetermined rotary speed with the oil seal <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>mounted thereon. The temperature of the main lip during rotation is measured by a thermocouple <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> disposed at a distance of 1 mm from the tip of the main lip <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. The properties measured are abrasion of main lip <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, rotary torque and temperature of heat generated. The measuring conditions were as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Rotary speed: 2,000 rpm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Testing time: 10 hrs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Testing temperature: Room temperature </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Shaft eccentricity: 0.1 mm TIR </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Lubricant: None </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> For the determination of abrasion of the main lip <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, the shape of the main lip <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>was measured before and after testing. The resulting area loss was then determined relative to that of Example 1 as 100. The temperature of heat generated is represented by its highest value. The torque is represented by its stabilized value measured 1 hour after the beginning of testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The results are set forth in Tables 3 and 4. All the examples which comprise a rubber composition having silicone oil incorporated in a carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibit excellent abrasion resistance of main lip and torque and generate less heat as compared with the comparative examples which comprise an ordinary uncarboxylated nitrite rubber, hydrogenated nitrite rubber and fluororubber, the comparative examples which are free of carbon black and the comparative examples which comprise a lubricity providing agent other than silicone oil. The comparison of the examples shows that Example 3, which comprises a modified silicone oil, exhibits a low friction coefficient than Example 1, which comprises a straight silicone oil. It is also made obvious that Example 1, which comprises an HAF class carbon black, exhibits a less abrasion of main lip than Example 2, which comprises an SRF class carbon black. It is further made obvious that Example 8, which comprises a polyolefin incorporated therein as an abrasion improver, exhibits lowest abrasion of main lip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> (Third Experiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> A sealing member having an inner diameter of 60 mm having the same shape as that of the sealing member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the rolling bearing for bearing the wheel of railway vehicle shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> was prepared. In some detail, in a seal mold was inserted a core metal <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> made of cold rolled steel which had been cleaned, coated with an adhesive, and then baked. On the core metal was then placed the same unvulcanized rubber sheet as used in the first experiment. The material was then subjected to vulcanization under a pressure of 30 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>under the same vulcanization conditions as used in the first experiment. Subsequently, using a seal rotary testing machine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, testing was conducted on the supposition that the test specimen is dipped in muddy water. In the operation of the seal rotary testing machine shown, the shaft <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is rotated at a predetermined rotary speed with the sealing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provided with a slinger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) mounted thereon while being dipped in muddy water <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> stored therein. The measuring conditions were as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Rotary speed: 800 rpm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Testing time; 48 hrs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Shaft eccentricity; 0.5 mm TIR </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Composition of muddy water: JIS 8 type dust; 10% </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Grease: Lithium soaps mineral oil </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Coated amount of grease: 1.0 g between outer seal lip and middle seal lip, 0.4 g between middle seal lip and inner seal lip </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Criterion for judgment: The water content in the grease applied to the gap between the outer seal lip and the inner seal lip was measured by Karl Fischer method. When the water content was not greater than 0.5%, the sealing properties were then judged excellent and represented by the symbol E. When the water content was not greater than 1%, the sealing properties were then judged good and represented by the symbol G. When the water content was from 2% to 5%, the sealing properties were then judged slightly poor and represented by the symbol F. When the water content was not smaller than 5%, the sealing properties were then judged poor and represented by the symbol P. The results are set forth in Tables 7 and 8.

<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in Tables 7 and 8, all the examples which comprise a rubber composition having silicone oil incorporated in a carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exhibit excellent sealing properties as compared with the comparative examples which comprise an ordinary uncarboxylated nitrile rubber, hydrogenated nitrile rubber and fluororubber, the comparative examples which are free of carbon black and the comparative examples which comprise a lubricity providing agent other than silicone oil. The comparison of the examples shows that Examples 3, 4, 6 and 8, which comprise a modified silicone oil, exhibit better sealing properties than Examples 1 and 2, which comprise a straight silicone oil. It is also made obvious that Example 8, which comprises a polyolefin incorporated therein as an abrasion improver, exhibits the best sealing properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the rolling bearing according to the invention comprises a sealing member comprising an elastic member formed by a vulcanizable rubber composition obtained by blending a carboxylated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber with at least carbon black as a filler and thus exhibits excellent sealing properties of sealing member and can maintain desired properties over an extended period of time even when used under severe conditions such that the rolling bearing is exposed to muddy water. Further, the addition of an electrical conductivity providing agent to the rubber composition makes it possible to provide the elastic member with a good electrical conductivity while maintaining desired sealing properties. Accordingly, the rolling bearing according to the invention can prevent the generation of radio noise when used for vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>
