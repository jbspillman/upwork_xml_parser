<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is concerned with the formation of small particles of organic compounds by precipitating the organic compounds in an aqueous medium to form a pre-suspension followed by adding energy to stabilize a coating of the particle or to alter the lattice structure of the particle. The process is preferably used to prepare a suspension of a poorly water-soluble, pharmaceutically active compound suitable for parenteral administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is an ever increasing number of pharmaceutical drugs being formulated that are poorly soluble or insoluble in aqueous solutions. Such drugs provide challenges to delivering them in an injectable form such as through parenteral administration. Drugs that are insoluble in water can have significant benefits when formulated as a stable suspension of sub-micron particles. Accurate control of particle size is essential for safe and efficacious use of these formulations. Particles must be less than seven microns in diameter to safely pass through capillaries without causing emboli (Allen et al., 1987; Davis and Taube, 1978; Schroeder et al., 1978; Yokel et al., 1981). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One approach to delivering an insoluble drug is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,745,785. This patent discloses a method for preparing crystals of penicillin G suitable for parenteral administration. The method includes the step of recrystallizing the penicillin G from a formamide solution by adding water to reduce the solubility of the penicillin G. The &apos;785 patent further provides that the penicillin G particles can be coated with wetting agents such as lecithin, or emulsifiers, surface-active and defoaming agents, or partial higher fatty acid esters of sorbitan or polyoxyalkyklene derivatives thereof, or aryl alkyl polyether alcohols or salts thereof. The &apos;785 patent further discloses micronizing the penicillin G with an air blast under pressure to form crystals ranging from about 5 to 20 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another approach is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,528 which discloses a process for preparing nanoparticles. The process includes the steps of: (1) preparing a liquid phase of a substance in a solvent or a mixture of solvents to which may be added one or more surfactants, (2) preparing a second liquid phase of a non-solvent or a mixture of non-solvents, the non-solvent is miscible with the solvent or mixture of solvents for the substance, (3) adding together the solutions of (1) and (2) with stirring; and (4) removing of unwanted solvents to produce a colloidal suspension of nanoparticles. The &apos;528 patent discloses that it produces particles of the substance smaller than 500 nm without the supply of energy. In particular the &apos;528 patent states that it is undesirable to use high energy equipment such as sonicators and homogenizers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,689 discloses a method for making uniformly sized particles from water-insoluble drugs or other organic compounds. First, a suitable solid organic compound is dissolved in an organic solvent, and the solution can be diluted with a non-solvent. Then, an aqueous precipitating liquid is infused, precipitating non-aggregated particles with substantially uniform mean diameter. The particles are then separated from the organic solvent. Depending on the organic compound and the desired particle size, the parameters of temperature, ratio of non-solvent to organic solvent, infusion rate, stir rate, and volume can be varied according to the invention. The &apos;689 patent discloses this process forms a drug in a metastable state which is thermodynamically unstable and which eventually converts to a more stable crystalline state. The &apos;689 patent discloses trapping the drug in a metastable state in which the free energy lies between that of the starting drug solution and the stable crystalline form. The &apos;689 patent discloses utilizing crystallization inhibitors (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidinone) and surface-active agents (e.g., poly(oxyethylene)-co-oxypropylene)) to render the precipitate stable enough to be isolated by centrifugation, membrane filtration or reverse osmosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,091,188; 5,091,187 and 4,725,442 which disclose (a) either coating small drug particles with natural or synthetic phospholipids or (b) dissolving the drug in a suitable lipophilic carrier and forming an emulsion stabilized with natural or semisynthetic phospholipids. One of the disadvantages of these approaches is they rely on the quality of the raw material of the drug and do not disclose steps of changing the morphology of the raw material to render the material in a friable, more easily processed form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another approach to providing insoluble drugs for parenteral delivery is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684. The &apos;684 patent discloses the wet milling of an insoluble drug in the presence of a surface modifier to provide a drug particle having an average effective particle size of less than 400 nm. The &apos;684 patent emphasizes the desirability of not using any solvents in its process. The &apos;684 patent discloses the surface modifier is adsorbed on the surface of the drug particle in an amount sufficient to prevent agglomeration into larger particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Yet another attempt to provide insoluble drugs for parenteral delivery is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,355. The &apos;355 patent discloses providing submicron sized particles of insoluble drugs using a combination of surface modifiers and a phospholipid followed by particle size reduction using techniques such as sonication, homogenization, milling, microfluidization, precipitation or recrystallization. There is no disclosure in the &apos;355 patent of changing process conditions to make crystals in a more friable form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,062 discloses a method of preparing small particles of insoluble drugs by (1) dissolving the drug in a water-miscible first solvent, (2) preparing a second solution of a polymer and an amphiphile in an aqueous second solvent in which the drug is substantially insoluble whereby a polymer/amphiphile complex is formed and (3) mixing the solutions from the first and second steps to precipitate an aggregate of the drug and polymer/amphiphile complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,410 discloses a pharmaceutical nanosuspension suitable for parenteral administration. The &apos;410 patent discloses subjecting at least one solid therapeutically active compound dispersed in a solvent to high pressure homogenization in a piston-gap homogenizer to form particles having an average diameter, determined by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) of 10 nm to 1000 nm, the proportion of particles larger than 5 &mgr;m in the total population being less than 0.1% (number distribution determined with a Coulter counter), without prior conversion into a melt, wherein the active compound is solid at room temperature and is insoluble, only sparingly soluble or moderately soluble in water, aqueous media and/or organic solvents. The Examples in the &apos;410 patent disclose jet milling prior to homogenization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,997,454 discloses a method for making uniformly sized particles from solid compounds. The method of the &apos;454 patent includes the steps of dissolving the solid compound in a suitable solvent followed by infusing precipitating liquid thereby precipitating non-aggregated particles with substantially uniform mean diameter. The particles are then separated from the solvent. The &apos;454 patent discourages forming particles in a crystalline state because during the precipitating procedure the crystal can dissolve and recrystallize thereby broadening the particle size distribution range. The &apos;454 patent encourages during the precipitating procedure to trap the particles in a metastable particle state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,785 discloses a process for forming nanoamorphous dispersions of photographically useful compounds. The process of forming nanoamorphous dispersions include any known process of emulsification that produces a disperse phase having amorphous particulates. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides processes to produce stable particles of an organic compound that are suitable for delivery intravenously. The processes can be divided into three separate categories based upon physical properties of the organic compound prior to and after adding energy to the organic compound through high shear agitation or heating or both. The three categories of processes each share the steps of: (1) dissolving the organic compound in a water-miscible first solvent to form a solution, (2) mixing the solution with a second solvent to define a pre-suspension, and (3) adding energy to the pre-suspension to form particles having an average effective particle size of less than about 7 &mgr;m, more preferably less than about 2 &mgr;m, more preferably from about 2 &mgr;m to 50 nm, and most preferably less than about 400 nm and even more preferably less than about 300 nm. The three categories of processes are distinguished based upon the physical properties of the organic compound as determined through x-ray diffraction studies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies or other suitable study conducted prior to the energy-addition step and after the energy-addition step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the first process category, prior to the energy-addition step the organic compound in the presuspension takes an amorphous form, a semi-crystalline form or a supercooled liquid form and has an average effective particle size. After the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form having an average effective particle size essentially the same as that of the presuspension and within the desired particle size ranges, namely having an average effective particle size of less than about 400 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the second process category, prior to the energy-addition step the organic compound in the presuspension is in a crystalline form and has an average effective particle size. After the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form having an average effective particle size essentially the same as that of the presuspension and within the desired particle size ranges, namely having an average effective particle diameter of less than about 400 nm. The particles after the energy-addition step have a reduced tendency to aggregate into larger particles when compared to particles of the presuspension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> What is meant by &ldquo;essentially the same size&rdquo; is the particles fall within the size range of less than about 400 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the third process category, prior to the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form that is friable and has an average effective particle size. After the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form having an average effective particle size smaller than the crystals of the pre-suspension. By taking the steps necessary to place the organic compound in a crystalline form that is friable, the subsequent energy-addition step can be carried out more quickly and efficiently when compared to an organic compound in a less friable crystalline morphology. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION: </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention is susceptible of embodiments in many different forms. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as exemplifications of the principles of the invention and are not intended to limit the broad aspects of the invention to the embodiments illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides methods or processes for forming particles of an organic compound having an average effective particle size suitable for parenteral administration and, in a most preferred form of the invention, is less than about 400 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The processes can be separated into three general categories. Each of the categories of processes share the steps of: (1) dissolving an organic compound in a water miscible first organic solvent to define a first solution, (2) mixing the first solution with a second solvent of water to precipitate the organic compound to define a pre-suspension, and (3) adding energy to the presuspension in the form of high-shear mixing or heat to provide a stable form of the organic compound having the desired size ranges defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The three categories of processes are distinguished based upon the physical properties of the organic compound as determined through x-ray diffraction studies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies or other suitable study conducted prior to the energy-addition step and after the energy-addition step. In the first process category, prior to the energy-addition step the organic compound in the presuspension takes an amorphous form, a semi-crystalline form or a supercooled liquid form and has an average effective particle size. After the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form having an average effective particle size essentially the same as that of the presuspension (i.e., from less than about 400 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the second process category, prior to the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form and has an average effective particle size. After the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form having essentially the same average effective particle size as prior to the energy-addition step but the crystals after the energy-addition step are less likely to aggregate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The lower tendency of the organic compound to aggregate is observed by laser dynamic light scattering and light microscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the third process category, prior to the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form that is friable and has an average effective particle size. What is meant by the term &ldquo;friable&rdquo; is that the particles are fragile and are more easily broken down into smaller particles. After the energy-addition step the organic compound is in a crystalline form having an average effective particle size smaller than the crystals of the pre-suspension. By taking the steps necessary to place the organic compound in a crystalline form that is friable, the subsequent energy-addition step can be carried out more quickly and efficiently when compared to an organic compound in a less friable crystalline morphology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The energy-addition step can be carried out in any fashion wherein the pre-suspension is exposed to cavitation, shearing or impact forces. In one preferred form of the invention, the energy-addition step is an annealing step. Annealing is defined in this invention as the process of converting matter that is thermodynamically unstable into a more stable form by single or repeated application of energy (direct heat or mechanical stress), followed by thermal relaxation. This lowering of energy may be achieved by conversion of the solid form from a less ordered to a more ordered lattice structure. Alternatively, this stabilization may occur by a reordering of the surfactant molecules at the solid-liquid interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> These three process categories will be discussed separately below. It should be understood, however, that the process conditions such as choice of surfactants or combination of surfactants, amount of surfactant used, temperature of reaction, rate of mixing of solutions, rate of precipitation and the like can be selected to allow for any drug to be processed under any one of the categories discussed next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The first process category, as well as the second and third process categories, can be further divided into two subcategories, Method A, and B shown diagramatically below.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An organic compound for use in the process of this invention is any organic chemical entity whose solubility decreases from one solvent to another.

The organic compound can be added from about 0.1% (w/v) to about 50% (w/v) depending on the solubility of the organic compound in the first solvent. Heating of the concentrate from about 30&deg; C. to about 100&deg; C. may be necessary to ensure total dissolution of the compound in the first solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A second aqueous solution is provided with one or more optional surface modifiers such as an anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant or a biological surface active molecule added thereto.

Suitable phospholipids include, for example phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, lysophospholipids, egg or soybean phospholipid or a combination thereof. The phospholipid may be salted or desalted, hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated or natural semisynthetic or synthetic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Suitable nonionic surfactants include: polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers (Macrogol and Brij), polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters (Polysorbates), polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters (Myrj), sorbitan esters (Span), glycerol monostearate, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, cetyl alcohol, cetostearyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, aryl alkyl polyether alcohols, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers (poloxomers), polaxamines, methylcellulose, hydroxycellulose, hydroxy propylcellulose, hydroxy propylmethylcellulose, noncrystalline cellulose, polysaccharides including starch and starch derivatives such as hydroxyethylstarch (HES), polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. In a preferred form of the invention the nonionic surfactant is a polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene copolymer and preferably a block copolymer of propylene glycol and ethylene glycol. Such polymers are sold under the tradename POLOXAMER also sometimes referred to as PLURONIC&reg;, and sold by several suppliers including Spectrum Chemical and Ruger. Among polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters is included those having short alkyl chains. One example of such a surfactant is SOLUTOL&reg; HS 15, polyethylene-660-hydroxystearate, manufactured by BASF Aktiengesellschaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Surface active biological molecules include such molecules as albumin, casein, heparin, hirudin or other appropriate proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It may also be desirable to add a pH adjusting agent to the second solution such as sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, tris buffer or citrate, acetate, lactate, meglumine, or the like. The second solution should have a pH within the range of from about 3 to about 11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a preferred form of the invention, the method for preparing submicron sized particles of an organic compound includes the steps of adding the first solution to the second solution. The addition rate is dependent on the batch size, and precipitation kinetics for the organic compound. Typically, for a small-scale laboratory process (preparation of 1 liter), the addition rate is from about 0.05 cc per minute to about 10 cc per minute. During the addition, the solutions should be under constant agitation. It has been observed using light microscopy that amorphous particles, semi-crystalline solids, or a supercooled liquid are formed to define a pre-suspension. The method further includes the step of subjecting the pre-suspension to an annealing step to convert the amorphous particles, supercooled liquid or semicrystalline solid to a crystalline more stable solid state. The resulting particles will have an average effective particles size as measured by dynamic light scattering methods (e.g., photocorrelation spectroscopy, laser diffraction, low-angle laser light scattering (LALLS), medium-angle laser light scattering (MALLS), light obscuration methods (Coulter method, for example), rheology, or microscopy (light or electron) within the ranges set forth above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The energy-addition step involves adding energy through sonication, homogenization, counter current flow homogenization, microfluidization, or other methods of providing impact, shear or cavitation forces. The sample may be cooled or heated during this stage. In one preferred form of the invention the annealing step is effected by a piston gap homogenizer such as the one sold by Avestin Inc. under the product designation EmulsiFlex-C160. In another preferred form of the invention the annealing may be accomplished by ultrasonication using an ultrasonic processor such as the Vibra-Cell Ultrasonic Processor (600W), manufactured by Sonics and Materials, Inc. In yet another preferred form of the invention the annealing may be accomplished by use of an emulsification apparatus as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,551 which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Depending upon the rate of annealing, it may be desirable to adjust the temperature of the processed sample to within the range of from approximately &minus;30&deg; C. to 30&deg; C. Alternatively, in order to effect a desired phase change in the processed solid, it may also be necessary to heat the pre-suspension to a temperature within the range of from about 30&deg; C. to about 100&deg; C. during the annealing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Method B </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Method B differs from Method A in the following respects. The first difference is a surfactant or combination of surfactants is added to the first solution. The surfactants may be selected from the groups of anionic, nonionic and cationic surfactants set forth above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Comparative Example of Method A and Method B and U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,062 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,062 discloses a process for preparing small particles of an organic compound by first dissolving the compound in a suitable water-miscible first solvent. A second solution is prepared by dissolving a polymer and an amphiphile in aqueous solution. The first solution is then added to the second solution to form a precipitate that consists of the organic compound and a polymer-amphiphile complex. The &apos;062 patent does not disclose utilizing the energy-addition step of this invention in Methods A and B. Lack of stability is typically evidenced by rapid aggregation and particle growth. In some instances, amorphous particles recrystallize as large crystals. Adding energy to the pre-suspension in the manner disclosed above typically affords particles that show decreased rates of particle aggregation and growth, as well as the absence of recrystallization upon product storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Methods A and B are further distinguished from the process of the &apos;062 patent by the absence of a step of forming a polymer-amphiphile complex prior to precipitation. In Method A, such a complex cannot be formed as no polymer is added to the diluent (aqueous) phase. In Method B, the surfactant, which may also act as an amphiphile, or polymer, is dissolved with the organic compound in the first solvent. This precludes the formation of any amphiphile-polymer complexes prior to precipitation. In the &apos;062 patent, successful precipitation of small particles relies upon the formation of an amphiphile-polymer complex prior to precipitation. The &apos;062 patent discloses the amphiphile-polymer complex forms aggregates in the aqueous second solution. The &apos;062 patent explains the hydrophobic organic compound interacts with the amphiphile-polymer complex, thereby reducing solubility of these aggregates and causing precipitation. In the present invention it has been demonstrated that the inclusion of the surfactant or polymer in the first solvent (Method B) leads, upon subsequent addition to second solvent, to formation of a more uniform, finer particulate than is afforded by the process outlined by the &apos;062 patent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> To this end, two formulations were prepared and analyzed. Each of the formulations have two solutions, a concentrate and an aqueous diluent, which are mixed together and then sonicated. The concentrate in each formulation has an organic compound (itraconazole), a water miscible solvent (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone or NMP) and possibly a polymer (poloxamer 188). The aqueous diluent has water, a tris buffer and possibly a polymer (poloxamer 188) and/or a surfactant (sodium deoxycholate). The average particle diameter of the organic particle is measured prior to sonication and after sonication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The first formulation A has as the concentrate itraconazole and NMP. The aqueous diluent includes water, poloxamer 188, tris buffer and sodium deoxycholate. Thus the aqueous diluent includes a polymer (poloxamer 188), and an amphiphile (sodium deoxycholate), which may form a polymer/amphiphile complex, and, therefore, is in accordance with the disclosure of the &apos;062 patent. (However, again the &apos;062 patent does not disclose an energy addition step.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The second formulation B has as the concentrate itraconazole, NMP and poloxamer 188. The aqueous diluent includes water, tris buffer and sodium deoxycholate. This formulation is made in accordance with the present invention. Since the aqueous diluent does not contain a combination of a polymer (poloxamer) and an amphiphile (sodium deoxycholate), a polymer/amphiphile complex cannot form prior to the mixing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows the average particle diameters measured by laser diffraction on three replicate suspension preparations. An initial size determination was made, after which the sample was sonicated for 1 minute. The size determination was then repeated. The large size reduction upon sonication of Method A was indicative of particle aggregation.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A drug suspension resulting from application of the processes described in this invention may be administered directly as an injectable solution, provided Water for Injection is used in formulation and an appropriate means for solution sterilization is applied. Sterilization may be accomplished by separate sterilization of the drug concentrate (drug, solvent, and optional surfactant) and the diluent medium (water, and optional buffers and surfactants) prior to mixing to form the pre-suspension. Sterilization methods would include pre-filtration first through a 3.0 micron filter followed by filtration through a 0.45-micron particle filter, followed by steam or heat sterilization or sterile filtration through two redundant 0.2-micron membrane filters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a solvent-free suspension may be produced by solvent removal after precipitation. This can be accomplished by centrifugation, dialysis, diafiltration, force-field fractionation, high-pressure filtration or other separation techniques well known in the art. Complete removal of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone was typically carried out by one to three successive centrifugation runs; after each centrifugation (18,000 rpm for 30 minutes) the supernatant was decanted and discarded. A fresh volume of the suspension vehicle without the organic solvent was added to the remaining solids and the mixture was dispersed by homogenization. It will be recognized by others skilled in the art that other high-shear mixing techniques could be applied in this reconstitution step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, any undesired excipients such as surfactants may be replaced by a more desirable excipient by use of the separation methods described in the above paragraph. The solvent and first excipient may be discarded with the supernatant after centrifugation or filtration. A fresh volume of the suspension vehicle without the solvent and without the first excipient may then be added. Alternatively, a new surfactant may be added. For example, a suspension consisting of drug, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (solvent), poloxamer 188 (first excipient), sodium deoxycholate, glycerol and water may be replaced with phospholipids (new surfactant), glycerol and water after centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> I. First Process Category </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The methods of the first process category generally include the step of dissolving the organic compound in a water miscible first solvent followed by the step of mixing this solution with an aqueous solution to form a presuspension wherein the organic compound is in an amorphous form, a semicrystalline form or in a supercooled liquid form as determined by x-ray diffraction studies, DSC, light microscopy or other analytical techniques and has an average effective particle size within one of the effective particle size ranges set forth above. The mixing step is followed by an energy-addition step and, in a preferred form of the invention an annealing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> II. Second Process Category </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The methods of the second processes category include essentially the same steps as in the steps of the first processes category but differ in the following respect. An x-ray diffraction, DSC or other suitable analytical techniques of the presuspension shows the organic compound in a crystalline form and having an average effective particle size. The organic compound after the energy-addition step has essentially the same average effective particle size as prior to the energy-addition step but has less of a tendency to aggregate into larger particles when compared to that of the particles of the presuspension. Without being bound to a theory, it is believed the differences in the particle stability may be due to a reordering of the surfactant molecules at the solid-liquid interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> III. Third Process Category </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The methods of the third category modify the first two steps of those of the first and second processes categories to ensure the organic compound in the presuspension is in a friable form having an average effective particle size (e.g., such as slender needles and thin plates). Friable particles can be formed by selecting suitable solvents, surfactants or combination of surfactants, the temperature of the individual solutions, the rate of mixing and rate of precipitation and the like. Friability may also be enhanced by the introduction of lattice defects (e.g., cleavage planes) during the steps of mixing the first solution with the aqueous solution. This would arise by rapid crystallization such as that afforded in the precipitation step. In the energy-addition step these friable crystals are converted to crystals that are kinetically stabilized and having an average effective particle size smaller than those of the presuspension. Kinetically stabilized means particles have a reduced tendency to aggregate when compared to particles that are not kinetically stabilized. In such instance the energy-addition step results in a breaking up of the friable particles. By ensuring the particles of the presuspension are in a friable state, the organic compound can more easily and more quickly be prepared into a particle within the desired size ranges when compared to processing an organic compound where the steps have not been taken to render it in a friable form.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of Itraconazole Suspension by Use of Process Category 1, Method A with Homogenization </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To a 3-L flask add 1680 mL of Water for Injection. Heat liquid to 60-65&deg; C., and then slowly add 44 grams of Pluronic F-68 (poloxamer 188), and 12 grams of sodium deoxycholate, stirring after each addition to dissolve the solids. After addition of solids is complete, stir for another 15 minutes at 60-65&deg; C. to ensure complete dissolution. Prepare a 50 mM tris (tromethamine) buffer by dissolving 6.06 grams of tris in 800 mL of Water for Injection. Titrate this solution to pH 8.0 with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Dilute the resulting solution to 1 liter with additional Water for Injection. Add 200 mL of the tris buffer to the poloxamer/deoxycholate solution. Stir thoroughly to mix solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a 150-mL beaker add 20 grams of itraconazole and 120 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. Heat mixture to 50-60&deg; C., and stir to dissolve solids. After total dissolution is visually apparent, stir another 15 minutes to ensure complete dissolution. Cool itraconazole-NMP solution to room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Charge a syringe pump (two 60-mL glass syringes) with the 120-mL of itraconazole solution prepared previously. Meanwhile pour all of the surfactant solution into a homogenizer hopper which has been cooled to 0-5&deg; C. (this may either by accomplished by use of a jacketed hopper through which refrigerant is circulated, or by surrounding the hopper with ice). Position a mechanical stirrer into the surfactant solution so that the blades are fully immersed. Using the syringe pump, slowly (1-3 mL/min) add all of the itraconazole solution to the stirred, cooled surfactant solution. A stirring rate of at least 700 rpm is recommended. An aliquot of the resulting suspension (Suspension A) is analyzed by light microscopy (Hoffman Modulation Contrast) and by laser diffraction (Horiba). Suspension A is observed by light microscopy to consist of roughly spherical amorphous particles (under 1 micron), either bound to each other in aggregates or freely moving by Brownian motion. See FIG. 3. Dynamic light scattering measurements typically afford a bimodal distribution pattern signifying the presence of aggregates (10-100 microns in size) and the presence of single amorphous particles ranging 200-700 nm in median particle diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The suspension is immediately homogenized (at 10,000 to 30,000 psi) for 10-30 minutes. At the end of homogenization, the temperature of the suspension in the hopper does not exceed 75&deg; C. The homogenized suspension is collected in 500-mL bottles, which are cooled immediately in the refrigerator (2-8&deg; C.). This suspension (Suspension B) is analyzed by light microscopy and is found to consist of small elongated plates with a length of 0.5 to 2 microns and a width in the 0.2-1 micron range. See FIG. 4. Dynamic light scattering measurements typically indicate a median diameter of 200-700 nm.

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> During microscopic examination of the aliquot of Suspension A, crystallization of the amorphous solid was directly observed. Suspension A was stored at 2-8&deg; C. for 12 hours and examined by light microscopy. Gross visual inspection of the sample revealed severe flocculation, with some of the contents settling to the bottom of the container. Microscopic examination indicated the presence of large, elongated, plate-like crystals over 10 microns in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Stability of Suspension B </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As opposed to the instability of Suspension A, Suspension B was stable at 2-8&deg; C. for the duration of the preliminary stability study (1 month). Microscopy on the aged sample clearly demonstrated that no significant change in the morphology or size of the particles had occurred. This was confirmed by light scattering measurement. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of Itraconazole Suspension by Use of Process Category 1, Method A with Ultrasonication </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> To a 500-mL stainless steel vessel add 252 mL of Water for Injection. Heat liquid to 60-65&deg; C., and then slowly add 6.6 grams of Pluronic F-68 (poloxamer 188), and 0.9 grams of sodium deoxycholate, stirring after each addition to dissolve the solids. After addition of solids is complete, stir for another 15 minutes at 60-65&deg; C. to ensure complete dissolution. Prepare a 50 mM tris (tromethamine) buffer by dissolving 6.06 grams of tris in 800 mL of Water for Injection. Titrate this solution to pH 8.0 with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Dilute the resulting solution to 1 liter with additional Water for Injection. Add 30 mL of the tris buffer to the poloxamer/deoxycholate solution. Stir thoroughly to mix solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In a 30-mL container add 3 grams of itraconazole and 18 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. Heat mixture to 50-60&deg; C., and stir to dissolve solids. After total dissolution is visually apparent, stir another 15 minutes to ensure complete dissolution. Cool itraconazole-NMP solution to room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Charge a syringe pump with 18-mL of itraconazole solution prepared in a previous step. Position a mechanical stirrer into the surfactant solution so that the blades are fully immersed. Cool the container to 0-5&deg; C. by immersion in an ice bath. Using the syringe pump, slowly (1-3 mL/min) add all of the itraconazole solution to the stirred, cooled surfactant solution. A stirring rate of at least 700 rpm is recommended. Immerse an ultrasonicator horn in the resulting suspension so that the probe is approximately 1 cm above the bottom of the stainless steel vessel. Sonicate (10,000 to 25,000 Hz, at least 400W) for 15 to 20 minute in 5-minute intervals. After the first 5-minute sonication, remove the ice bath and proceed with further sonication. At the end of ultrasonication, the temperature of the suspension in the vessel does not exceed 75&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The suspension is collected in a 500-mL Type I glass bottle, which is cooled immediately in the refrigerator (2-8&deg; C.). Characteristics of particle morphology of the suspension before and after sonication were very similar to that seen in Method A before and after homogenization (see Example 1). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Prepare a 50 mM tris (tromethamine) buffer by dissolving 6.06 grams of tris in 800 mL of Water for Injection. Titrate this solution to pH 8.0 with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Dilute the resulting solution to 1 liter with additional Water for Injection. To a 3-L flask add 1680 mL of Water for Injection. Add 200 mL of the tris buffer to the 1680 mL of water. Stir thoroughly to mix solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In a 150-mL beaker add 44 grams of Pluronic F-68 (poloxamer 188) and 12 grams of sodium deoxycholate to 120 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. Heat the mixture to 50-60&deg; C., and stir to dissolve solids. After total dissolution is visually apparent, stir another 15 minutes to ensure complete dissolution. To this solution, add 20 grams of itraconazole, and stir until totally dissolved. Cool the itraconazole-surfactant-NMP solution to room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Charge a syringe pump (two 60-mL glass syringes) with the 120-mL of the concentrated itraconazole solution prepared previously. Meanwhile pour the diluted tris buffer solution prepared above into a homogenizer hopper which has been cooled to 0-5&deg; C. (this may either by accomplished by use of a jacketed hopper through which refrigerant is circulated, or by surrounding the hopper with ice). Position a mechanical stirrer into the buffer solution so that the blades are fully immersed. Using the syringe pump, slowly (1-3 mL/min) add all of the itraconazole-surfactant concentrate to the stirred, cooled buffer solution. A stirring rate of at least 700 rpm is recommended. The resulting cooled suspension is immediately homogenized (at 10,000 to 30,000 psi) for 10-30 minutes. At the end of homogenization, the temperature of the suspension in the hopper does not exceed 75&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The homogenized suspension is collected in 500-mL bottles, which are cooled immediately in the refrigerator (2-8&deg; C.). Characteristics of particle morphology of the suspension before and after homogenization were very similar to that seen in Example 1, except that in process category 1 B, the pre-homogenized material tended to form fewer and smaller aggregates which resulted in a much smaller overall particle size as measured by laser diffraction. After homogenization, dynamic light scattering results were typically identical to those presented in Example 1. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of Itraconazole Suspension by Use of Process Category 1, Method B with Ultrasonication </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> To a 500-mL flask add 252 mL of Water for Injection. Prepare a 50 mM tris (tromethamine) buffer by dissolving 6.06 grams of tris in 800 mL of Water for Injection. Titrate this solution to pH 8.0 with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Dilute the resulting solution to 1 liter with additional Water for Injection. Add 30 mL of the tris buffer to the water. Stir thoroughly to mix solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In a 30-mL beaker add 6.6 grams of Pluronic F-68 (poloxamer 188) and 0.9 grams of sodium deoxycholate to 18 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. Heat the mixture to 50-60&deg; C., and stir to dissolve solids. After total dissolution is visually apparent, stir another 15 minutes to ensure complete dissolution. To this solution, add 3.0 grams of itraconazole, and stir until totally dissolved. Cool the itraconazole-surfactant-NMP solution to room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Charge a syringe pump (one 30-mL glass syringe with the 18-mL of the concentrated itraconazole solution prepared previously. Position a mechanical stirrer into the buffer solution so that the blades are fully immersed. Cool the container to 0-5&deg; C. by immersion in an ice bath. Using the syringe pump, slowly (1-3 mL/min) add all of the itraconazole-surfactant concentrate to the stirred, cooled buffer solution. A stirring rate of at least 700 rpm is recommended. The resulting cooled suspension is immediately sonicated (10,000 to 25,000 Hz, at least 400 W) for 15-20 minutes, in 5-minute intervals. After the first 5-minute sonication, remove the ice bath and proceed with further sonication. At the end of ultrasonication, the temperature of the suspension in the hopper does not exceed 75&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The resultant suspension is collected in a 500-mL bottle, which is cooled immediately in the refrigerator (2-8&deg; C.). Characteristics of particle morphology of the suspension before and after sonication were very similar to that seen in Example 1, except that in Process Category 1, Method B, the pre-sonicated material tended to form fewer and smaller aggregates which resulted in a much smaller overall particle size as measured by laser diffraction. After ultrasonication, dynamic light scattering results were typically identical to those presented in Example 1. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of Itraconazole Suspension (1%) with 0.75% Solutol&reg; HR (PEG-660 12-hydroxystearate) Process Category 2, Method B </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Solutol (2.25 g) and itraconazole (3.0 g) were weighed into a beaker and 36 mL of filtered N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) was added. This mixture was stirred under low heat (up to 40&deg; C.) for approximately 15 minutes until the solution ingredients were dissolved. The solution was cooled to room temperature and was filtered through a 0.2-micron filter under vacuum. Two 60-mL syringes were filled with the filtered drug concentrate and were placed in a syringe pump. The pump was set to deliver approximately 1 ml/min of concentrate to a rapidly stirred (400 rpm) aqueous buffer solution. The buffer solution consisted of 22 &mgr;L of glycerol in 5 mM tris buffer. Throughout concentrate addition, the buffer solution was kept in an ice bath at 2-3&deg; C. At the end of the precipitation, after complete addition of concentrate to the buffer solution, about 100 mL of the suspension was centrifuged for 1 hour, the supernatant was discarded. The precipitate was resuspended in a 20% NMP solution in water, and again centrifuged for 1 hour. The material was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 25&deg; C. The dried material was transferred to a vial and analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (see FIG. 5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Another 100 mL-aliquot of the microprecipitated suspension was sonicated for 30 minutes at 20,000 Hz, 80% full amplitute (full amplitude&equals;600 W). The sonicated sample was homogenized in 3 equal aliquots each for 45 minutes (Avestin C5, 2-5&deg; C., 15,000-20,000 psi). The combined fractions were centrifuged for about 3 hours, the supernatant removed, and the precipitate resuspended in 20% NMP. The resuspended mixture was centrifuged again (15,000 rpm at 5&deg; C.). The supernatant was decanted off and the precipitate was vacuum dried overnight at 25&deg; C. The precipitate was submitted for analysis by X-ray diffractometry (see FIG. 5). As seen in FIG. 5, the X-ray diffraction patterns of processed samples, before and after homogenization, are essentially identical, yet show a significantly different pattern as compared with the starting raw material. The unhomogenized suspension is unstable and agglomerates upon storage at room temperature. The stabilization that occurs as a result of homogenization is believed to arise from rearrangement of surfactant on the surface of the particle. This rearrangement should result in a lower propensity for particle aggregation.

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> 2.08 g of carbamazepine was dissolved into 10 mL of NMP. 1.0 mL of this concentrate was subsequently dripped at 0.1 mL/min into 20 mL of a stirred solution of 1.2% lecithin and 2.25% glycerin. The temperature of the lecithin system was held at 2-5&deg; C. during the entire addition. The predispersion was next homogenized cold (5-15&deg; C.) for 35 minutes at 15,000 psi. The pressure was increased to 23,000 psi and the homogenization was continued for another 20 minutes. The particles produced by the process had a mean diameter of 0.881 &mgr;m with 99% of the particles being less than 2.44 um. </paragraph>

The microprecipitation step involved adding the drug concentrate to the receiving solution (distilled water) at a rate of 0.1 mL/min. The receiving solution was stirred and maintained at approximately 5&deg; C. during precipitation. After precipitation, the final ingredient concentrations were 1% carbamazepine and 0.125% Solutol&reg;. The drug crystals were examined under a light microscope using positive phase contrast (400X). The precipitate consisted of fine needles approximately 2 microns in diameter and ranging from 50-150 microns in length. </paragraph>

Laser diffraction analysis (Horiba) of the homogenized material showed that the particles had a mean size of 0.4 micron with 99% of the particles less than 0.8 micron. Low energy sonication, suitable for breaking agglomerated particles, but not with sufficient energy to cause a cominution of individual particles, of the sample before Horiba analysis had no effect on the results (numbers were the same with and without sonication). This result was consistent with the absence of particle agglomeration. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A drug concentrate comprising 20% carbamazepine and 5% glycodeoxycholate in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone was prepared. The microprecipitation step involved adding the drug concentrate to the receiving solution (distilled water) at a rate of 0.1 mL/min. Thus, this and the following examples demonstrate that adding a surfactant or other excipient to the aqueous precipitating solution in Methods A and B above is optional. The receiving solution was stirred and maintained at approximately 5&deg; C. during precipitation. After precipitation, the final ingredient concentrations were 1% carbamazepine and 0.125% Solutol&reg;. The drug crystals were examined under a light microscope using positive phase contrast (400&times;). The precipitate consisted of fine needles approximately 2 microns in diameter and ranging from 50-150 microns in length. Comparison of the precipitate with the raw material before precipitation reveals that the precipitation step in the presence of surface modifier (glycodeoxycholic acid) results in very slender crystals that are much thinner than the starting raw material (see FIG. 6). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of 1.6% (w/v) Prednisolone Suspension with 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate and 3% N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone Process Category 3, Method B </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A schematic of the overall manufacturing process is presented in FIG. 8. A concentrated solution of prednisolone and sodium deoxycholate was prepared. Prednisolone (32 g) and sodium deoxycholate (1 g) were added to a sufficient volume of 1-methyl 2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) to produce a final volume of 60 mL. The resulting prednisolone concentration was approximately 533.3 mg/mL and the sodium deoxycholate concentration was approximately 16.67 mg/mL. 60 mL of NMP concentrate was added to 2 L of water cooled to 5&deg; C. at an addition rate of 2.5 mL/min while stirring at approximately 400 rpm. The resulting suspension contained slender needle-shaped crystals less than 2 &mgr;m in width (FIG. 9). The concentration contained in the precipitated suspension was 1.6% (w/v) prednisolone, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, and 3% NMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The precipitated suspension was pH adjusted to 7.5-8.5 using sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid then homogenized (Avestin C-50 piston-gap homogenizer) for 10 passes at 10,000 psi. The NMP was removed by performing 2 successive centrifugation steps replacing the supernatant each time with a fresh surfactant solution, which contained the desired concentrations of surfactants needed to stabilize the suspension (see Table 2). The suspension was homogenized for another 10 passes at 10,000 psi. The final suspension contained particles with a mean particle size of less than 1 lm, and 99% of particles less than 2 &mgr;m. FIG. 10 is a photomicrograph of the final prednisolone suspension after homogenization. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> 32 g of prednisolone was dissolved into 40 mL of NMP. Gentle heating at 40-50&deg; C. was required to effect dissolution. The drug NMP concentrate was subsequently dripped at 2.5 mL/min into 2 liters of a stirred solution that consisted of 0.1.2% lecithin and 2.2% glycerin. No other surface modifiers were added. The surfactant system was buffered at pH 8.0 with 5 mM tris buffer and the temperature was held at 0&deg; to 5&deg; C. during the entire precipitation process. The post-precipitated dispersion was next homogenized cold (5-15&deg; C.) for 20 passes at 10,000 psi. Following homogenization, the NMP was removed by centrifuging the suspension, removing the supernatant, and replacing the supernatant with fresh surfactant solution. This post-centrifuged suspension was then rehomogenized cold (5-15&deg; C.) for another 20 passes at 10,000 psi. The particles produced by this process had a mean diameter of 0.927 um with 99% of the particles being less than 2.36 um. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of 1% Itraconazole Suspension with Poloxamer with Particles of a Mean Diameter of Approximately 220 nm </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Itraconazole concentrate was prepared by dissolving 10.02 grams of itraconazole in 60 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. Heating to 70&deg; C. was required to dissolve the drug. The solution was then cooled to room temperature. A portion of 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer (tris buffer) was prepared and was pH adjusted to 8.0 with 5M hydrochloric acid. An aqueous surfactant solution was prepared by combining 22 g/L poloxamer 407, 3.0 g/L egg phosphatides, 22 g/L glycerol, and 3.0 g/L sodium cholate dihydrate. 900 mL of the surfactant solution was mixed with 100 mL of the tris buffer to provide 1000 mL of aqueous diluent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The aqueous diluent was added to the hopper of the homogenizer (APV Gaulin Model 15MR-8TA), which was cooled by using an ice jacket. The solution was rapidly stirred (4700 rpm) and the temperature was monitored. The itraconazole concentrate was slowly added, by use of a syringe pump, at a rate of approximately 2 mL/min. Addition was complete after approximately 30 minute. The resulting suspension was stirred for another 30 minutes while the hopper was still being cooled in an ice jacket, and an aliquot was removed for analysis by light microscopy any dynamic light scatting. The remaining suspension was subsequently homogenized for 15 minutes at 10,000 psi. By the end of the homogenization the temperature had risen to 74&deg; C. The homogenized suspension was collected in a 1-L Type I glass bottle and sealed with a rubber closure. The bottle containing suspension was stored in a refrigerator at 5&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> A sample of the suspension before homogenization showed the sample to consist of both free particles, clumps of particles, and multilamellar lipid bodies. The free particles could not be clearly visualized due to Brownian motion; however, many of the aggregates appeared to consist of amorphous, non-crystalline material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The homogenized sample contained free submicron particles having excellent size homogeneity without visible lipid vesicles. Dynamic light scattering showed a monodisperse logarithmic size distribution with a median diameter of approximately 220 nm. The upper 99% cumulative size cutoff was approximately 500 nm. FIG. 11 shows a comparison of the size distribution of the prepared nanosuspension with that of a typical parenteral fat emulsion product (10% Intralipid&reg;, Pharmacia).

<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> After complete addition, the resulting suspension was sonicated (Cole-Parmer Ultrasonic Processor -20,000 Hz, 80% amplitude setting) while still being cooled in the ice bath. A one-inch solid probe was utilized. Sonication was continued for 5 minutes. The ice bath was removed, the probe was removed and retuned, and the probe was again immersed in the suspension. The suspension was sonicated again for another 5 minutes without the ice bath. The sonicator probe was once again removed and retuned, and after immersion of the probe the sample was sonicated for another 5 minutes. At this point, the temperature of the suspension had risen to 82&deg; C. The suspension was quickly cooled again in an ice bath and when it was found to be below room temperature it was poured into a Type I glass bottle and sealed. Microscopic visualization of the particles indicated individual particle sizes on the order of one micron or less. </paragraph>
