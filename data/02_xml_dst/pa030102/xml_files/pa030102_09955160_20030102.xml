<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-137165, filed May 8, 2001, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a programming method for a non-volatile semiconductor memory device formed from twin memory cells each being equipped with one word gate and two non-volatile memory elements controlled by two control gates. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There is known a MONOS (Metal-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Semiconductor or -Substrate) type non-volatile semiconductor device in which a gate dielectric layer between a channel and a gate is formed from a stacked body including a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, and a silicon oxide film, and charge is trapped in the silicon nitride film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A MONOS-type non-volatile semiconductor memory device is described in a reference (Y. Hayashi, et al., 2000 Symposium on VLSI Technology, Digest of Technical Papers, p. 122-p. 123). The reference describes a twin MONOS flash memory cell equipped with one word gate and two non-volatile memory elements (MONOS memory elements or cells) controlled by two control gates. In other words, one flash memory cell includes two charge trap sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A plurality of twin MONOS flash memory cells each having the structure described above are arranged in the row direction and the column direction in multiple rows and columns to form a memory cell array region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Two bit lines, one word line, and two control gate lines are required to drive a MONOS flash memory cell- However, when driving a plurality of twin memory cells, these lines can be commonly connected for different control gates if they are set at the same potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Operations of this type of flash memory include erasing, programming, and reading data. Normally, data programming or data reading is performed at selected cells (selected non-volatile memory elements) in units of 8 bits or 16 bits simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is noted that, in the MONOS flash memory, a plurality of twin MONOS flash memory cells that are not mutually isolated are connected to one word line. For programming data at a specified selected cell, not only must the voltage of a twin MONOS flash memory including the selected cell be appropriately set, but also the voltage of an adjacent twin MONOS flash memory cell must be appropriately set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the non-volatile memory of the type described above experiences a problem of data disturbance. The data disturb means disturbance of data at an unselected cell (unselected non-volatile memory element). When a selected cell is programmed by applying a high voltage to the control gate line and the bit line for the selected cell, the high voltage is also applied to the unselected cell due to the commonly shared wiring. When this situation is repeated for each programming, data disturbance occurs; in other words, the unselected cell is programmed or its data is erased. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a programming method for a non-volatile semiconductor memory device, in which, when data is programmed at a selected cell, voltages are appropriately set for a twin memory cell including the selected cell and an adjacent twin memory cell to thereby prevent disturbance at unselected cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a programming method in which a plurality of twin memory cells, each having one word gate and first and second non-volatile memory elements controlled by first and second control gates, are arranged and, from among three adjacent twin memory cells (i&minus;1), (i), and (i&plus;1) whose word gates are connected to one word line, data for the second non-volatile memory element of the twin memory cell (i) is programmed, comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> setting the word line to a programming word line selection voltage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> setting the second control gate of the twin memory cell (i) and the first control gate of the twin memory cell (i&plus;1) to a programming control gate voltage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> setting the second control gate of the twin memory cell (i&minus;1) and the first control gate of the twin memory cell (i) to an over-ride voltage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> setting a bit line commonly connected to the second non-volatile memory element of the twin memory cell (i) and the first non-volatile memory element of the twin memory cell (i&plus;1) to a programming bit line voltage; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> setting a bit line connected to the second non-volatile memory element of the twin memory cell (i&plus;1) to a voltage higher than 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a programming method in which a plurality of twin memory cells, each having one word gate and first and second non-volatile memory elements controlled by first and second control gates, are arranged and, from among three adjacent twin memory cells (i&minus;1), (i), and (i&plus;1) whose word gates are connected to one word line, data for the first non-volatile memory element of the twin memory cell (i) is programmed, comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> setting the word line to a programming word line selection voltage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> setting the second control gate of the twin memory cell (i&minus;1) and the first control gate of the twin memory cell (i) to a programming control gate voltage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> setting the second control gate of the twin memory cell (i) and the first control gate of the twin memory cell (i&plus;1) to an over-ride voltage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> setting a bit line commonly connected to the second non-volatile memory element of the twin memory cell (i&minus;1) and the first non-volatile memory element of the twin memory cell (i) to a programming bit line voltage; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> setting a bit line connected to the first non-volatile memory element of the twin memory cell (i&minus;1) to a voltage higher than 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In both of the embodiments described above, a potential difference between a source and a drain (bit lines) of an unselected twin memory cell adjacent to a selected cell (selected non-volatile memory element) in which data is programmed is made smaller, thus preventing punch-through current at the unselected twin memory cell, such that disturbance at the unselected cell (unselected non-volatile memory element) can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Also, the voltage higher than 0 volt that is set at the bit line may preferably be equal to or greater than the programming word line selection voltage. As a result, a transistor section including the word gate in a unselected twin memory cell adjacent to a selected cell is difficult to turn on, such that the flow of punch-through current is prevented. As a result. this too prevents disturbance from occurring at the unselected cell adjacent to the selected cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Also, in both of the embodiments described above, current that flows in the bit line during programming is restricted by the constant current source, such that the voltage for the bit line can be properly set and the programming operation can be securely performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the programming word line selection voltage may preferably be set to a voltage that is high enough to be able to cause a current greater than a current provided by the constant current source to flow between a source and a drain of the selected twin memory cell. As a result, the current that flows in the bit line during programming is also restricted at a constant level by the constant current source, such that the voltage for the bit line can be properly set and the programming operation can be securely performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the programming word line selection voltage is set at a high level, disturbance at an unselected cell readily occurs. However, a potential difference between a source and a drain of a unselected cell is reduced as described above, and disturbance at the unselected cell can be prevented, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Each of the first and second non-volatile memory elements may include an ONO film formed from an oxide film (O), a nitride film (N) and an oxide film (O), which can be used as a charge trap site, but can have any other structure without being restricted to the structure described above.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Reading Data from Memory Cell </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> One twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be typified, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, as having a transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> driven by the word gate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which are respectively driven by the first and second control gates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>B and which are serially connected to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Before describing the operation of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, description is first made with respect to setting potentials on certain sections of three adjacent twin memory cells <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb;, &lsqb;i&rsqb;, &lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; and &lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; in a selected block (a selected small block <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>) in, for example, the sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an illustration to be used to describe the case of reading data in a reverse mode from the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell) on the right side of the word gate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb; that is connected. to the word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows voltages set at the selected block at that time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In this case, a read word line selection voltage Vdd (for example, 1.8 V) is applied to the word gate WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is present in the same row as the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb; to thereby turn on the transistors T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on that row. Also, an over-ride voltage (for example, 3 V) is applied through the sub-control gate line SCG&lsqb;i&rsqb; to the control gate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>A on the left side (of an opposite cell) of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb; to thereby turn on the transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A read voltage Vread (for example, 1.5 V) is applied as a voltage VCG of the control gate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>B on the right side of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> At this moment, depending on whether or not charge is stored in the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell) on the right side of the word gate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the transistor T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> corresponding to the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B operates differently, as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the relation between voltages applied to the control gate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>B on the right side (the selected cell side) of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb; and currents Ids that flow between the source and the drain of the transistor T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> corresponding to the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell) controlled by the applied voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, when charge is not stored in the MOMOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell), the current Ids starts flowing when the control gate voltage VCG exceeds a low threshold voltage Vlow. In contrast, when charge is stored in the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell), the current Ids does not start flowing unless the control gate potential VCG on the selected side exceeds a high threshold voltage Vhigh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the voltage Vread, which is applied to the control gate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>B on the selected side when data is read. is set at a substantially intermediate voltage between the two threshold voltages Vlow and Vhigh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when charge is not Stored in the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell) , the current Ids flows, and when charge is stored in the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell), the current Ids does not flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Here, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, when data is read, the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb; (impurity layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb;) connected to the opposite cell is connected to a sense amplifier, and potentials VD&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb;, &lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; and &lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; on the other bit lines BL&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb;, &lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; and &lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; are set to 0 V, respectively. By doing so, when charge is not stored in the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell), the current Ids flows, and therefore, for example, a current of 25 &mgr;A or greater flows in the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb; on the opposite side through the transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that are in ON state. In contrast, when charge is stored in the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell), the current Ids does not flow. Therefore, even when the transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are in ON state, current that flows in the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb; on the opposite side is, for example, smaller than 10 nA. Accordingly, by detecting current that flows in the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb; on the opposite side by the sense amplifier, data can be read from the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell) of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the bit lines BL&lsqb;i&rsqb; and &lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; are connected to the bit line selection transistor (n-type MOS transistor) <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A, and the bit lines BL&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb; and &lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; are connected to the bit line selection transistor <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It is difficult to secure a high current drivability for the selection transistors <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B due to their size; they have, for example, a channel width W&equals;0.9 &mgr;m and a channel length L&equals;0.8 &mgr;m in the present embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Since the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb; to be connected to the sense amplifier needs to secure the above-mentionedcurrent, the gate voltage of the bit line selection transistor <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A is supplied through a step-up circuit (not shown) such that, for example, a voltage of 4.5 V is supplied to the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the voltage on the source side of the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A on the selected side becomes a voltage close to 0 V (about several tens to one hundred mV). As a result, there is little influence on the back gate of the bit line selection transistor <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B, and therefore its gate voltage is set to Vdd. This gate does not have to be supplied with 4.5 V, and therefore the load to the above-described step-up circuit (charge pump) can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the voltages shown in Table 1 are set for the unselected cells in the selected block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Next, voltages according to Table 2 shown above are set for the opposite block (small block <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>) in the sector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is opposite to the selected block in the sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the state of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the voltage of each of the word lines WL and the gate voltage of the bit line selection transistor are commonly used by the sectors <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and therefore have the same settings as in the selected block shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. All of the bit lines are set at 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Voltages according to Table 2 shown above are set for the unselected blocks (small blocks <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>) that are present in the sectors <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> other than the selected block and the opposite block, the state of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the unselected blocks, the gate voltage of the bit line selection transistors <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B, the word lines WL, and the control gate lines CG are all set at 0 V. Since the bit line selection transistors <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B are turned OFF, the bit lines BL are in a floating state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an illustration to be used to describe data programming for the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell) on the right side of the word gate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb;) that is connected to the word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows voltages set in the selected block. Before the data programming operation, a data erasing operation to be described below is conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> potential on the sub-control gate line SCG &lsqb;i&rsqb; is an over-ride potential (for example, 2.5 V), which is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and potentials on the sub-control gate lines SCG&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb; and &lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; are at 0 V. It is noted that the &ldquo;over-ride potential&rdquo; is a potential that is required to turn on the transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A so that a program current flows without regard to the presence or the absence of programming of the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A (element on the opposite side of the selected side element) on the left side of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb;. Also, a potential on each of the word gates <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is set by the word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a programming word line selection voltage of, for example, about 1.0 V that is lower than the power supply voltage Vdd. Also, a potential on the control gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (selected cell) on the right side of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; is set through the sub-control gate line SCG&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; at a writing voltage Vwrite (for example, 5.5 V) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which is a programming control gate voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Next, setting of voltages on the bit line BL is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> schematically shows the interior of a Y path circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that is connected to the bit line BL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A first transistor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> for connecting the bit line BL to a sense amplifier or a bit line driver, and a second transistor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> for connecting the bit line BL to a path other than the above are provided in the Y path circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Opposite signals YS<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and /YS<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> are input to the gates of the first and second transistors <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A power supply voltage Vdd (1.8 V) and a constant current source <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> that provides a constant current of, for example, 5 &mgr;A are provided for the source of the second transistor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> through a switch <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Upon programming, the voltage VD&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; on the bit line BL&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is connected to the bit line driver through the transistor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, such that it is set at a programming bit line voltage, for example, at 5 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Also, the bit line BL&lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; is set at Vdd through the transistor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the switch <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Both of the bit lines BL&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb; and &lsqb;i&rsqb; are connected to the constant current source <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> through the second transistor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the switch <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. However, the MONOS cell that is connected to the bit line BL&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb;, with its control gate line CG&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb; being at 0 V, and therefore being in an OFF state in which current does not flow, is set to 0 V through the constant current source <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As a result, the transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&rsqb; turn on, such that the current Ids flows toward the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb;, and on the other hand, channel hot electrons (CHE) are trapped in the ONO film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> of the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B. In this manner, a programming operation for the MONOS memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B is conducted, with the result that data &ldquo;0&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo; is written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In an alternative method, instead of about 1 V, the programming word line selection voltage may be set to about 0.77 V, to set the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb; to 0 V. In the present embodiment, although the programming word line selection voltage is raised to about 1 V to increase the source-drain current, the current that may flow in the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb; during programming is restricted by the constant current source <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. As a result, the voltage on the bit line BL&lsqb;i&rsqb;, can be optimally set (in a range of 0 to 1 V, and at about 0.7 V in the present embodiment), and the programming operation can be optimally performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As a result of the operation described above, a voltage of 5.5 V is also applied to the control gate of the non-volatile memory element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A on the right side of the unselected twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb;. At this moment, since the control gate CG&lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; on the right side of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; is at 0 V, current does not intrinsically flow between the source and the drain of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; (between the bit lines). However, since a voltage of 5 V is applied to the bit line BL&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb;, a punch-through current flows and write-desturbance occurs when a high electric field is applied between the source and the drain (between the bit lines) of the twin memory cell <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb;. Accordingly, the voltage on the bit line BL&lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; is set to, for example, vdd, instead of 0 V, to thereby reduce the potential difference between the source and the drain to prevent write-disturbance. Also, the voltage on the bit line BL&lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; may be set to a voltage exceeding 0 V, and may preferably be set equal to or greater than the word line selection voltage during programming. As a result, the transistor T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the memory cell &lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb; becomes difficult to turn on, such that disturbance is also prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Also, because a voltage of 5 V needs to be supplied to the bit line BL&lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb;, a voltage of 8 V is applied to the gate of the bit line selection transistor <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B. In the mean time, a voltage of 8 V is likewise applied to the gate of the bit line selection transistor <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B. Because the bit line BL&lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; is required to be set to Vdd for the reasons described above, and therefore a high voltage higher than Vdd also needs to be applied to the gate of the transistor <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A, a voltage of 8 V that is the same as the gate voltage of the transistor <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B is used. It is noted that a gate voltage of the bit line selection transistor <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A higher than Vdd&plus;Vth may suffice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It is noted that voltages according to Table 1 are set for the unselected cells in the selected block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Next, voltages according to Table 2 shown above are set for the opposite block (small block <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>) in the sector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> opposite to the selected block in the sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the state of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the voltage of each of the word lines WL and the gate voltage of the bit line selection transistor are commonly used by the sectors <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and therefore have the same settings as in the selected block shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. All of the bit lines are set to 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Voltages according to Table 2 shown above are set for the unselected blocks (small blocks <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>) that are present in the sectors <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> other than the selected block and the opposite block, the state of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

Since the bit line selection transistors <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B are turned OFF, the bit lines BL are in a floating state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> schematically shows an illustration used to describe erasing data in all the memory cells in the sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> in one lot, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows the state of set voltages for memory cells in a part of the sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the potential of each of the word gates <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is set to 0 V by the word line WL, and the potential of the control gates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>B is set at an erasing control gate line voltage that is, for example, about &minus;1 to &minus;3 V by the sub-control gate lines SCG&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb;, &lsqb;i&rsqb;, &lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb;, and &lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb;. Furthermore, a potential of each of the bit lines BL&lsqb;i&minus;1&rsqb;, &lsqb;i&rsqb;, &lsqb;i&plus;1&rsqb;, and &lsqb;i&plus;2&rsqb; is set to an erasing bit line voltage that is, for example, 4.5 V to 5 V by the bit line selection transistors <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B, and the bit line driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As a result, electrons trapped in the ONO film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> of each of the MONOS memory elements <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B are extracted by the tunnel effect and erased by the erasing control gate voltage applied to the control gates and the erasing bit line voltage applied to the bit lines By this, data at the plurality of twin memory cells can be simultaneously erased. It is noted that, according to another erasing operation different from the one described above, hot-holes may be formed in the band-band tunneling at the surface of the impurity layer that defines bits to thereby erase the stored electrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Also, without being limited to the one in which data in the sector is erased in one lot, data can be erased in a time division manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Next, voltages according to Table 2 shown above are set for the opposite block (small block <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>) in the sector <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is opposite to the selected block in the sector <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the state of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the voltage of each of the word lines WL and the gate voltage of the bit line selection transistor are commonly used by the sectors <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and therefore have the same settings as in the selected block shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. All of the bit lines are set to 0 V. In each of the cells in the opposite block, both of the control gate lines CG and the bit lines BL are at 0 V, and therefore disturbance does not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Voltages according to Table 2 shown above are set for the unselected blocks (small blocks <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>) that are present in the sectors <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> other than the selected block and the opposite block, the state of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In the unselected blocks, the gate voltage of the bit line selection transistors <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B, the word lines WL, and the control gate lines CG are all set to 0 V. Since the bit line selection transistors <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>B are turned OFF, the bit lines BL are in a floating state. However, since the voltage on the bit lines BL is a voltage that is very close to almost 0 V, disturb does not occur in the cells in the unselected blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, and many modifications can be made within the scope of the subject matter of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> For example, the structure of the non-volatile memory elements <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B is not limited to the MONOS structure. The present invention can also be applied to a non-volatile semiconductor memory device using other types of twin memory cells in which charges can be trapped independently at two locations, using one word gate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and first and second control gates <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Also, in the embodiment described above, one example is described with respect to the number of divisions of sector regions, the number of divisions of large blocks and small blocks, and the number of memory cells in each small memory block, and many type of modifications can be made. It is noted that the number of divisions for the large blocks is eight due to the restrictions imposed on the metal wiring pitch. If the metal wiring pitch can be made smaller, the number of divisions can be further increased. For example, when it is divided into sixteen blocks, the loadcapacitor (gate capacitor) of each one of the control gate lines is further reduced, and a higher driving speed can be achieved. However, it is noted that when it is divided into sixteen blocks, the number of main control gate lines increases. Accordingly, the lines and spaces have to be narrowed or the area has to be increased. Also, the number of control gate drivers increases, and the area is accordingly Increased. </paragraph>
