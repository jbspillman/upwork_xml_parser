<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to a method for the removal of surface coatings from various surfaces. In particular, this invention pertains to a method of using ultra-high pressure water to remove surface coatings, including paint, to expose the metal hulls of ships. A remotely controlled platform having a ferro-magnetic and motive means moves the ultra-high pressure nozzles about the surface to be treated. An alternate embodiment of the invention incorporates a recycling and waste disposal system whereby the water is recovered, the coating particulate removed and the water reused as an abrasive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The marine environment is extremely demanding on coatings applied to hulls, or other bodies, which are submerged for long periods of time. The corrosive properties of salt water are well known, and in this hostile environment even the most durable coating must be replaced periodically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The degree of surface roughness of submerged portions of ships has a great effect on both ship fuel efficiency and the speed which can be achieved at a given propeller revolution rate. Roughness can be caused by marine growth (&ldquo;fouling&rdquo;), degradation of hull coatings, and deterioration of unpainted surfaces such as propeller blades. For commercial, private or military ships, losses in ship performance can have a variety of consequences, both financial and in terms of meeting scheduled arrival dates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although the following examples are for a VLCC Very Large Crude Carrier; an oil tanker, with the following typical approximate specification: 272,000 tons deadweight; total engine horsepower (at 90 RPM propeller rate): 32,700 hp, examples could be given for any size or type of marine craft. A typical trip for a VLCC is from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. This round trip normally takes about 40 days. However, with an increased surface roughness causing a loss in peak speed of only 1 knot (nautical mile per hour), 2&frac12; days would be added to the trip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Considering the effect of surface roughness on efficiency, for a VLCC, each increase of 1 RPM in propeller rotation rate corresponds to an increase in ship speed of about 0.15 knot. Thus, a roughness caused loss of one knot would require an increase of about 6.7 RPM to maintain the same-ship-speed (i.e., to overcome the increased ship resistance). This increased propeller speed requires 20 tons (metric ton) per day of extra fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Marine engineers estimate that an increase in the average roughness of a ship&apos;s hull of about 30 microns (peak-to-peak, RMS roughness) can cause a drop in peak achievable speed of about one percent. A new hull can have a surface roughness of about 160 micron and a deteriorating coating can be about 280 micron. This roughness increase could cause a four percent drop, which for a typical 16 knot VLCC peak speed is a loss of about 0.64 knots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The foregoing clearly demonstrates the economic importance of maintaining the submerged surfaces of ships in as smooth a condition as is practical. Therefore providing a means to maintain surface smoothness of ships is a practical and economical objective for ship owners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Fouling of ship bottoms not only reduces fuel efficiency, thus increasing operating costs, but also attacks the integrity of the coating which leads to corrosion and metal fatigue. Corrosion damage to hulls can lead to costly repairs, loss of operating time and, if unchecked, to the premature scrapping of the vessel. Environmental laws hamper fouling prevention by limiting the types of paint which may be used, especially those containing organotin/tributylin and cuprous oxides which are most effective in controlling calcerous fouling. Thus, because the most effective preventive measures against fouling are unavailable it has become necessary to replace coatings more frequently. The coatings which can be applied under current laws need a superior surface finish in order to extend the life of the coating on the surface. Astute ship owners realize a superior surface finish extends the life of the coatings and reduces drydock time and expenses in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There are presently three existing cleaning methods which are used for cleaning ship&apos;s hulls; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> 1. Chemical paint strippers are currently used to remove small patches on the holes required for non-destructive testing and access cuts. This method is unsuitable for cleaning the entire ship&apos;s hull and it creates large amounts of toxic waste for each area cleared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> 2. Abrasive grit blasting is used for cleaning the entire hull. Current hull cleaning methods using abrasive grit generate tons of abrasive that must be detoxified if used on the organic paint, and millions of gallons of water that must be treated annually. Satisfactory methods have not been developed to manage the organic waste during the application of the paint, removal of spent paints in dry-dock prior to repainting, and detoxification of the grit and other wastes generated during the present abrasive blasting method used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> 3. High Pressure Water Jet Systems, using pressures of less than 10,000 psi, usually in a manual nozzle. The prior art water nozzles lacked sufficient pressure, typically less than 10,000 PSI, to completely remove paint from the surface of a hull. Another major disadvantage of prior art rotary water jets is the slow rate at which multiple layers, or very hard coatings, can be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To fully remove coatings from hulls it is necessary to construct platforms for operators from wooden bars or rods, or by suspending-gondolas or cradles or the like from above, when blasting. Thus, the operators must work by hand on such platforms located at a considerable height. For this reason, the operation is dangerous and, in addition to this, the efficiency of removal is extremely low. To overcome this disadvantage, various steered vehicles have been proposed. However, such vehicles heretofore proposed have proved to be unsatisfactory, for example, in that when the vehicle is driven over a surface having a certain curvature instead of a flat plane of a structural member, it is not possible to obtain a sufficient adhesion force for supporting its weight and further that it tended to sometimes damage the operation surface due to the contact pressure exerted between the vehicle and the operation surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Some vehicles use permanent magnet means and/or electromagnet means mounted thereon, and are driven by magnetic belts provided on both sides of the vehicle. Changing the direction of travel of a vehicle of this type requires remarkable skill as the apparatus has the tendency of slipping at the contact area either of the right or left belts during the turn of the vehicle owing to the change in the contact pressure between the vehicle and the wall surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Some examples of the prior art are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Hirosha et al U.S. Pat. No. 3,777,834 discloses a magnet vehicle supportedly adhered to and adapted to run over an inclined wall surface of a structural member made of a strong magnetic material such as iron and steel, characterized in that the vehicle can be altered of its direction of travel as desired on the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Woods U.S. Pat. No. 3,922,991 discloses an apparatus for cleaning relatively large, flat, ferro-metallic surfaces of corrosion, scale, paint and undesirable marine growths, the apparatus having high pressure fluid blasting assembly, magnetic attachment device, driving motor, and a signal generating and receiving system for guiding the apparatus along the surface to be cleaned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Cadutt U.S. Pat. No. 4,890,567 discloses a robotically operated device using an ultrasonic transducer for the cleaning of ships&apos; hulls. The device may also be used for spraying paints or other chemicals on the sides of ships&apos; hulls. The device includes a housing having an open face adapted to confront a ship&apos;s hull and apparatus disposed in the housing for impinging a flow of fluid through the open face onto the ship&apos;s hull. An ultrasonic transducer is disposed in the housing for impinging a flow of ultrasonic energy through the open face onto the ship&apos;s hull. Apparatus connected to the outside of the housing retains the housing on the ship&apos;s hull and moves the housing on the ship&apos;s hull. In an additional embodiment, apparatus for spraying paint or other chemicals on a ship&apos;s hull is disposed in the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Andosen U.S. Pat. No. 4,926,775 discloses a cleaning apparatus for use under water, particularly for cleaning vertical surfaces which are fouled by marine organisms. One or more nozzles for spraying water at high pressure at a surface to be cleaned are arranged on a rotary disc-shaped unit where the rotation axis is intended to be generally perpendicular to the surface which is to be cleaned. The nozzles are obliquely located in a circular plane so that the rotating unit can rotate. Beyond the periphery of the rotating unit there is a casing which forms an annular chamber with an outlet which is at least partly directed away from the surface which is to be cleaned. The annular chamber is formed from two generally cylindrical or truncated conical casing units which are positioned at a radial distance from each other with their internal ends concentric with respect to the nozzle holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Rabuse U.S. Pat. No. 4,690,097 discloses an aquatic scrubbing device for attachment to an underwater ferro-magnetic surface incorporates a carriage, at least two independently energizable electromagnets supported by the carriage for rotation about mutually parallel axes, and at least one drive motor for rotating the electromagnets relative to the carriage, whereby alternative energization of the electromagnets and the drive motors will cause a walking motion of the carriage when attached to the ferro-magnetic surface, the device incorporating rotatable scrubbers for removing aquatic growths from that surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Lever et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,048,445 discloses providing a fluid jet system for underwater maintenance of a ship hull. The fluid jet system includes an open frame cart having a high pressure fluid nozzle manifold for cleaning and smoothing the submerged hull of the ship. One or more thruster assemblies are provided on the cart for deploying the cart through the water, advancing the cart along the hull and maintaining the cart in contact with the hull. Control of the thruster assembly and fluid flow manifold can be effected from either longitudinal end of the cart. Flexible fluid flow lines interconnect the cart to one or more remote sources of pressurized fluid so that the cart is independently operable. A system for deploying the cart is further provided and includes, the necessary high pressure pumps, devices for hose deployment and retrieval, and diver supplies. Finally, a system of underwater maintenance of ship performance is provided whereby the condition of the hull of the ship is monitored and areas to be cleaned and smoothed are determined in order of priority based upon projected improvement to ship performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Hirana U.S. Pat. No. 4,697,536 provides for vessels and the like which require cleaning either periodically or whenever a need arises to remove various living things such as seaweeds and shells or contaminants such as oil for the sake of appearance and proper performance. Divers were conventionally employed to manually remove them one by one using a scraper as one means to remove such substances. Such manual operation is, however, extremely inefficient, involving great amounts of time and labor especially for large ships. The main body of a cleaning apparatus is pressed against an underwater object to be cleaned by means of impellers which are provided substantially at the center of the main body and driven to rotate, whereby cleaning brushes which are provided at the bottom of the cleaning apparatus concentrically with the impellers are rotated to remove substances adherent to the object while the cleaning apparatus is manipulated to run on the object&apos;s surface. Two pairs of an impeller and a brush are provided in parallel at the normal angle to the direction of forward and backward movement of the cleaning apparatus. The impellers and the brushes are driven by the same driving source as they are connected to the impellers by means of a universal joint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Urakami U.S. Pat. No. 4,809,383 discloses a device capable of adhering to a wall surface by suction by the pressure of an ambient fluid and treating the wall surface, which comprises a pressure receiver member and a partition defining a pressure reduction zone in cooperation with the pressure receiver member and the wall surface. In one aspect, the partition has a sealing function of preventing inflow of a large amount of an outside fluid into the pressure reduction zone, and a treating function of treating the wall surface by being moved in a required manner. In another aspect, the partition has the above sealing function, and a travelling function of moving the device, by being rotated about an axis of rotation slightly inclined to an axis which is substantially perpendicular to the wall surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Okita et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,574,772 discloses an underwater cleaning apparatus having a carrier, a plurality of wheels for shifting the position of the carrier along a submerged surface, a plurality of rotary brushes carried by the carrier and adapted to clean the submerged surface, and a source of power for rotating the rotary brushes. The apparatus further comprises flexible partition wall members for transmitting torque to the rotary brushes and forming reduced pressure chambers communicated with spaces formed by bristles of respective rotary brushes. As the rotary brushes rotate, the rotary brushes and the partition wall members in combination serve to provide vacuum to produce a force to press the carrier through the wheels onto the submerged surface to be cleaned. In addition, each of the rotary brushes are allowed to individually follow the configuration of the surface thanks to the flexibility of the partition wall members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In view of the substantial cost and time savings afforded by maintaining the submerged surfaces of ships in as smooth a condition as possible and by avoiding frequent dry docking and in view of the problems with previous systems for ship hull paint removal, it is an object of the invention to provide a system and method for removing coatings from the metal substrate of a hull. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present inventive subject matter relates to removing surface coatings from a hull of a vessel and more particularly to removing the surface coating all the way to the bare metal surface, also referred to as the &ldquo;white metal&rdquo;. The process basically involves the use of water at very high pressures which when directed to the hull strips away all surface coating layers. A remotely controlled platform having a ferro-magnetic and motive means moves the ultra-high pressure nozzles about the surface to be treated. As used herein the term &ldquo;surface coating&rdquo; refers to all materials that are adhered to the white metal and include without limitation, paint, salt, minerals, rust, dirt, plant and animal growth matter such as algae and barnacles, welding material and materials used to patch the surface of the hulls to prevent water leaks, and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a steered magnet vehicle which can alter its direction of travel with high reliability, ease, and in a considerably restricted area. The magnetic vehicle which can be supported on a structural member by the adhesion force only of a permanent magnet means. This invention also enables the use of a ultra-high pressure water jet system and method for removing coatings, paint, deposits, organic and inorganic from hulls without harming the substrate material and to provide a superior surface for the application of subsequent coatings. This invention improves on standard water jet technology, which uses direct impingement of the water to loosen and remove the coating by directing complimentary streams of water whereby the surface is cleaned not only by the blast effect of the water but also by the tangential water forces of the concentric circles which is more efficient than removing coatings only by direct impingement. Additionally, the present invention reduces the amount of waste product that is environmentally hazardous. Water is the sole abrasive and as such it can be filtered, the hazardous particulate removed, and then recycled and returned to be reused as a stripper or disposed of without polluting the environment. Thus, hull stripping, which previously produced tons of contaminated abrasive and required expensive hauling of the contaminate to an approved landfill for disposal, now only produces a few fifty-five gallon drums of stripped paint which is more readily disposed of. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Further, it has been found that not only is there no noticeable damage to the hull surface, but the cleaning operation itself is accomplished very efficiently, and the hull surface is virtually free of contaminants. Traditional methods of stripping paint from the hull of a ship often times scored the metal substrate, leaving peaks and valleys on the surface of the metal. Coats of paint subsequently applied to the metal adhered to the peaks, leaving gaps between the paint and the substrate which weaken the adhesive strength of the coating. The present invention does not score the surface of the metal, thus allowing uniform adhesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The present invention also removes contaminants, especially chlorides and sulfides, preventing the future encroachment of rust on the cleaned area which also improves the adhesion characteristics of paint coatings subsequently applied to the stripped metal. Traditional abrasive blasting leaves surface steel with chloride levels higher than the present process. Furthermore, traditional abrasive blasting produces chloride levels of 20 micrograms per cubic centimeter, as compared to less than 10 and preferably less than 5 micrograms per cubic centimeter with the present process. It is recognized that there is a direct correlation between coatings failures and high salt levels. The more salt remaining on a prepared surface, the lower the adhesion levels, and the shorter the life of the coating. The present process removes 75% more salt and surface contaminants than traditional abrasive blasting and significantly extends the life of the coating. As such, the present process is: (1) less expensive than traditional abrasive blasting; (2) faster than traditional abrasive blasting; (3) produces a far superior surface than traditional abrasive blasting; and (4) significantly extends the life of coatings and reduces drydock time. </paragraph>

A motorized, steerable, magnetically tractive platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> supports the ultra-high pressure water nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and moves it about the surface to be treated. Umbilical cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> provides power and ultra-high pressure water and vacuum suction to platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from support structure <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is and exterior elevational view of motorized, steerable, magnetically tractive platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Umbilical cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> attaches platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by means of rotatable and flexible connector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Connector <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> freely moves so that umbilical cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will hang vertically from the platform to the floor of drydock <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thus allowing for unimpeded passage of high pressure water and power up to platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and return of the water after use with particulate matter. Umbilical cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> carries the ultra high pressure water, vacuum, electrical utility and pneumatic lines. Cowling <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a lightweight shell, made of fiberglass, which covers platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Skirt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached to the base of cowling <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is made of any flexible material, such rubber, nylon, silicone resins and plastics which will provide a generally watertight seal between skirt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the ship hull. The purpose of skirt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to capture any excess water not suctioned by the vacuum system described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cutaway view of platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> wherein nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown. Umbilical cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for carrying ultra-high pressure water to nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. After the ultra-high pressure water has impinged on ship <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the water, and any particulate suspended therein, are collected via suction line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for recycling. Electrical power enters via cable <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. If pneumatic power is required to operate platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> a pneumatic cable is added to umbilical cable <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> without cowling <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and skirt <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is made of lightweight aluminum or stainless steel, having a load bearing capacity of about two hundred pounds. Nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is inserted into aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in cross-beam <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> drives wheels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which are steered by steering units <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The steering unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may receive signals via control wires or via radio control signals from a remote unit. A preferred embodiment of wheels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are 4&frac14;&Prime; by 2&frac12;&Prime; three pole neodymium-iron-boron having a holding power in excess of two thousand pounds. Motor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> should provide sufficient power to move a combined vehicle weight of two hundred pounds and overcome the static inertia of the magnetic tractive force of wheels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A preferred embodiment uses a 24V DC permanent magnet electric motor producing 4000 RPM, an integrated gearbox having gearing to the output shaft of motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of spiral bevel gear to reduce the RPM by a factor of 40 to 1, and turn a wormgear drive, producing sufficient torque to overcome the magnetic tractive force. Universal joints, not shown, connect the drive shaft to the gearbox to allow for flexibility and contact between the drive shaft and gearing during motion of the device over the hull. Methods which can be used to drive platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> need not be limited to that described above. Pneumatic or hydraulic motors are also alternate sources of power, and wheels <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be directly driven from one motor for each pair, one motor for multiple pairs of wheels, or one motor for all wheels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a cutaway view of ultra-high pressure water nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> consists of outer sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the inner wall of which and exterior of the rotating section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> defining a generally conical chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for suctioning and collecting the water after impingement, including any coating particles removed and suspended in the water. At the distal end of the outer sheath <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a water seal <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> consisting of synthetic or natural fibers, rubber, silicon resins or any other suitable material to retain the high pressure water after impingement, until removal by suction. Rotating section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> contains orifices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, connected to high pressure water input line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The central axis of each individual orifice <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is oblique to central axis of nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. By selecting the lateral displacement of orifice <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, in combination with the orifice oblique angle, the individual annular streams of pressurized water can be converged at a focal point to remove paint from the surface through direct and transverse force vectors. By carefully controlling the angles at which orifices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are positioned, and the rotational forces resulting therefrom, it is possible to utilize ultra-high water pressure to effectively clean the working surface being treated. Because the forward thrust of the water suffers some efficiency loss through the nozzle the greater the pressure supplied to the nozzle input, the greater the thrust of the water streams on the working surface. The force of the water leaving the orifices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> causes rotating section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to spin about bearings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. An alternate embodiment uses compressed air or an electric motor to spin nozzle rotating section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The water jet is directed at ship <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at sufficient pressure until the surface coating, including paint, is totally removed and bare &ldquo;white metal&rdquo; remains. The water jet should be at a pressure which is greater than 30,000 psi and it has been found that a preferred practical range is between 35,000 and 60,000, psi even though still higher pressure may also be used with caution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> For the procedures described herein, the diameter of the rotating nozzle section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably in the range of about eight inches to sixteen inches with a preferred diameter of twelve inches. The distance between the orifice opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the nozzle rotating section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the surface of the substrate to be cleaned is preferably such that the water velocity at impact is sufficient to remove at least a majority of the coating material within the water stream impact pattern provided by a single pass of one nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. To accomplish this result, the discharge velocity at the orifice opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is preferably sufficient to provide a water velocity at least about 1,500 ft/sec. Higher impact velocities may be desirable and may be achieved by increasing the water pressure, for example up to about 60,000 psi, and by sizing the orifice bore to provide a higher discharge velocity, for example up to about 3,000 ft/sec. By achieving these velocities, it is possible to clean the surface of a ship hull at a rate of about 150 to about 400 ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>/hour, and preferably from about 200 to 300 ft<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/hour. A plurality of nozzles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> arranged to discharge a plurality of water jets to increase coverage of the area to be stripped. The water flow utilized can be as low as about five gallons per minute and as high as fifty gallons per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is one example of orifice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> configuration. Nozzles configured with orifices with the greatest oblique angle farthest from the centerline of the nozzle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> have constantly diverging streams of water. This configuration provides the maximum coverage per sweep of the nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> but may not provide sufficient cutting action for very deep or hard coatings. Nozzles with the orifices <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> having the lesser oblique angles farthest from centerline <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will have water streams that converge before diverging. This configuration will provide the maximum cutting action, however over a smaller area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts the preferred embodiment which includes a recycling system for the water and waste disposal. The recycling system may be integrated into the drydock <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> structure or inserted in a water-tight container <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> for use on site to avoid degradation problems associated with atmospheric salt water deposits. The water is pressurized by pumping means <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which may be any conventional high compression pump capable of achieving the water pressure desired. Important characteristics of the high pressure water pump <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> include its capacity and horsepower, which are closely related to the flow rate and pressure at which water is ejected through the nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Rotating nozzle section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in conjunction with a ultra-high pressure pump <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> will provide sufficient pressure to remove the paint while minimizing the reactive thrust of the water leaving the nozzle opening to a backward motion pressure of from about 20 to about 100 PSI. Such low backward pressures enable lower tractive forces to hold platform <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the hull <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Without being limited to a particular ultra high pressure pump system, it should be recognized any commercially available positive displacement, pump, such as a plunger pump may be used herein. An exemplary plunger pump would be one that is rated 5.5 gpm (20.82 Ipm) at 30,000 psi (2,075 bar) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Particulate blasted from the ship hull during cleaning are vacuum removed by lines <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and suction created by the intake of pump <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The output pressure of pump <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> sends the water and particulate to filter means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to remove the particles from the water. Filtering means <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be any standard design capable of handling large volumes of liquid containing suspended particles. The particles of paint are collected, in waste storage tank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, for further processing and handling. The water is transferred by pump <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to holding Hank <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to be used again as a stripper agent. Additional water may be added to holding tank <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> via water inlet <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as required. The particulate matter is removed from waste storage tank <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> via hopper <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for proper hazardous waste disposal. When needed during cleaning, the water is removed from holding tank <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and passed by pump <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be applied to the hull surface to be treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The above combination of a movable tractive platform and ultra-high pressure water jet coating removal results in a superior cleaning rate which is less labor intensive, and a &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; surface to apply the next coating to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> While the above description has been directed towards a method to remove paint from the surface of the hull of a waterborne vessel, it is within the scope of the present invention to remove paint from other surfaces such as rolling stock, automobiles, trucks, aircraft, storage tanks, or other structures that would benefit from ultra-high water pressure cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention and all such modifications are intended to be included within he scope of the following claims. </paragraph>
