The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> further includes a front wheel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> mounted on the front fork <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted on the rear fork <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may further include a braking apparatus. The braking apparatus may include a brake actuator handle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided adjacent to each of the hand grips <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, brake lines <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and front and rear brake calipers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The braking apparatus is configured so that one of the brake actuator handles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> operates the front brake caliper <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the other of the brake actuator handles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> operates the rear brake caliper <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may further include a kickstand <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention further includes a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to propel the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Although the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in the drawings on the right side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be provided on the left side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in a mirror image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the drawings. The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment includes a support shaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, an axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> provided on the support shaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a crank or pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mounted on the axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and a pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a device of positive retention, such as, for example, a pin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so that the pedal is freely rotatable. The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> further includes a large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> mounted on the axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and a smaller sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> mounted on the axle of the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the smaller sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are drivingly connected by an endless driving device that engages the teeth of the sprockets <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The present invention may include any suitable type of endless driving device such as a chain or belt, and in the present embodiment includes an endless chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. A ratcheting mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is provided on the hub of the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fixed with respect to the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> so that the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> turns with the pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, rotation of the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> turns the endless chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which turns the smaller sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a ratcheting mechanism may be provided at the front of the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, adjacent the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown more particularly in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may further include a crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> surrounding the axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is mounted on the crank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with jam nuts <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may include gussets <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending therefrom and to the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>). Inside the crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, there is provided a torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; including a coiled portion having a center through which the axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> passes. The torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; includes a housing end <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a crank end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The housing end <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; is received in a hole <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The crank end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; is received between spring restraining elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Also provided in the crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are caged ball bearings <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, adjustable bearing races <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and bearing seats <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As shown most particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may further include a support shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a support plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (support shaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is hidden behind support shaft <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>). The torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; returns the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the up position from the down position, setting the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the start position for the next down stroke. This action further ensures that the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> follows or stays in contact with the bottom of the operator&apos;s foot during the up stroke of the pedal. A spring adjustment device may be included to allow for tension adjustment throughout the life of the spring to compensate for spring weakening or friction changes that may occur between drive system components over time, and to adjust the return speed of the pedal to a rate that is comfortable to the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the crank end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; may be mounted in a hole (not shown) in the axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, rather than between spring retaining elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The hole may be, for example, &frac14;&Prime; deep. Such a hole may facilitate crank disassembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the pedal return spring system may be eliminated to reduce unnecessary weight (such as in a racing environment), and a system comprised of a Velcro&trade; (book and loop fastener) strap attachment may be included to secure the pedal to the operator&apos;s foot. The strap holds the operator&apos;s foot on the pedal, so that the operator supplies the force to return the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the start position by lifting the pedaling foot. A female snap may be applied to the bottom of the pedal and a male snap may be fastened to a side of the pedal, and may be of the type to break away during a fall or when the operator wants to stop and dismount. Simply rolling the foot on the outboard side of the foot supplies the force to disconnect the snaps and allow the operator to use the drive foot to dismount when stopping. Further, pulling the drive leg and foot to the top of the stroke would also supply enough force to separate the foot from the pedal when the stroke stop components make contact. This system has a reduced number of components, and reduced weight and production cost for the system. Further, the snap system may be located at the farthest, most advantageous point from the pivot point of the pedal crank system, requiring less force to return the pedal to the top of the power stroke. In this system, muscle power is used to overcome gravity and friction to return the pedal to the top of the power stroke, instead of springs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As shown particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may further include a stationary stop <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> provided on the outside of the crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a front stop <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> mounted on the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a rear stop <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> mounted on the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The interaction of the stationary stop <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> with the front and rear stops <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> prevents the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from going through a complete revolution. Thereby, the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and pedal crank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> produce reciprocating rotation of the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The front and rear stops <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> may be placed so that the device is capable of a 90&deg;-100&deg; arc of stroke, or the front and rear stops <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> may be placed so that the device is capable of up to a 220&deg; arc of stroke. Thus, the pedal crank mechanism is similar to the type found on a bicycle, but differs in that a bicycle pedal crank mechanism utilizes a 360&deg; stroke, while the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the present invention utilizes a stroke of less than 360&deg;. The stop system determines the top and bottom of the stroke and prevents the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; from exceeding its travel limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> During operation of the above described embodiment of the occupant propelled vehicle, the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> oscillate between the front and rear stops, driving the chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, small sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to propel the vehicle forward. To begin riding, an operator may mount the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by stepping on the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with one foot (the right foot in this embodiment) and pushing the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the lower position, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. Then the operator may push off the road surface with the other foot (the left foot in this embodiment) to start movement of the vehicle. Once the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is moving forward and balanced upright, the rider may place the left foot on the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to support himself. Once supported and balanced on the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> with the left foot, the operator may lift his right foot, and the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will be returned to the upper position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) by the force of the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;. When the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> reaches the upper position, the operator pushes downwardly with his right foot, moving the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> downwardly, and the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> turns therewith in a clockwise direction, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. This downward movement of the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is the power stroke that drives the chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, smaller sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and propels the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> forward. The pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> continues moving downwardly until such movement is stopped by contact of the rear stop <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> with the stationary stop <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> have moved approximately 90&deg;-100&deg;, or up to 220&deg;. This position is shown most particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. The downward movement of the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the turning of the crank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> work against the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, tightening the spring and storing potential energy. When the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has reached its lower limit position as determined by the rear stop <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, the rider releases the force on the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and allows his foot to rise. With this release of force, the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; is also released, along with the stored potential energy. The torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; returns to its unstressed position and turns the axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and crank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the counterclockwise direction and moves the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> upwardly to its starting position, to the point where the front stop <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> contacts the stationary stop <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and stops any further movement of the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This position is most particularly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. The sprockets <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are permitted to move in the counterclockwise direction (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) without driving the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> backward due to the ratcheting sprocket <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This action, of reciprocating the pedal <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, is repeated to propel to the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a forward direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an operator may begin riding the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by placing the left foot on the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and pushing off with the right foot until the operator and vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are moving and balanced. Then, the operator may place the right foot on the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (which is in the upper position due to the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;) and push down therewith to drive the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and propel the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> forward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may include a stirrup or strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The stirrup or strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be attached at its ends to the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, providing a space for an operator&apos;s foot. The stirrup or strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>holds the operator&apos;s foot on the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> during the upstroke. The stirrup or strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be provided in addition to the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; and stops <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, or, alternatively, may be provided instead of the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;, or the stops <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, or both the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; and the stops <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be provided with a Velcro&trade; fastener to hold an operator&apos;s shoe directly on the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A system including a stirrup or strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will be advantageous in racing applications or stunt competition, due to the lower weight obtainable by eliminating the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; and/or the stops <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be attached to the crank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from either end of the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the stirrup or strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will be properly positioned to receive an operator&apos;s foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> An operator also may coast along without propelling himself, such as, for example, to get started, to slow down, or to rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may further include a safety guard, to protect the rider from the moving sprockets <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and to protect the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. The second embodiment of the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> includes an axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, crank or pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as in the first embodiment. However, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> includes arcuate toothed gears rather than a sprocket and chain drive of the first embodiment. The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> includes an arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having its center at the axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is mounted on the axle <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to be rotatable therewith with the reciprocation of the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the crank or pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> further includes an idler or intermediate gear <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and a driven single direction ratcheting gear <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> mounted on the hub of the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be mounted on a support shaft <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or mounting plate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>), that is secured to the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment may further include a crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; as in the first embodiment to return the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to its starting position. Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference>, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> includes a stationary stop <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> mounted on the crank housing <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a front stop <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> mounted on the arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a rear stop <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> mounted on the arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the second embodiment, the front and rear stops <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> prevent the arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from over rotating, and only allow the gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to rotate through its toothed arc section. This arc may be determined for optimum performance; the stops may be positioned for an arc of 90&deg;-100&deg;, or the stops may be positioned for an arc up to 220&deg;. The second embodiment, including the arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the intermediate gear <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the driven gear <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, provides a vehicle having increased power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment is operated in a manner similar to that of a vehicle having a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as in the first embodiment. An operator may begin by stepping on the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and pushing the pedal downwardly to the lower position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The operator then pushes off with the other foot to start moving. Once the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is moving and balanced, the operator steps on the platform <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Then, the operator may begin the pumping action of the pedal to oscillate the drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, drive the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and propel the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> forward. The downward movement of the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> turns the arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which turns the idler gear <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and ratcheting gear <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, thereby driving the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is pushed until it reaches the lower position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 9</cross-reference>B), where the arcuate toothed gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is stopped by the stop <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. In this position, the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; is stressed. The operator then releases his foot and the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> rises due to the potential energy stored in the torsion spring <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime;. The pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> rises until it reaches the upper position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>A) and the arcuate toothed gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is stopped by the front stop <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The ratcheting gear <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> allows the arcuate toothed gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to turn counter clockwise and move from the lowest to the highest position without driving the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> backwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the present invention may include gears other than circular gears to optimize or increase performance, such as for example, noncircular, elliptical or eccentric gears. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The particular stroke path experienced by the pedal and the operator&apos;s foot in the several embodiments, described above and hereinafter, varies depending on the configuration of the drive system. The power stroke will vary up to a potential stroke of 220&deg;, depending on the leverage factor (i.e., the length of the pedal lever determines the leverage available to the operator). For example, the gear ratio may be 3:1 with a low leverage factor. In such an example, the drive gear pivot point is located in close proximity to the operator&apos;s position, and the leverage factor is low due to the short distance between the pedal and the center of the drive gear. This component arrangement has a potential total stroke of 220&deg;. During the power stroke, the pedal and the operator&apos;s foot move forward as they move downward until just past the horizontal centerline of the drive gear, at which point they move rearward as they continue downward. This forward and rearward movement is much more pronounced in this component configuration than would be found in the configuration having a significantly higher leverage factor (i.e., with the pedal located a greater distance from the pivot point of the drive gear). For example, an arc of the pedal at a distance of 30 inches from the drive gear pivot point will be substantially longer than the pedal arc on a drive gear having a radius of 12 inches or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may include a quick change system for the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, it is possible to quickly and easily attach the pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on either the left or right side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This feature allows the operator to choose between left and right side operation, a feature similar to that found in some fishing reels, for example. This embodiment includes a pedal crank shaft <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This pedal crank shaft <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be in the form of a flat shaft cross section and fits into a like-shaped hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the crank housing <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> includes such a hole <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in both ends thereof. When the device is configured for right foot pedaling, the crank shaft <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends from the right side of the crank housing <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (the right side of the figure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). When the device is configured for left foot pedaling, the crank shaft <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> extend from the left side of the crank housing <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (the left side of the figure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). The crank shaft <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is fixed and secured to the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> with a shoulder <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, flat washer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and linch pin <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The crank shaft <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be secured to either side of the crank housing <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> with these elements in this fashion. The device may further include a spacer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for the configuration of left foot pedaling to prevent interference with the crank housing <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a device of positive retention, such as, for example, a pin <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so that the pedal is freely rotatable. The mounting of the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is an important safety related detail. Since the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be mounted on either the left or right side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the direction that the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> spins during the stroke may change over the life of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and neither a left hand nor a right hand threaded member could keep the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> securely mounted on both sides of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a mounting device that is not effected by the spin direction of the pedal is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the drive mechanism may include a long pedal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for use by either foot interchangeably. In this embodiment, the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes an elongated platform <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Such an elongated platform <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may support both of an operator&apos;s feet, one in front of the other. Further, in this embodiment, the pedal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be elongated so that the rider may reach backward and operate the pedal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with either foot. The pedal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may, for example, be extended an amount equal to three pedal crank arm lengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment may be modified to include a large sprocket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The large sprocket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> drives a small sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via a chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The large sprocket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has a greater diameter than the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and is positioned on the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> substantially on the same vertical centerline as the small sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (i.e., rearwardly of the position of the large sprocket <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment). This embodiment also includes a longer pedal lever <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> than the pedal lever <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. The size and position of the large sprocket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is possible due to the additional leverage from the longer pedal lever <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The actual gear ratios and leverage which are possible and optimum on the vehicle of the present invention will vary depending on the application, such as whether the vehicle will be operated by a child or an adult. Small children and adults will have different available input forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference> includes a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> modified to include a large sprocket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and pedal lever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The large sprocket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> drives a small sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via a chain <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The large sprocket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a larger diameter than the large sprocket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>, and is positioned on the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rearwardly of the vertical centerline of the small sprocket <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (i.e., rearwardly of the position of the large sprocket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>). This embodiment also includes a pedal lever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> that is longer than the pedal lever <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>. The size and position of the large sprocket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is possible due to the additional leverage from the longer pedal lever <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>) may be modified to include an arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> drives a driven ratcheting gear <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the rear wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via an idler or intermediate gear <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a greater radius than the arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> and is positioned on the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rearwardly of the position of the arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the second embodiment.

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> includes a modification of the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and includes an arcuate toothed drive gear <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a pedal lever <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> with an angled portion. The angled portion of the pedal lever <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> provides a more comfortable pedal position for the operator, and allows a full range of motion while preventing the pedal from contacting the road surface.

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The drive system of the present invention has a unique way of capturing and transferring energy for the purpose of moving a wheeled vehicle and is especially efficient when adapted to a stand-on rolling platform, such as a scooter. This drive system also provides a high degree of comfort to the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The following occurs during the power (downward) cycle of the stroke. On start up, the power is applied over the longest range of the stroke. As the vehicle gains speed, the range of available power gains of the stroke decreases proportionally. The top of the power stroke is used as an area of acceleration until it catches the power gain portion of the stroke. Eventually a point is reached whereby only a change in gear ratio can increase the potential for more power and speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> There are several alternative configurations that can be applied to this drive system that allow it to become a multi-speed drive system, such as a system that relies on a simple leverage adjustment (not shown in the drawings) which can be accomplished easily during operation. This system only requires one gear ratio yet it performs as a multi gear ratio system, and may be applied in the chain and sprocket embodiments or the sector gear embodiments. As an example of such a system, a relatively high gear ratio is used, such as a 5:1 gear ratio. On start up, the drive gear and idler assembly is shifted to a point farthest from the operator, at the rearmost point of the system. The driven gear remains in one position relative to all other parts; and the drive gear and idler assembly may be shifted on a radius that follows the center of the driven gear. At the rearmost position, the increased leverage of the extended pedal crank compensates for the high gear ratio on startup. After startup and during operation, the drive gear and idler assembly are moved closer to the operator. As the distance from the center of the drive gear (which is the pivot point) to the pedal gets shorter, the distance the drive gear travels increases, taking advantage of the higher gear ratio to increase speed. The portion of the pedal crank arm between the drive sprocket and the pedal is telescopic to allow for the leverage adjustment while maintaining the same location of the pedal relative to the operator and platform section of the vehicle. The drive system of this embodiment provides a substantial increase in power and speed over the sprocket and chain system. The vehicle may be made in several sizes, including a faster version for teens and adults that is larger overall than a children&apos;s version. This shifting of the leverage point has the effect of increasing the length of stroke while the actual leverage factor is decreasing. The momentum of the vehicle as velocity increases allows the leverage factor to be decreased, causing the drive gear and driven gear to travel a farther rotary distance per stroke. As an example, a 6:1 gear ratio may be provided with the following components: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Drive gear: 9&Prime; radius gear, or 18&Prime; diameter spur gear segment, 220&deg; stroke arc; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Idler gear: 3&Prime; diameter; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Driven gear: 3&Prime; diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The drive gear and idler gear may be affixed to a mounting plate which has its own pivot point. This assembly is free to be moved or shifted around the radius of the driven gear, maintaining a parallel relationship to the driven gear radius in all positions. On start up, the assembly consisting of the drive gear, idler gear, and mounting plate is in the rearmost position. In this example, there is 24&Prime; from the pedal crank pivot point (the center of the drive gear) to the centerline of the pedal, located at the opposite end of the pedal crank arm. Due to the distance from the pedal to the pivot point of the drive gear, there is a large amount of leverage, which allows the operator to accelerate the vehicle despite the high gear ratio. The pedal travel relative to the rotary distance being traveled per stroke of the drive gear is low. Once velocity has increased to a point where the effective power gain per stroke has diminished significantly, it is time to shift. Instead of shifting gears, the leverage factor is shifted. This shifting can be accomplished by means of one or more levers, one or more cables, or a combination of the two. By shifting it is meant that the pivot point of the drive gear is moved closer to the pedal where input power is being transmitted to the system. The center of the drive gear will travel upwardly as it is moved forwardly, cresting at the half way point between maximum forward and maximum rearward positions since the drive gear follows the radius of the driven gear as it is moved about the drive assembly pivot point of the mounting plate. Once the drive gear passes the half way point it descends vertically until it reaches the forward most position. With the pivot point of the drive gear at the forward most position, with a theoretical overall leverage factor 10&Prime; (the distance between the centerline of the pedal and the drive gear pivot point or center) leverage is decreased and rotary distance traveled by the drive gear (per stroke) has increased, effectively providing a means to increase the velocity of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Another multi-speed version (not shown in the drawings) may include a small gearbox and a final drive system of sprockets and a chain or belt. The gearbox may have gear ratio settings of 1:1 or 3:1. A sprocket attached to the output shaft of the gearbox and a one-way or ratcheting driven sprocket attached to the rear wheel hub have a 3:1 gear ratio. This provides a final gear ratio of 3:1 when the gearbox is in the 1:1 gear ratio setting and a final gear ratio of 6:1 when the gearbox is in the 3:1 gear ratio setting. The gear ratio of the final drive portion of this type of system is the lowest gear ratio that can be achieved. Any higher gear ratio that is desired may easily be achieved within the gearbox mechanism, in any combination of incremental increases. The gearboxes that can be utilized to provide multi-speed capability can be relatively small and lightweight given the fact that the components will be subjected to relatively low maximum forces. Additionally, a gearbox or gearboxes (one on each side of the vehicle) may be located anywhere on the rear of the vehicle, including at the rearmost portion of the vehicle, preventing interference with operator comfort or safety by presenting clearance or space problems. Further, positioning the gearbox rearwardly provides a pedal crank lever leverage increase. A gearbox embodiment may also be used with a quick change pedal system or a two pedal system, as described above; (i.e., input power can be transmitted from either side using the quick change pedal or two pedal system). A gearbox may also be used for supporting a drink cooler, a basket, or custom racks, such as, for example, for a fishing pole or a surfboard. Such items may be secured to the top or sides of the gearbox. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> A planetary style multi-speed gearbox may easily be adapted to a final drive of a sprocket and chain system as well. An all gear drive system may be configured in a long thin space that would hug the side of the rear tire on one or both sides, keeping the overall vehicle width to a minimum.

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the vehicle may include two pedals, to allow operation by either the left or right foot. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes a modified platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a left pedal <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and a right pedal <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The modified platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a T shape to allow passage of the pedals beyond the plane of the modified platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and to allow for safe and comfortable pedaling during operation. Such passage of the pedals beyond the modified platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> maximizes the power available, and makes up for some power that may be lost at the top or beginning of the power stroke. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes drive mechanisms (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> as described above) that are mirror images of each other; and the pedal lever length is dependent upon the location of the arcuate toothed drive gear or large sprocket (i.e., in the several embodiments as described above). The left side drive mechanism may be secured to the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a left hand thread cap screw <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and the right side drive mechanism may be secured to the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a right hand thread cap screw <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The modified platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> further includes a pad <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> constructed of, for example, rubber. This embodiment may further include extensions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> from the pedal levers. At the bottom of the down, or power, stroke of the pedal lever, the extension <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> strikes the pad <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, which acts as a stop for the pedal lever <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to define the bottom of the stroke. The extension may be any of several shapes which define the bottom of the power stroke above, at, or below the plane of the platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a large rear tire or wheel <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> that is larger than the front wheel. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of this embodiment with the large rear wheel <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> may be used for riding on rough terrain, such as grass, rocks, and weeds, and for going uphill. The large rear wheel <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> may include a knobby tire for increased traction, and may be, for example, 20 inches in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the present invention, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the torsion spring system for pedal return may be replaced by a coil spring system <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for pedal return, mounted on the side of the sprockets or gears opposite to the pedal. In this embodiment, the extension spring stores the potential energy that returns the pedal to the top of the power stroke. The coil spring pedal return system <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> includes an extension spring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, a tensioner provided at one end of the extension spring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and a mounting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provided at the other end of the extension spring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The present invention may include any suitable type of tensioner, and in the present embodiment includes a wire rope <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The tensioner may also be of other types known in the art, such as &ldquo;Bungee&rdquo; cord type tensioner. The wire rope <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is received in a wire rope channel <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> having a belled entrance, and the wire rope channel <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is mounted on a peripheral area of the drive sprocket or drive sector gear of the above described embodiments. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the mounting device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes an eyebolt provided at an end of the extension spring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, a pivot and pivot housing, a spring tension adjustment nut, and a jam lock nut, all mounted on the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown more particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the pivot and pivot housing may be mounted on the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through a hole in the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with flat washers, a frame bushing, and a cotter key or hairpin clip. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the coil spring pedal return system <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is mounted on the drive gear or drive sprocket and the frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to return the pedal <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the up position. The tension in the extension spring <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> may be adjusted by the spring tension adjustment nut. The tension adjustment nut allows for tension adjustment throughout the life of the spring to compensate for spring weakening or friction changes that may occur between drive system components over time. Further, the coil spring pedal return system <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is easy to replace and service, and the coil spring pedal return system <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be mounted on any of the three gears in the sector gear system (i.e., the coil spring need not be mounted on the drive gear), or to more than one of the gears or sprockets. This provides for a multitude of options available pertaining to the location of the pedal return system components. In the sector gear embodiments, the wire rope component of the system may be attached to the hub portion of the gear. This hub portion should be relatively small in diameter to allow for as short a maximum spring deflection as is reasonably achievable. A pivoting component through which the spring tensioning eyebolt passes is advantageous in an embodiment including a segment gear in the high ratio/high leverage configuration comprises the drive system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>. The wire rope component need not include a pivoting member, but may simply be securely fastened to a stationary frame member since the point at which the wire rope contacts the hub remains substantially constant (due to the short radius from the center of the gear to the wire rope fixing location) relative to the point where the other end of the spring is affixed to the stationary member. Further, a similar system, using a compression spring, may be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27, a</cross-reference> farther embodiment of the present invention includes an alternative drive gear segment configuration. The drive system of this embodiment provides a vehicle weight reduction as well as lower component quantity requirements, and resulting lower production costs. In this embodiment, the idler gear and related components are eliminated. This drive system of this embodiment includes an internal tooth gear segment rather than an external tooth gear segment, shown in the prior embodiments. In this embodiment, the pedal crank arm telescopes to maintain a very slight arc of the stroke. A simple linkage consisting of one rod and two tie rod ends attached to the pedal crank arm and a rigid frame member may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may include plastic or fiber gears, tubular or lightweight frame members and low-friction bearings; and some or all of the components may be formed of any suitable synthetic or natural plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may farther include more than two wheels. The vehicle may include three wheels, with, for example, two wheels in the rear and one wheel in the front. Alternatively, the vehicle may include four wheels, with two wheels in the rear and two wheels in the front. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may further include additional components, which may be added or removed as desired by the operator to provide more features and amenities. For example, the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may include a seat or saddle for the operator, to rest after pedaling and coast, or to sit on while pedaling. Alternatively, a seat or saddle may be used by a passenger, while the operator is supported by the platform. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may include a child&apos;s safety seat, or a basket in the front or in the rear of the vehicle, to carry articles, such as, for example, purchases. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may further include components that make the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> more visible during the day and night, and safety features, such as lights. The vehicle may further include a custom locking system, to lock the vehicle at school, work, or a shopping center. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may further include a storage area, or an insulated cooler, such as, for example, of the soft or hard type that holds one or more drinks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may further include a speedometer, such as, for example, a wind gauge speedometer. A speedometer would be simple in construction, low cost, and would not compromise the safety of the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention has many uses and may be configured in many styles. For example, the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be used as a recreational vehicle, or a serious transportation vehicle. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be configured as an all terrain vehicle, with larger wheels and lower gear ratios to allow for off road traveling and hill climbing, such as for cross country skiing in the summer, and to be able to climb steep grades. The vehicle may be configured for use on the beach or in the desert, with tires designed for that purpose. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may include variable combinations of wheel size, gear ratio, and leverage (of the pedal arm) to provide a variety of performance options; and may include multiple gears. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be provided in a multiple passenger model; and may include a hand pump to operate the gear and sprocket or sector gear drive system. Additionally, belts and pulleys utilized as drive train components are a possibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The vehicle of the present invention will be useful in traffic on busy streets during rush hour, and is more pedestrian-friendly than a bicycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention includes many advantages, including exposing the operator to less risk of injury than the push type scooters, and is more comfortable, especially during continuous riding over distances, than the push type scooters. The vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is quieter, less expensive and less dangerous than a gas or electric model. Further, some localities have prohibited the use of gas or electric powered scooters in certain areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be configured of a suitable tubular material, such as, for example, metal.
