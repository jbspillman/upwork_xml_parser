<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A computer telephony speech system capable of detecting crash and being reset automatically includes a computer telephone speech server unit, and a detecting unit connected to the computer telephony speech server unit. When answering a call, the computer telephony speech server unit issues an active message for being sent to an internal reset module and to the detecting unit via a communication link. If the detecting unit receives no active message in a first predefined time period, a reset message is sent to the reset module for performing a reset operation. If the reset module does not receive any active message or reset message in a second predefined time period, a reset operation is performed automatically. The second predefined time period is larger than the first predefined time period. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a computer telephony speech system, and, more particularly, to computer telephony speech system capable of detecting crash and being reset automatically and its method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Currently, with the wide spread use of telephony systems, it is very popular to access information through a telephone. Therefore, many computer telephony speech systems are developed, for example, the auto telephone exchange system, weather inquiry system, hospital registering system and traffic inquiry system. Most of the systems provide multi-channel services. When more and more services are required by the users, the functions of the systems become more and more complex, and thus the loads of the systems are increased. Accordingly, the possibility in that the system becomes abnormal and is crashed is increased. Therefore, in order to provide a whole day service, the high reliability and high availability are required and become a major concern in designing a system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are many reasons that may cause the system to crash, which can be classified as a hardware problem and a software problem. In the hardware problem, other than the computer hardware, the telephone interface for providing speech functions may also cause the system to crash. However, in general, such a problem can only be dealt with by the hardware manufacturer, instead of the designer of the computer telephony speech system. For example, some telephony card manufacturers provide a hot-swapped telephony card. In a system with such a telephony card, if the telephony card is out of order, one can simply pull out the bad telephony card and insert a new card. The driver program will be automatically loaded into the system and be activated. As to the software problem, two kinds of problem can be classified. One is the problem in the computer telephony speech system, which is generally resulted from the improper process of the multi-threaded program. The other one is resulted from the error of the driver program of the telephony card. In general, this problem can not be solved by the system designer, and has to be reported to the hardware manufacturer. Therefore, the crash problem is inevitably existed in the computer telephony speech system due to the hardware and software problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, when a crash-like problem is occurred in a telephony speech system, the system is manually and continuously detected whether the system is actually crashed. If it is detected that the system is indeed crashed, the system is restarted manually. Such a conventional method can not meet the actual requirement because tremendous labor and time are required. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,065,053 granted to Nouri, et al. for &ldquo;A system for resetting a server&rdquo;, a local area network or RS-232 interface is used to reset the computer system in the near end, and a modem is used to reset the computer system in the far end via a telephone network, thereby achieving the object of resetting a computer system. With such an arrangement, the system manager has to determine whether the system should be restarted through a far end or near end screen, and the modem is used only for connecting a far-end device to the system without providing a reset function. Therefore, it is unable to resolve the crash problem of the computer telephony speech system. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a novel system and method to mitigate and/or obviate the aforementioned problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the system structure of the computer telephony speech system capable of detecting crash and being reset automatically in accordance with the present invention, which includes a computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and a detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be a computer device, or the likes, for providing the computer telephony speech service. The computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for providing telephone speech service, a telephone speech interface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for answering the calls from a telephone network <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, a reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a first communication interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The telephone speech interface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is installed with a driver program <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for being called and executed by the computer telephony speech system. The first communication interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is, for example, a network card or an RS232 interface for sending the status of the computer telephony speech system to the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through a communication link <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is used to reset the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> when the computer telephony speech system is crashed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be implemented by a computer device, which includes a detecting module <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> for detecting whether the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has been crashed, a dial interface <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> capable of dialing and connecting to the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through a telephone network <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, and a second communication interface <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, such as a network card or an RS232 interface, which is corresponding to the first communication interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for receiving the status of the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and transferring, when a crash is detected, a reset signal to the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through the communication link <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a display screen of a computer device implementing the detecting unit, which shows the status of the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, such as the channel status, so that the user can be aware of the operation condition of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With the above computer telephony speech system, it is able to realize the function of detecting a crash and automatically resetting the system. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is realized as an auto telephone exchange system for describing the operation flow of the method of the present invention. The auto telephone exchange system can answer a call from the user and then switch the call to other extension lines according to the name pronounced by the user. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, after the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is started and the system is in normal condition, the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is waiting for a call for providing an auto telephone exchange service (step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>). If a call is made by a user and the telephone speech interface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> correctly answers the call (step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>), the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is driven to issue an active message. This active message is sent to the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in the same computer device (step S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>), and is also sent to the remote detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the communication link <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> by the first communication interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). Then, the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is able to provide service to the user (step S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). When the user hands off the telephone (step S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>), the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to wait for a call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned active message is transferred in a form of data frame, which has a format as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Each data frame has the fields of message length and message content. The content is stored with a form of &lcub;KEY, VALUE&rcub;. For example, in the active messages, &lsquo;:call_in&rsquo; is a KEY, and its VALUE is the channel number in the telephone speech interface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 1</cross-reference>, after starting the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a first timer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is driven for counting to a first predefined time period (step S<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>). The detecting module <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is waiting for a message, i.e., the active message issued by step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, from the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>). If the detecting module <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> receives the active message through the second communication interface <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> before the first timer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> has reached the first predefined time period, the detecting module <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is aware of the active status of each channel of the auto telephone exchange system and that the auto telephone exchange system is now in a normal condition, and thus resetting the first timer (step S<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>). Meanwhile, the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may perform a statistic analysis on the utilization of the auto telephone exchange system. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the analysis result is displayed on a screen by a curve, so that the system manager can conveniently know the condition of the auto telephone exchange system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, if the timer <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> has reached the first predefined time period but the detecting module <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> does not receive any active message, it indicates that the operation of the auto telephone exchange may be abnormal so that the auto telephone exchange can not receive incoming calls, and thus no active message can be transferred to the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. At this moment, the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can directly transfer a reset message to the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for performing a reset operation. However, in order to assure that the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is indeed crashed, the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> automatically dials and connects to the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through the dial interface <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for testing the condition of the system (step S<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>). If the auto telephone exchange system can answer the call, the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> issues an active message to the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as in the normal condition. After the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives this active message, it can determine that the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in normal condition, and thus the first timer is reset to zero (step S<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>). Generally, this condition occurs when the auto telephone exchange system is not very busy, for example, in holiday. On the contrary, if the auto telephone exchange system can not answer the call, the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> knows that the auto telephone exchange system is crashed. Therefore, the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> issues a reset message to the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via the communication link (step S<highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>). The format of the reset message is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The content of the message is also stored with the form of &lcub;KEY, VALUE&rcub;. For example, a message having a KEY of &lsquo;:reset&rsquo; and a VALUE of &lsquo;noanswer&rsquo; represents that the reason for resetting is that the auto telephone exchange system can not answer a phone call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When receiving a reset message, the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> calls the operating system to directly terminate the execution of the operation system or restart the auto telephone exchange system. However, in order to avoid a condition that the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can not transfer the reset message to the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> due to the breakdown of the communication link <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, when transferring the active message, the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also transfers the active message to the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, whereby the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can determine whether it is necessary to perform a self-reset. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, after the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is started, a second timer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is driven for counting to a second predefined time period (step S<highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>). The reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is waiting for a reset message from the detecting unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> or an active message from the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>). If the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> receives the active message from the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> while no reset message is received and before the second timer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reaches the second predefined time period, it can be determined that the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in normal condition, and thus the second timer is reset to zero (step <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>). Since the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the computer telephony speech module <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are located at the same computer device, it is impossible to fail in receiving the active message due to the problem of the communication link <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, if a reset message is received, or the second timer has reached the second predefined time period while no reset message is received, it can be determined that the computer telephony speech server unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has been crashed. Possibly, the auto telephone exchange system is crashed due to the problem in the auto telephone exchange system itself or in a driver program. Therefore, the reset operation of the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can be divided into two parts. The first part is to close the driver program <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the auto telephone exchange system and the telephone speech interface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The second part is to restart the driver program <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the auto telephony exchange system. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the reset module <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> first sends a stop command to terminate the auto telephone exchange system (step S<highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>). Then, the driver program <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the telephone speech interface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is stopped (step S<highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>). Next, the driver program <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the telephone speech interface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is restarted (step S<highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>). Then, the auto telephone exchange system is restated (step S<highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>), whereby the auto telephone exchange system is recovered to the normal condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In view of foregoing, it is known that the present invention is able to detect a crash by using the existed features of the computer telephony speech system. That is, if the computer telephony speech server unit is in normal condition, i.e., capable of answering a call and providing services, the system is known to be in an active status. Therefore, it is only necessary to transfer this active message to the detecting unit, and the detecting unit can know the operation condition of the computer telephony speech server unit. Besides, if no active message from the computer telephony speech server unit is received in the first predefined time period counted by the first timer, the detecting unit will automatically detects whether the computer telephony speech server unit is able to correctly answer a phone call by using a dial-in test through the dial interface, so as to determine whether it is necessary to restart the system. Therefore, it can be assured that the computer telephony speech server unit is restarted only when the system is actually crashed. In addition, if there is no active message or reset message received within the second predefined time period counted by the second timer, the computer telephony speech server unit can start a reset operation by itself. Therefore, it is able to avoid the condition that the detecting unit can not reset the system due to the breakdown of the external communication link. The first predefined time period must be smaller than the second predefined time period. Typically, the first predefined time period is very short, for example, five minutes. Therefore, when the system is crashed and if the communication link is not broken, the system will be reset automatically after five minutes. The second predefined time period is relatively large, for example 12 hours, for preventing the system from being erroneously reset. Therefore, when the system is crashed and the communication link is broken, the system can be reset automatically after 12 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed. </paragraph>
