<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a low-cost lithium ion secondary battery with high safety during overcharge, to a separator employed therein, to a battery pack and to electric/electronic devices provided with the lithium ion secondary battery, and to a charging method for the lithium ion secondary battery. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> With the recent popularity and increasing performance of portable electronic devices there has been a commensurate demand for secondary batteries with high energy density. This demand has been met by greater use of lithium ion secondary batteries which employ a carbon material that can be electrochemically doped and dedoped with lithium as the negative electrode active material and a lithium-containing transition metal oxide as the positive electrode active material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This type of lithium ion secondary battery undergoes charge and discharge by migration of lithium ions between the positive and negative electrodes, by which storage and release of electrical energy are accomplished. The lithium ion secondary battery has a high energy density, because it outputs an average voltage of approximately 3.7 V which is about 3 times that of conventional secondary batteries, but, because aqueous electrolyte solutions cannot be used as for conventional secondary batteries, non-aqueous electrolyte solutions with sufficient oxidation-reduction resistance are used. For this reason, lithium ion secondary batteries are often referred to as non-aqueous secondary batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Because non-aqueous secondary batteries use a flammable non-aqueous electrolyte solution as the electrolyte solution, there is a risk of combustion and, therefore, great caution must be taken for safety when they are used. While numerous situations can result in exposure to risk of combustion, overcharging is particularly dangerous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent overcharging, existing non-aqueous secondary batteries are charged with a constant current and constant voltage, and the batteries are provided with a precise protection circuit (safety circuit: IC&plus;FET&times;2). Such protection circuits are costly and thus add to the cost of non-aqueous secondary batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When overcharging is prevented by a protection circuit, the protection circuit sometimes fails to operate properly, and therefore it cannot be considered substantially safe. Existing non-aqueous secondary batteries include modifications such as the provision of a safety vent, PTC element and the use of a separator with a heat fuse function (shut down function) in order to safely destroy the battery in the event of overcharging if the protection circuit breaks during overcharging. However, even when such a means is provided, the safety during overcharging cannot always be reliably guaranteed, depending on the overcharging conditions and, in fact, combustion accidents still occur with non-aqueous secondary batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Since safety measures against overcharging with non-aqueous secondary batteries are therefore still inadequate from the standpoint of safety and cost, a problem to be solved has remained, and various methods have been proposed to improve the problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One approach for improvement is aimed at destroying the battery in a safer manner when the protection circuit fails to function. Examples of this approach include addition of a compound that readily generates a gas upon overcharging and causes rapid actuation of a safety vent, as proposed in Japanese Patent No. 2928779, Japanese Patent No. 3061759, Japanese Patent No. 3113652, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-306610 and elsewhere, addition of a compound that polymerizes upon overcharging, thus blocking the current, as proposed in Japanese Patent No. 3061756, and addition of a compound with an endothermic effect in the event of overcharging, as proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-45740; some of these methods involving additives have been implemented and have improved the safety of non-aqueous secondary batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another approach is aimed at ensuring safety while also achieving cost savings by removal of the protection circuit or simple-protection as with a thermistor system. Examples of this approach include the use of redox shuttle additives, as proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-338347, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-251932, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-277147, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-228215 and elsewhere. Redox shuttle additives cause an oxidation-reduction reaction between the positive and negative electrodes upon overcharging, thus preventing overcharging by a mechanism which consumes the overcharge current. Some such additives have been implemented and have contributed to the improved safety of non-aqueous secondary batteries, but they have not succeeded in removing the protection circuit or simplifying it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 2000-67917 proposes a technique related to preventing overcharging by employing a gel-polymer electrolyte film, and this suggests the possibility of eliminating or simplifying the protection circuit. However, the technique requires a film thickness of no less than 30 &mgr;m for the gel-polymer electrolyte film, with 40 &mgr;m or greater needed to obtain an adequate effect and even greater thicknesses in order to achieve a notable effect. This thickness is not widely used, though, considering that the separator thickness in most existing non-aqueous secondary batteries is 25 &mgr;m, and that the trend is toward a smaller separator thickness as increasingly higher energy density is pursued for batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 2000-123824 also proposes a technique for preventing overcharging that employs a gel-polymer electrolyte, thus suggesting the possibility of eliminating or simplifying the protection circuit. According to this technique, overcharging is prevented by using a polyether oligomer, but the technique is not widely used because of the resulting very poor discharge characteristics of the battery compared to existing non-aqueous secondary batteries. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be explained in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is a battery comprising a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a separator and a non-aqueous electrolyte, wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> 1) the separator is composed essentially of a porous sheet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 2) the positive electrode active material and the negative electrode active material can be reversibly doped and dedoped such that, where Qp (mAh) is an electric charge necessary for causing total lithium contained in the positive electrode to be dedoped and Qn (mAh) is an electric charge necessary for causing lithium to fully dope the negative electrode, Qp&gt;Qn, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 3) when the battery is charged at a charging current IC (mA) in a range of 0.2Qn/h&lt;Ic&lt;2Qn/h, in a range of an electric charge for charging Qc (mAh) of 1&lt;Qc/Qn&lt;Qp/Qn, doping of the positive electrode by lithium is started through lithium particles produced on the negative electrode by charging of the battery and is continued up to Qc&gt;Qp, and it exhibits the characteristics described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Overcharge-Preventing Function&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When charging the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention at a practical charging current Ic such that 0.2Qn/h&lt;Ic&lt;2Qn/h, doping cannot occur at the negative electrode during overcharge, such that the deposited lithium particles reach the vicinity of the positive electrode surface, doping the positive electrode, and this phenomenon continues up to Qc&gt;Qp, thus preventing any further overcharge of the battery. The present inventors discovered that, if lithium particles deposited on the negative electrode surface are allowed to reach the vicinity of the positive electrode surface to a shallow overcharge depth at which the electric charge Qc is such that 1&lt;Qc/Qn&lt;Qp/Qn, then it is not only possible to guarantee the safety of the lithium ion secondary battery during overcharge, but the lithium particles reaching the vicinity of the positive electrode surface are doped at the positive electrode so that complete internal short-circuit does not occur between the positive and negative electrodes, and discharge is possible even after overcharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> This overcharge-preventing function is characterized in that overcharging is prevented by doping of the positive electrode with lithium particles produced on the negative electrode during overcharging, and the safety of the battery is guaranteed during overcharging by continuation of this phenomenon until Qc&gt;Qp; however, in order to guarantee even higher safety of the battery, the phenomenon is preferably continued up to Qc/3 Qn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A lithium ion secondary battery in which this phenomenon occurs with Qc/Qn&lt;1 is a battery that cannot be fully charged, and is therefore not preferred. When the phenomenon does not appear with Qc/Qn&lt;Qp/Qn, the phenomenon cannot occur with Qc/Qn&gt;Qp/Qn, for reasons related to the lithium amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Needless to mention, in order to obtain a lithium ion secondary battery with this overcharge-preventing function, it is necessary for Qp and Qn to be such that Qp&gt;Qn. The overcharge-preventing function of the battery of the invention is achieved by utilizing the lithium particles being deposited at the negative electrode surface during overcharging, but these lithium particles were originally contained in the positive electrode, and since the electric charge amount that can be used at that time is Qp&minus;Qn, the overcharge-preventing function of the invention is impossible, in principle, if Qp&lt;Qn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In consideration of higher safety for the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, it is preferred to use half of the amount of lithium remaining at the positive electrode when the negative electrode has been completely doped with lithium (Qp&minus;Qn), to exhibit the overcharge-preventing function. That is, it is more preferred to exhibit the overcharge-preventing effect with a more shallow charging depth, at which Qc is such that 1&lt;Qc/Qn&lt;0.5(Qp/Qn&plus;1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Here, Qp and Qn may be calculated from the weight of the positive electrode active material and negative electrode active material per unit area. They may also be determined by forming a three-electrode system battery using the positive electrode or negative electrode as the working electrode and lithium metal as the reference electrode and counter electrode, and measuring the charge/discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The following method may be used to confirm this overcharge-preventing function in the battery of the invention. Specifically, the positive electrode and negative electrode are removed from the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, and Qp and Qn are measured by the method described above to confirm the relationship Qp&gt;Qn. Also, the positive electrode, negative electrode and separator are removed from the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, the positive electrode and negative electrode are connected via the separator, and an electrolyte (electrolyte solution) is injected to fabricate evaluation battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It is confirmed that when evaluation battery <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is charged with a charging current Ic satisfying the condition 0.2Qn/h&lt;Ic&lt;2Qn/h, there is observed a battery voltage drop, a battery voltage oscillation or a general halt in battery voltage increase when Qc is in the range of 1&lt;Qc/Qn&lt;Qp/Qn. The electric charge is defined as Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (mAh) upon initiation of battery voltage drop, a battery voltage oscillation or a general halt in battery voltage increase. It is also confirmed that the battery voltage oscillation or the general halt in battery voltage increase, or depending on the case the battery voltage drop, continues up to Qc&gt;Qp. The separator and positive electrode are then removed from the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, and the positive electrode is connected to a negative electrode collector (i.e., Qn&equals;0) via the separator, and an electrolyte (electrolyte solution) is injected to fabricate evaluation battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For charging at a charging current Ic satisfying 0.2Qn/h&lt;IC&lt;2Qn/h, with the negative electrode collector in this evaluation battery <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the negative electrode, the electric charge is defined as Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (mAh) upon initiation of battery voltage drop, battery voltage oscillation or general halt in battery voltage increase. Here, if the relationship Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt;Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (ideally Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;Qn) is true, then the observed battery voltage drop, battery voltage oscillation or general halt in battery voltage increase will depend on the lithium particles produced on the negative electrode which were originally contained in the positive electrode, and the desired overcharge-preventing function can be confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the test described above, when removal of the negative electrode collector is difficult, a copper foil or lithium foil may be used instead of the electrode collector. An electrolyte solution commonly used in lithium ion secondary batteries may be employed as the electrolyte solution for the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the overcharge-preventing function is exhibited in a lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, the electrical energy introduced by the procedure of charging is released out of the system as Joule&apos;s heat. The Joule&apos;s heat is represented by (charging current&times;battery voltage). Thus, if a large charging current is used the effect of Joule&apos;s heat will be dominant, and it will be difficult to accurately evaluate the overcharge-preventing effect. For application in a practical charging current Ic range of 0.2Qn/h&lt;Ic&lt;2Qn/h, a smaller capacity is preferred for the evaluation battery. A button-type (coin-type) battery is preferable for the evaluation batteries described above, but there is no limitation thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned overcharge-preventing function may be explained as follows for the most common type of lithium ion secondary battery employing lithium cobaltate as the positive electrode and a carbon material that can be doped/dedoped with lithium as the negative electrode. This type of lithium ion secondary battery system is usually designed so that Qn is about half of the Qp. That is, 2Qn&equals;Qp. with conventional lithium ion secondary batteries of this type at sizes used for cellular phones, explosion and combustion occur if the charging rate at which all of the lithium is depleted from the positive electrode when charging at 1 C (charging current Ic&equals;Qn/h) exceeds approximately 200% of charging percentage (electric charge Qc&equals;Qp). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In light of this, it is possible to guarantee safety during overcharge by preventing total depletion of the lithium from the positive electrode, i.e. by halting further charging, but the overcharge-preventing function in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is characterized by accomplishing this via the lithium particles deposited on the negative electrode during overcharge. That is, it is necessary to start doping of the positive electrode with lithium particles at a charging percentage of no greater than 200% (Qc&lt;Qp), and more preferably no greater than 150% (Qc&lt;0.5(Qp&plus;Qn)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Overcharging will not be prevented without continued doping of the positive electrode with the lithium particles deposited on the negative electrode. That is, it must be continued at a charging rate of at least 200% (Qc&gt;Qp) and more preferably at least 300% (Qc&gt;3Qn). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The lithium ion secondary battery of the invention having an overcharge-preventing function based on the mechanism described above has the following features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> 1) When the battery is charged at a charging current IC which satisfies 0.2Qn/h&lt;Ic&lt;2Qn/h, Qc at which a drop in battery voltage occurs, an oscillation in battery voltage occurs, or the increase in battery voltage generally halts is in the range of 1&lt;Qc/Qn&lt;Qp/Qn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Here, a drop in battery voltage occurs when the lithium particles produced on the negative electrode are doped on the positive electrode. An oscillation in battery voltage indicates intermittent doping of the lithium particles. The battery voltage drop and oscillation depend on the internal resistance of the battery, being more difficult to observe when the internal resistance of the battery is lower. In such cases, they can sometimes be observed by radically reducing the voltage sampling time. The battery voltage drop and battery voltage oscillation are also very difficult to observe in cases with a very rapid cycle of deposition of the lithium particles on the negative electrode and doping onto the positive electrode. When the turn over cycle is rapid and the internal impedance of the battery is low, an apparent phenomenon of a general halt in battery voltage increase is observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> 2) When the battery is charged at a charging current Ic which satisfies 0.2Qn/h&lt;Ic&lt;2Qn/h, battery voltage oscillation of 10 mV or greater starts and continues to Qc&gt;Qp, when the electric charge Qc is in the range of 1&lt;Qc/Qn&lt;Qp/Qn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Thus, the battery voltage oscillation is proof of repetition of the cycle of deposition of lithium particles on the negative electrode and doping onto the positive electrode, and an adequate overcharge-preventing function is exhibited if this continues up to Qc&lt;Qp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 3) When the battery is charged at a charging current Ic which satisfies 0.2Qn/h&lt;Ic&lt;2Qn/h to Qc such that 2&lt;Qc/Qn&lt;3 and then discharged at a discharging current Id such that 0.1Qn/h&lt;Id&lt;0.5Qn/h, the discharge capacity Qd is in the range of 1&lt;Qd/Qn&lt;Qp/Qn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The lithium ion secondary battery of the invention can be discharged thereafter, since a complete internal short-circuit does not occur. If the overcharge-preventing mechanism is working, then the discharge capacity Qd is in the range of 1&lt;Qd/Qn&lt;Qp/Qn, taking into account the lithium remaining on the negative electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> 4) When charging with a charging current Ic satisfying 0.2Qn/h&lt;Ic&lt;2Qn/h, the battery voltage is no greater than 5.5 V in the total range where the electric charge Qc is such that 1&lt;Qc/Qn&lt;1.5Qp/Qn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Since further charging is prevented in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention by the mechanism described above, the battery voltage never rises to a voltage at which the electrolyte (electrolyte solution) decomposes. This means that when the overcharge-preventing function is working, the voltage never exceeds 5.5 V so long as a positive electrode material is used which is currently in general use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> 5) The relationship between the battery internal impedance R<highlight><subscript>0.5 </subscript></highlight>at 1 kHz when Qc satisfies Qc/Qn&equals;0.5 and the battery internal impedance R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at 1 kHz when Qc&equals;Qp, is 1.5R<highlight><subscript>0.5</subscript></highlight>&gt;R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When the overcharge-preventing function is working, the decomposition which usually accompanies overcharge does not occur, and hence there is no notable increase in the internal impedance of the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> 6) For Qc in the range of Qp&lt;Qc&lt;1.5Qp, the maximum length of the lithium particles produced on the negative electrode by charging of the battery is 100 &mgr;m or smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> This overcharge-preventing function is exhibited because the lithium particles deposited on the negative electrode are rendered fine so that they rapidly reach the vicinity of the positive electrode surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The lithium ion secondary battery of the invention possesses all of the above features 1) to 6) in principle, but when the charging current increases with greater battery capacity, there will be some cases in which not all of the features are exhibited due to the problem of Joule&apos;s heat. Generally speaking, the overcharge-preventing function required for the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention can be confirmed by satisfying one, or more preferably two of the above features 1) to 6). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As an expected result of the overcharge-preventing function, the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention produces no abnormal decomposition of the electrolyte solution during overcharge, but also causes no destruction of the crystal structure of the positive electrode. The absence of abnormal decomposition of the electrolyte solution can be confirmed by a method such as GC-MS. The absence of destruction of the crystal structure of the positive electrode can be confirmed from the peak pattern in x-ray diffraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Electrodes&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For the positive electrode and negative electrode in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention there are used active materials capable of reversible doping and dedoping of lithium, and materials commonly employed in lithium ion secondary batteries may be used without any particular restrictions so long as Qp and Qn satisfy the relationship Qp&gt;Qn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The positive electrode and negative electrode will generally each be composed of an active material, a binder polymer that binds the active material and retains the electrolyte solution, and a collector. A conducting aid may also be added to improve the conductivity of the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A lithium-containing transition metal oxide such as LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiMn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or LiNiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is preferably used as the positive electrode active material in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention. For the negative electrode active material there is preferably used a sintered organic polymer compound such as polyacrylonitrile, phenol resin, phenol-novolac resin or cellulose, sintered coke or pitch, or a carbon material such as artificial graphite or natural graphite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As binder polymers there may be used fluorine resins such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF), PVdF copolymer resins including copolymers of PVdF and hexafluoropropylene (HFP) or perfluoromethyl vinyl ether (PFMV) and tetrafluoroethylene, and polytetrafluoroethylene, fluorine rubber, etc.; hydrocarbon-based polymers such as styrene-butadiene copolymer and styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer; and carboxymethyl cellulose, polyimide resins, and the like, but there is no limitation to these. They may also be used either alone or in combinations of two or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For the collectors, a material with excellent oxidation resistance is used at the positive electrode and a material with excellent reduction resistance is used at the negative electrode. Specifically, aluminum, stainless steel, etc. may be mentioned for the positive electrode collector and copper, nickel, stainless steel, etc. may be mentioned for the negative electrode collector. The shape may be that of a foil or mesh. Particularly, an aluminum foil is preferred for the positive electrode collector and a copper foil is preferred for the negative electrode collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Carbon black (acetylene black) is preferably used as a conducting aid, but there is no limitation thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Regarding the mixing ratio of the active material, binder polymer and conducting aid, a range of 3-30 parts by weight is preferred for the binder polymer and a range of 0-10 parts by weight is preferred for the conducting aid, with respect to 100 parts by weight of the active material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The method of manufacturing the electrode is not particularly restricted, and any publicly known method may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Separator&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Two forms of the separator are preferred for use in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The first form is a sheet (A) with an average film thickness of 10-35 &mgr;m, a basis weight of 6-20 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, a gas permeability (JIS P8117: the time required for 100 cc of air to permeate an area of 1 in<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>at a pressure of 2.3 cmHg) of no longer than 100 seconds, a MacMullin number of 10 or smaller and a MacMullin number&times;average film thickness value of no greater than 200 &mgr;m. This type of sheet has large gaps and, as the assembled battery has numerous throughholes with an approximate ratio (curvature) of 1 between the minimum length between the positive and negative electrodes measured along the throughholes in the separator and the separator film thickness, it is easier for the lithium particles produced on the negative electrode to reach the vicinity of the positive electrode surface during overcharging. This is therefore preferred, in order to exhibit the overcharge-preventing function described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A sheet with an average film thickness of less than 10 &mgr;m and a basis weight of less than 6 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>more readily exhibits the overcharge-preventing function, but it has insufficient strength and is prone to short-circuiting, and is therefore not preferred as the separator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The normalized puncture strength can serve as an indicator in consideration of avoiding short-circuiting. The normalized puncture strength is preferably at least 3 g/&mgr;m, and the effective puncture strength (normalized puncture strength&times;film thickness) is preferably at least 80 g. The normalized puncture strength is the value determined by setting the sheet in a 11.3 mm&phgr; fixed frame, sticking a needle with a 0.5 mm tip radius vertically into the center of the sheet, pushing the needle in at a fixed speed of 50 mm/min, and normalizing the force on the needle when a hole is opened in the sheet based on the average film thickness of the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> With a sheet having an average film thickness of less than 10 &mgr;m and a basis weight of less than 6 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, it is difficult to obtain a sheet satisfying the conditions for the puncture strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Also, a sheet having an average film thickness of greater than 35 &mgr;m, a basis weight of greater than 20 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and a gas permeability (JIS P8117) exceeding 100 seconds is not only disadvantageous in terms of the overcharge-preventing function, but is also not preferred from the standpoint of reduced battery characteristics and reduced energy density accompanying the increased internal impedance. When the battery characteristics are considered, the sheet (A) preferably has a MacMullin number of 10 or smaller and a MacMullin number&times;average film thickness value of no greater than 200 &mgr;m. More preferably, the MacMullin number&times;average film thickness value is no greater than 150 &mgr;m. Here, the MacMullin number is an indicator of the ion conductivity of the battery separator, and it is the ratio of the impedance of the sheet (A) impregnated with the electrolyte solution with respect to the impedance of the electrolyte solution alone. Throughout the present specification, the MacMullin number refers to the value measured at 25&deg; C. When the sheet has an average film thickness of greater than 35 &mgr;m, a basis weight of greater than 20 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and a gas permeability (JIS P8117) exceeding 100 seconds, it is difficult to satisfy the conditions for the MacMullin number and MacMullin number&times;average film thickness value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As a specific examples for the sheet (A) there may be mentioned a sheet having hard protrusions or laser-opened holes in a film with a structure such as a polyolefin fine porous film commonly used for separators in lithium ion secondary batteries, or a sheet formed from fibers such as a nonwoven fabric; however, the sheet (A) is not particularly limited so long as it satisfies the conditions given above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When the sheet (A) is composed of fibers, the average fiber diameter of the fibers composing the sheet is preferably &frac12; to {fraction (1/10)} of the average film thickness of the sheet (A). If the average fiber diameter is less than {fraction (1/10)} of the average film thickness of the sheet (A), the curvature is increased, not only making it impossible to obtain adequate battery characteristics but also posing a disadvantage in terms of the overcharge-preventing function. If the average fiber diameter is greater than &frac12; of the average film thickness of the sheet (A), there is less intertwining between the fibers, making it impossible to obtain a sheet with adequate strength. The mesh of the sheet (A) is also too large, causing short-circuiting problems when the battery is fabricated. When such a sheet (A) is used with the second form of the separator of the invention described below, numerous pinholes are produced and a satisfactory separator cannot be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When the sheet (A) is composed of fibers, it is preferably in the form of a nonwoven fabric. The method of fabricating the nonwoven fabric may be any commonly used dry sheeting method, spun bond method, water needle method, spun lace method, wet sheeting method and melt blow method. The wet sheeting method is particularly preferred among these methods because it can easily give a uniform, thin nonwoven fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The overcharge-preventing function of the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is believed to be closely related to the separator structure (texture), and not particularly related to the material of which the sheet (A) is composed. In other words, the sheet (A) can be suitably used so long as it is made of a material with sufficient oxidation resistance and reduction resistance. Such materials include polyesters, aromatic polyamides, polyphenylene sulfide, polyolefins and the like. These may be used alone or in combinations of two or more. The material composing the sheet (A) need only have a molecular weight sufficient to obtain a molded article, and in most cases a molecular weight (weight average molecular weight: MW) of 5000 or greater is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The second form is a porous film with an average film thickness of 10-35 &mgr;m and a basis weight of 10-25 g/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, which contains a porous organic polymer film (B) that surrounds the above-mentioned sheet (A) and is swellable with the electrolyte solution and is retainable. Although this second form may be slightly inferior to the above-mentioned form in which the separator is composed of the sheet (A) alone in terms of the overcharge-preventing function since it may impede the lithium particles deposited on the negative electrode from reaching the vicinity of the positive electrode surface during overcharge, it is still possible to amply guarantee the safety of the lithium ion secondary battery during overcharge so long as the conditions described above are satisfied. On the other hand, the advantage of the second form over the first form is improved retention of the electrolyte solution and greater short-circuiting resistance, and it is therefore effective for film-cased batteries to meet the demand for strict conditions against solution leakage, or batteries having a structure in which the separator is wrapped flat, such as in square-shaped batteries, in order to meet the demand for strict conditions against short-circuiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> If the average film thickness is less than 10 &mgr;m and the weight is less than 10 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>in this second form, sufficient strength as a separator cannot be achieved, and problems such as short-circuiting can occur. As with the first form, it becomes difficult to achieve the characteristic values including a normalized puncture strength of 3 g/&mgr;m or greater and an effective puncture strength of 80 g or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> An average film thickness of greater than 35 &mgr;m and a basis weight of greater than 25 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is not only disadvantageous for the overcharge-preventing function, but can also lead to reduced battery characteristics. In particular, the low temperature characteristics will sometimes be undesirable. As with the first form, it is difficult to obtain a porous film of this type having a MacMullin number of 10 or smaller and a film thickness&times;MacMullin number value of no greater than 200 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the overcharge-preventing function of the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is essentially independent of the material of which the separator is composed, and therefore the porous organic polymer film (B) need only be a material that can be swelled with the electrolyte solution and retain it, and that has adequate oxidation/reduction-resistance for use in a battery. From this standpoint, suitable materials for the porous organic polymer film (B) include polyvinylidene fluoride (PvdF) copolymers composed primarily of (PvdF). The molecular weight of the PVdF copolymer is preferably in the range of 10,000 to 1 million as the weight average molecular weight (Mw). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A suitable polymerization ratio of the vinylidene fluoride (VdF) in the PVdF copolymer is in the range of 92-98 mole percent as the molar fraction of VdF. If the molar fraction of VdF exceeds 98%, the crystallinity of the polymer is too high, not only making it difficult to form the separator but also undesirably lowering the degree of swelling with the electrolyte solution. If the molar fraction of VdF is less than 92%, the crystallinity of the polymer is too low, and this may undesirably reduce the mechanical properties and heat resistance of the porous film retaining the electrolyte solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As particularly preferred PVdF copolymers there may be mentioned terpolymers composed of VdF, HFP and CTFE. The copolymerization composition of the copolymer is most preferably VdF/HFP(a)/CTFE(b) &lsqb;where (a)&equals;2-8 wt % and (b)&equals;1-6 wt %&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> If the copolymerization ratio of HFP (a) is less than 2 wt %, the degree of swelling with non-aqueous electrolyte solutions tends to undesirably decrease. If it exceeds 8 wt %, the elasticity of the film is reduced making it impossible to adequately retain a large amount of electrolyte solution, while the heat resistance also tends to undesirably decrease when the electrolyte solution is retained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The copolymerization ratio of CTFE (b) is preferably 1-6 wt %. If the CTFE ratio is less than 1 wt % the effect of adding the CTFE is inadequate, and it tends to become difficult to maintain heat resistance and improve the electrolyte solution retention. If it is added at greater than 6 wt %, the degree of swelling with the electrolyte solution tends to be undesirably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> These PVdF copolymers may be used alone, or they may be used as mixtures of two or more different copolymers. If necessary, they may be blended with electrolyte solution-swelling non-fluorine polymers such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or polyethylene oxide (PEO). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The porous film may also contain a porous inorganic filler if necessary, in addition to the sheet (A) and porous organic polymer film (B). By including a porous inorganic filler it is possible to improve the short-circuit resistance of the film without sacrificing ion conductivity. As suitable inorganic fillers there may be mentioned porous particles of silica, alumina or the like with a particle size of 0.1-10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The porous film can be obtained by impregnating and coating the sheet (A) into a solution of the polymer used to form the porous organic polymer film (B), and then removing the solvent. The following methods may be mentioned as specific methods for fabrication of the porous film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> 1. A method in which a polymer used to form the porous organic polymer film (B), a solvent which dissolves it and is compatible with water, and a phase separating agent (gelling agent or pore forming agent) are mixed and dissolved together, the sheet (A) is impregnated and coated with the dope solution, and the resulting film is then immersed in an aqueous coagulation bath to coagulate the polymer used to form the porous organic polymer film (B), and finally washed and dried to obtain a porous film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> 2. A method in which a polymer used to form the porous organic polymer film (B), a volatile solvent which dissolves it and a plasticizing agent are mixed and dissolved together and the sheet (A) is impregnated and coated with the dope solution and then dried to remove the volatile solvent, after which the plasticizing agent is dissolved and then extracted with a volatile solvent that does not dissolve the polymer used to form the porous organic polymer film (B), and drying is carried out to obtain a porous film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> 3. A method in which a polymer used to form the porous organic polymer film (B) is mixed with a plasticizing agent, the mixture is heated to plasticize and melt the polymer used to form the porous organic polymer film (B) and the sheet (A) is impregnated and coated with this dope, after which the film is cooled to hardness, the plasticizer is dissolved and then extracted with a volatile solvent that does not dissolve the polymer used to form the porous organic polymer film (B), and drying is carried out to obtain a porous film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The second form of the separator of the invention is advantageous over the first form in terms of the electrolyte solution impregnation and retention. The electrolyte solution impregnation can be evaluated by the amount of electrolyte solution impregnated. Throughout the present specification, the amount of electrolyte solution impregnation will be represented by the weight percentage of electrolyte solution impregnated with respect to the dry weight of the separator. The retention of the separator for the electrolyte solution can be evaluated by, specifically, centrifuging the separator impregnated with the non-aqueous electrolyte solution with centrifugal force of 1400&times;g (gravitational acceleration) for 20 minutes to remove the weakly retained non-aqueous electrolyte solution. Throughout the present specification, the retention of the electrolyte solution will be represented by the weight percentage of the separator after centrifugation with respect to the separator before centrifugation. The retention of the electrolyte solution is preferably at least 70 wt %, and more preferably at least 80 wt %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Considering the handling property during manufacture of the battery, the separator described above which is used in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention preferably has a proof stress of at least 1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>N/m, and especially at least 3.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>N/m. The proof stress indicates the elastic limit strength and the degree of tensile force at which the film can be handled, with a higher value signifying easier handling and higher productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The proof stress is usually determined by a tensile test. According to the invention, the proof stress was calculated from a stress-strain curve obtained by cutting out a 1 cm&times;3 cm strip from the separator, and performing a tensile test by tension at a pull rate of 20 mm/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The heat deformation temperature of the separator of the invention is preferably 150&deg; C. or higher, and more preferably 170&deg; C. or higher. The heat deformation temperature can be evaluated by thermal mechanical analysis (TMA). The evaluation of the heat deformation temperature by TMA can be determined by cutting a 4 mm wide strip from the separator, placing a 0.01 N load thereon, and determining the heat deformation temperature as the temperature at which at least a 2% change in length (elongation) occurs when the temperature is increased at a rate of 10&deg; C./min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Non-aqueous Electrolyte&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The non-aqueous electrolyte used in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention may be a solution of a lithium salt in a non-aqueous solvent, as is commonly employed for lithium ion secondary batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As specific examples of non-aqueous solvents there may be mentioned propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), butylene carbonate (BC), vinylene carbonate (VC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), methylethyl carbonate (MEC), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), 1,2-diethoxyethane (DEE), &ggr;-butyrolactone (&ggr;-BL), sulfolane and acetonitrile. These non-aqueous solvents may be used alone or in combinations of two or more. Particularly suitable for use are any one or more solvents selected from among PC, EC, &ggr;-BL, DMC, DEC, MEC and DME. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As lithium salts that dissolve in such non-aqueous solvents there may be mentioned lithium perchlorate (LiClO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>), lithium borotetrafluoride (LiBF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), lithium hexafluoroarsenate (LiAsF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>), lithium trifluorosulfonate (CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Li), lithium perfluoromethylsulfonylimide &lsqb;LiN(CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb; and lithium perfluoroethylsulfonylimide &lsqb;LiN(C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;, but there is no limitation to these. These may also be used in combinations of two or more. The concentration of the dissolved lithium salt is preferably in the range of 0.2-2 M (moles/L). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Fabrication of Lithium Ion Secondary Battery&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The method of fabricating the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is not particularly restricted, and any publicly known fabrication method for lithium ion secondary batteries may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Specifically, one common method involves placing the positive electrode and negative electrode, which have been coupled via the separator, in a case and then injecting the electrolyte therein and sealing it. Vacuum injection is preferably used as the method of injecting the electrolyte, but there is no particular limitation thereto. The coupled electrodes may also be impregnated with the electrolyte solution before being placed in the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> For film-cased batteries in which the case is a pack composed of an aluminum-plastic laminated film, the electrodes and separator are preferably integrated by bonding. In this case, the separator is preferably a porous film of the aforementioned second form. Bonding of the separator and electrodes is accomplished mainly by thermo-compression bonding, and this may be carried out in a dry state without the electrolyte or in a wet state containing the electrolyte. When the adhesive strength between the separator and electrode is satisfactory, it is possible to fabricate the battery without a thermo-compression bonding step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Lithium Ion Secondary Battery&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> There are no particular restrictions on the shape of the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, and it may have any shape, such as cylindrical, prismatic, flat or button-shaped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The case may be a steel can, aluminum can or a pack made of an aluminum-plastic laminated film, but there is no limitation to these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> When the aforementioned overcharge-preventing function is exhibited with the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, the procedure of charging causes the introduced electrical energy to be discharged out of the system as Joule&apos;s heat. This Joule&apos;s heat is expressed as (charging current&times;battery voltage). Since the battery voltage is roughly constant while the overcharge-preventing function is exhibited, Ic is the dominant factor for the Joule&apos;s heat. Although it depends on the Ic employed, an increase in the internal battery temperature by the Joule&apos;s heat can expose the battery to danger such as ignition. The shape of the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is therefore selected to result in satisfactory heat release efficiency, depending on the Ic employed. From the standpoint of improving the heat release efficiency, a film-cased battery using an aluminum-plastic laminated pack as the sheath is preferred. There may also be employed a method in which a radiator plate is mounted on the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Generation of gas due to oxidative decomposition of the electrolyte solution is suppressed in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention as a result of the above-mentioned overcharge-preventing function. Strict conditions are required for film-cased batteries in terms of battery swelling, and from this standpoint as well, the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is preferably used in the form of a film-cased battery. Also, although safety vents are commonly mounted in conventional lithium ion secondary batteries, since gas generation during overcharge is suppressed in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, it is possible to sufficiently guarantee safety during overcharge without provision of a safety vent. However, safety will of course be further improved if a safety vent is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Safety during overcharge in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention may not be guaranteed in some cases depending on the charging current Ic employed, because of the problem of Joule&apos;s heat. The overcharge-preventing function of the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is not preferred in principle for high-current (rate) charging. However, even using the publicly known additives proposed for improvement of safety during overcharge is inadequate for guaranteeing safety during overcharge with high-current (rate) charging. Since the overcharge-preventing function of the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is based on a fundamentally different mechanism than the use of publicly known additives, such additives may also be used. The combined use of such publicly known additives can therefore adequately guarantee safety during overcharge even with high-current (rate) charging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Battery Pack&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The battery pack of the invention is provided with at least a lithium ion secondary battery of the invention and a heat-sensitive sensor (thermo-sensor) or heat-sensitive switch (thermistor and/or PTC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, Joule&apos;s heat is generated when the overcharge-preventing function of the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is exhibited. Overcharge can be detected in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention by this heat energy, and therefore provision of a heat-sensitive sensor (thermo-sensor) or heat-sensitive switch (thermistor and/or PTC) in the battery pack is effective from the standpoint of safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Although safety during overcharge can be sufficiently guaranteed with a heat-sensitive sensor (thermo-sensor) or heat-sensitive switch (thermistor and/or PTC) in the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, it may also be equipped with a protection circuit. The safety of the battery is further improved by provision of a protection circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Charging Method&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The charging method of the invention comprises charging the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention by a constant current method, and judging completion of charging by at least one of the following: battery temperature increase, battery voltage drop or battery voltage oscillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is characterized not only by guaranteeing safety during overcharging by the overcharge-preventing function as described above, but also by being capable of discharge thereafter. The start of the overcharge-preventing function can be detected by the start of battery temperature increase due to Joule&apos;s heat, battery voltage drop or battery voltage oscillation. Detection of the overcharge-preventing function means that the battery is fully charged. Thus, constant current charging is possible whereby the completion of charging is judged by battery temperature increase, battery voltage drop or battery voltage oscillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> However, the charging method for the lithium ion secondary battery of the invention is not limited to the aforementioned method, and any commonly employed constant current/constant voltage charging method may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Electric/Electronic Devices&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> According to the invention there are also provided electric/electronic devices equipped with the lithium ion secondary battery or lithium ion secondary battery pack of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The lithium ion secondary battery or lithium ion secondary battery pack of the invention can be suitably used in portable electronic devices such as cellular phones or laptop computers. In particular, employing the charging method described above can greatly shorten the charging time as compared to ordinary constant current/constant voltage charging methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be explained in greater detail by way of examples. </paragraph>
