<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a plug structure, and more particularly to a plug structure used in an equipment such as a water tank, bath tub or other liquid storage tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An early liquid drainage installation (such as the liquid drainage installation of the water tank) is provided with a plug made of rubber for blocking in the water drain hole, thereby preventing the water in the liquid drainage installation from being lost. The rubber plug may prevent the water from being drained. However, the user has to exert a large force to press or remove the plug, thereby causing inconvenience in operation. In addition, the plug is easily lost, thereby causing inconvenience to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A similar plug structure includes a plug connected to a chain which is combined with the water drainage installation. Thus, the plug will not be lost, and the plug may be removed from the water drain hole by pulling the chain to drain water. However, the chain is immersed in the water drainage installation when the plug blocks the water drain hole. Thus, the chain may be pulled unintentionally to drain water. In addition, dirt may remain on the chain, thereby causing the sanitary problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A recent liquid drainage installation includes a plug structure linked by a lever. A push button or handle may be mounted on the water drainage equipment at the position that is not touched easily, to control the plug to block in or remove from the water drain hole, thereby preventing draining water due to an unintentional touch. However, the lever type structure is directly mounted in the water drain hole, and the entire structure is more complicated with an expensive price. In addition, only a professional technician can clean the water drain hole, and a longer treatment period is needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A conventional plug structure of a liquid drainage installation in accordance with the prior art as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having a circumferential portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> inserted with a sealing ring (such as an O-ring) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The combination of the block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the sealing ring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is mounted in the water drain hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed in a horizontal manner, so that the sealing ring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> closely abuts the inner wall face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the water drain hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thereby blocking the water drain hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The block <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be rotated to the position as shown in phantom lines so as to open the water drain hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for draining water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The conventional plug structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has a simple structure without incurring an unintentional touch. However, the sealing ring <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will be worn during a period of time, so that it cannot closely urge the inner wall face <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the water drain hole <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, the water in the water drainage installation will be lost gradually, thereby affecting the sealing effect of the plug. The solving method is to remove and replace the plug. However, it is difficult to remove the plug. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a plug structure, wherein when the sealing ring is worn and cannot entirely stop the water, the water stopping effect of the sealing ring may be restored by a simple adjustment action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For achieving the above-mentioned purpose, a sealing ring may be clamped between two combined half bodies. The protruding dimension of the sealing ring may be adjusted by the clamping extent of the two bodies, thereby adjusting the water stopping effect of the sealing ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the sealing ring needs to be replaced, the user only needs to remove one half body to remove the sealing ring and replace the sealing ring, so that the sealing ring may be replaced easily and quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a careful reading of the detailed description with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, a plug structure of a liquid drainage installation in accordance with the present invention consists of a first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and a sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is a disk block, and has a first face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed with a concave <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the center of the first face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The concave <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has a bottom face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is formed with a screw hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> toward the second face <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The first face <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a peripheral surface formed with an inclined peripheral face <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which has a higher inner portion and a lower outer portion. The first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a circumferential portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed with an arched face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is an O-ring made of rubber, and has an inner diameter greater than an outer diameter of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is a disk block, and has a first face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed with a through hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> toward the second face <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The second face <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed with a lug <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> having an outer diameter smaller than that of the first face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Thus, a corner structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed between the lug <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the first face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The comer structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> between the lug <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the first face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed with an inclined peripheral face <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which has a lower inner portion and a higher outer portion. The second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has a circumferential portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed with an arched face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when in assembly, the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is mounted on the inclined peripheral face <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Because the outer diameter of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is greater than that of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the outer periphery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> protrudes outward from the circumferential portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Then, the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is mounted on the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. At this time, the lug <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is received in the concave <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, thereby positioning the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The inclined peripheral face <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is pressed on the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the outer periphery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> protrudes outward from the circumferential portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A screw <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> passes through the through hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the second body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and is locked in the screw hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to combine the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, so that the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> cannot be separated. The first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may also be combined by other locking manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The combination of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is placed in the water drain hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in a horizontal manner. At this time, the outer periphery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> protrudes outward from the circumferential portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and protrudes outward from the circumferential portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Thus, the protruding outer periphery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is closely rested on the inner wall face <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the water drain hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, thereby stopping the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The user may rotate the combination of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to the position as shown in phantom lines, so that the water drain hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is opened, thereby draining the water conveniently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the plug structure of the combination of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, although the outer periphery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> continuously rubs the inner wall face <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the water drain hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> thereby wearing the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the design of the present invention may easily overcome the wearing problem of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the inclined peripheral face <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the inclined peripheral face <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> form a clamping space <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which has a wider outer portion and a narrower inner portion. Thus, when the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is worn to affect the sealing effect, the screw <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be rotated so as to clamp the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> more closely. Thus, the clamping space <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may naturally squeeze the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> toward the inner wall face <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the water drain hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, so that the outer periphery <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is closely rested on the inner wall face <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the water drain hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When the lug <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> reaches the bottom face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the concave <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> cannot further clamp the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Thus, the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has to be replaced if it cannot stop the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Again referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the screw <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be removed for replacing the sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Then, the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the worn sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are removed from the water drain hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Then, a new sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is mounted on the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Then, the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is locked on the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by the screw <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. At this time, the new sealing ring <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> clamped between the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may efficiently provide the sealing effect. Thus, the replacement action of the present invention is very simple, so that ordinary people may accomplish the replacement work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An additional O-ring (not shown) may be mounted between the screw <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the through hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, or the screw hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be made not to pass through the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the liquid from leaking through the screw <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the through hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In addition, the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be formed with a lug, and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be formed with a concave, thereby positioning the first half body <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the second half body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The plug structure in accordance with the present invention may be used to block a liquid such as water, oil, wine, tea or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made in the embodiment without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Such modifications are all within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
