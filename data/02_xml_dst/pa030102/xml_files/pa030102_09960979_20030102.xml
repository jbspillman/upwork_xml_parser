<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical amplification system using Raman amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Arts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As a high-capacity technology, attention is being given to a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM: Wavelength Division Multiplexing) technology that allows a multiplicity of optical signals having different wavelengths to be transmitted through a single optical fiber. Moreover, in a WDM transmission system with the use of such a wavelength division multiplexing technology, a Raman amplification has been introducing to extend one span (the opposed node-to-node) interval longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Here, the Raman amplification means a technology to amplify signal lights, using an induction Raman diffusion phenomenon, one of non-linear effects within an optical fiber. When a signal light and an excitation light having shorter wavelength than that of the signal light for its specific Raman shift amount are inputted into an optical fiber, the signal light will be amplified within the optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In other words, the excitation light having shorter wavelength than that of the signal light for its specific Raman shift amount allows a dipole to be generated within the optical fiber. And, optical amplification will be carried out, when a light whose wavelength is the same as that of the signal light is radiated, while returning to the normal order, after the energy is lost for the specific number of oscillations of the excitation light, with the signal light passing through. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C show examples of a system with the use of such a Raman amplification. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C also show optical amplifiers (optical AMPS) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be placed in the optical amplification system at each node (including the terminal station node and the repeater node) of one span-to-one span connected with a transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Generally, the optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are classified into a post amplifier that serves as a power amplifier when being placed at a transmitter of the terminal station node, and a preamplifier that amplifies weak signals when being placed at a receiver of the terminal station node. Moreover, when the optical amplifier is placed at the middle point of a circuit, in short, at a repeater node, it is classified as an in-line amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> Raman excitation light source (LS)<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is placed on the side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the excitation light is sent out to an optical transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the same direction as the propagation direction of the main signal light. This mode is called a forward excitation. In a system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> Raman excitation light source <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is placed on the side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a Raman excitation light is sent out to the optical transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the reverse direction of the propagation direction of the main signal light. This mode is called a backward excitation. In addition, in a system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, the Raman excitation light sources <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are placed on the side of the optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or on the side of the amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively, and the Raman excitation light is sent out to the optical transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the same or in the reverse direction of the propagation direction of the main signal light. This mode is called a two-way excitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Here, out of the three excitation modes, in the backward excitation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) and the two-way excitation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>), the Raman excitation light is radiated in, in the reverse direction of the propagation direction of the main signal light. In such a case, at the upstream optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the Raman excitation light will be radiated in from its output side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Usually, on an optical amplifier, a laser ray having a power of 0 dBm through &plus;20 dBm will be outputted to the optical transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be connected from the output area through a connector. Due to this reason, in consideration of the safety of a person who handles the device, the optical amplifier has a function (Laser Safety function) to reduce the output of the optical amplifier, detecting a Fresnel reflection at the location where the connector coming out of the output area of the optical amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, as described above, in the backward excitation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) and the two-way excitation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>), the Raman excitation light will be radiated in from the output side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even if the connector is properly seated in place, due to the input of the Raman excitation light from the downstream, on the optical amplifier, a control function will be ON to reduce the output of the optical amplifier, misrecognizing the inputted light as a Fresnel reflection light to be generated if the connector is removed. In order to avoid such a failure, in normal operation, the Laser Safety function will be masked (stopped). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The masking treatment of the Laser Safety Function in such a normal operation will be controlled as follows, using the opposed circuit (transmission path). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the masking treatment of the Laser Safety Function, and in this drawing, opposing optical amplification systems A and B are connected with the optical transmission path (OTP)<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> having opposing transmission paths <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the optical amplification systems A and B would be the end station nodes, optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> correspond to the post amplifiers, and optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> correspond to the preamplifiers. Also, if the optical amplification systems A and B would be the relay nodes, optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> correspond to the in-line amplifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The optical amplification systems A and B are connected with the transmission path <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the downward direction (direction from the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the transmission path <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the upward direction (direction from the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The masking treatment of the Laser Safety Function will be controlled in the following procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: If there is no trouble in the optical transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (downward direction transmission path <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>), the smooth passage of signals will be checked on the side of the downstream optical amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>: The result of checking the smooth passage of signals will be transmitted to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the side of the transmission path <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in the upward direction opposing to the optical amplification system B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>: In addition, from the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the check information will be sent to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the downstream side of the optical amplification system A through the upward direction transmission path <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, with the use of SV (monitor) signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>: When the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for the optical amplification system A receives the check information, the information will be transmitted to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the side of the opposed circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>: By this procedure, to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, control is carried out to mask the Laser Safety function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Moreover, on the systems as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the following shows examinations on emergency procedures when the opposing transmission path <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is in trouble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>: When the opposing transmission path <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is OFF, S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>: At the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for the optical amplification system A, OFF state of the SV (monitor) signal will be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>: The information that the SV (monitor) signal is in the OFF state will be transmitted to the side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>: Thus, the masking treatment of the Laser Safety Function of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be released, and the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be controlled to continuously send out laser lights. However, in such a case, by releasing the masking treatment of the Laser Safety Function, the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will regard the Raman excitation light from the downstream side (side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) as the reflection light to be generated when the connector is in the removed state, thereby causing the output to be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Here, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the masking treatment of the Laser Safety Function is complicated. Also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, if the opposing transmission path has any trouble, the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be brought in the uncontrolled state because the information cannot be transmitted to the upstream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> From this reason, operators can be exposed to risks because signal lights of high output power will be continuously sent out due to the connector being removed from the amplifier. To prevent such risks, masking of the Laser Safety Function will be released. However, on the other hand, a problem can take place that a misrecognition of the input of the Raman excitation light as the Fresnel reflection light caused by removal of the connector could bring the output of the amplifier down to a safety light level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Due to this, consequences of the troubled opposing transmission path could adversely affect the signal transmission of transmission paths having no trouble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Therefore, for an optical transmission system without Raman excitation and an optical transmission system with Raman excitation, basic configuration of hardware should be changed. The change could lead up to an increase in cost for the resultant optical transmission systems. Moreover, this could be a significant bottleneck, in the event that an optical transmission system was made up without Raman excitation at the time of initial introduction, on the assumption that the optical transmission system would be sequentially extended, and a Raman excitation light source would be added as the increase in the number of wavelengths in the future. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram for an embodiment of an optical amplification system under the present invention. Also to simplify the explanation about the features of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> briefly illustrates only the post amplifier with the optical amplification system used for the end station, or only the amplifier on the output side with the optical amplification system used for the optical relay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consists of an optical fiber doped with rare earth elements including Er, etc. By the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, inputted optical signals will be amplified, and sent out to an optical transmission path (TP)<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be connected to a coupler <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through a coupler <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be inserted as a features of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Here, the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be inserted as a feature of the present invention has a band characteristic to allow the main signal light to pass through and will block the Raman excitation light (EL)sent from an opposing optical amplification system. Optical signals branched off at the coupler <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> will be detected by a light receiver element (such as a photo diode) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the output level of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be controlled by an operation circuit (OPC) <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As the Raman excitation light is blocked by the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, usually there is no optical signal to be branched off at the coupler <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and inputted to the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when a connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> comes out of place, the reflected light to be Fresnel reflected from the open end face of the connector will be branched off at the coupler <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and inputted to the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is able to detect the removed state of the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, from the reflection light of the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. And, when the removed state of the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> was detected by the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the Laser Safety function turns ON, and the output of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be reduced to a safety light level by the operation circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Here, based on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, studies are made on the attenuation amount required for the Raman excitation light blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be inserted as a feature of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> transmission path loss is assumed to be 20 dB/100 Km, and the distance of transmission path between an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the upstream side and an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the downstream side to be 100 Km through 200 Km. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the output power of a Raman excitation light source <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to be placed on the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the downstream side is &plus;20dBm, at span loss 20 dB (distance of transmission path being 100 Km), or &plus;30 dBm, at span loss 40 dB (distance of transmission path being 200 Km), the arrival level of the Raman excitation light to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is &minus;10 through 0 dBm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the minimum output value of the main signal light coming from the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is 0 through &plus;7 dBm, only when there is one wave. While the optical signal to be reflected because of the connector being removed will be attenuated 20 dB from the output power, and the minimum value for detecting reflection at the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is &minus;20 through &minus;13 dBm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the difference between the maximum value for the Raman excitation light arrival level and the minimum value for detecting reflection is 0 dBm-(&minus;20 dBm)&equals;20 dBm, and this result means the attenuation amount required for the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The Raman light blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be obtained by several methods. The following describes some of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of the embodiment to construct a blocking filter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> featuring the present invention with a reflection filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, for the main signal having wavelength of 1550 nm band, configuration is made so that on a circuit board glass, an optical reflection film that selectively reflects excitation lights of 1450 nm band is formed, and this optical reflection film is added between the coupler <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The optical refletion film can be obtained, for instance, from a multiplex interference film formed through the alternate vapor deposition of TiO and SiO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> consisting of the optical reflection film reflects the excitation light of 1450 nm band to be inputted from the output side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and optical signals of the other wavelength bands will pass through the filter. Therefore, when the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is coming out of place, the optical signals of 1550 nm band to be Fresnel reflected from the open end of the connector will pass through the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and detected by a light receiver element for detecting reflected light. By the detection output, the output power of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an embodiment to construct a blocking filter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to be inserted as a feature of the present invention using a fiber grating. The fiber grating can be obtained by a method to form a diffraction grating on the side face of a fiber, or a method to form an interference fringe on the core of a fiber with a light of high luminous intensity and form a grating to the core by optical damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Like the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in the case of the blocking filter constructed of the fiber grating, the excitation light of 1450 nm band to be inputted from the output side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be reflected, and the optical signals of the other wavelength bands will pass through the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an embodiment to construct the blocking filter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a feature of the present invention, of an attenuation film filter. It is possible to construct an attenuation filter for the Raman excitation light, in terms of equivalency, with the use of an attenuation film having a large attenuation amount, as the Raman excitation light level at the end face of the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the level of the main optical signal are large, provided that the level of the Raman excitation light to be radiated in the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for detecting reflection to be lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Here, when the blocking filter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is constructed of the reflection film as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, or the attenuation film as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it is possible to form the blocking filter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> together with the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> into one piece, instead of the blocking filter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to be put between the coupler <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In other words, it is possible to form the blocking filter by attaching the reflection film and attenuation film to the end face of the connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an example of using a separation filter as the blocking filter <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a feature of the present invention. In this example, the dielectric multilayer film is formed in a plurality of layers and located at an angle of 45 degrees. By this, a configuration is made so that the Raman excitation light to be inputted from the output side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be allowed to vertically reflect at the face of the dielectric multilayer film, and the reflection light at the time of the connector coming out of place can be allowed to go straight to the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, passing through the face of the dielectric multilayer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an example of using a waveguide type filter as a blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This example shows how to create a waveguide using a photolithography, by accumulating quartz-based glass on a metal Si circuit board by the vapor phase developing method. The direction of the waveguide is set so that the Raman excitation light to be inputted from the output side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not inputted to the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Here, each of the embodiments mainly describes about an example of using the backward excitation method. However, the application of the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and also in the two-way excitation method, the same configuration as shown in each of the embodiments can bring similar effect, as the Raman excitation light exists in the reverse direction of the main signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention can be similarly applied to the forward excitation method where the Raman excitation light is propagated in the same direction as the main signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows examinations on the detection level at the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the forward excitation method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> wave synthesizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> reflects the Raman reflection light from a Raman excitation light source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and outputs to an optical transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. While the optical main signal coming from the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is sent out to the optical transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through a wave synthesizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Here, the isolation of a wave synthesizer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is assumed to be 50 dBm, and the output level of the Raman excitation light from the Raman excitation light source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is assumed to be &plus;30 dBm. Therefore, when the Raman excitation light, the output of the Raman excitation light source <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is inputted to the wave synthesizer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the leak amount toward the side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be &minus;20 dBm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The leak amount is within the range of the detection level (&minus;20 dBm) of the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. From this reason, at the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, leaking Raman excitation light could be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the forward excitation method as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is inserted as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> with the application of the present invention. The blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be formed in the same manner of the previously described embodiment as illustrated either in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the leaking amount (&minus;20 dBm) of the raman excitation light can be blocked by the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Therefore, detecting the leaking excitation light level by the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be avoided. And such a case can also be avoided from happening, that misrecognizing the detected leaking excitation light as a sign of the disconnected connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> leads up to the control of the output level of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to bring it down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Here, description is made mainly of an example of locating the insertion position of the Raman excitation light blocking filter, to be inserted under the present invention, at the connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>-to-the coupler <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, in the embodiment as described above. The application of the present invention is not limited to such a case. The following shows other examples of applying the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an example of a system which applies the present invention to its redundancy system. Also in the following drawings, the coupler <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the light receiver element <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the operation circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are briefly noted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, as a feature of the system, an optical amplification system A and B are connected with a redundancy transmission path <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for current use or for spare. The drawing shows, as the redundancy transmission path <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, only the configuration in the direction from the optical amplification system A to the optical amplification system B, but omits the configuration in the direction from the optical amplification system B to the optical amplification system A to be connected with the redundancy transmission path for simplifying purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Each of the optical amplification system A and the optical amplification system B has optical change-over switches <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In the normal operation with the optical change-over switches <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, to the currently used transmission path which connects a connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the optical amplification system A and a connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the optical amplification system B, signals are connected and set so that signals can smoothly pass through the path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> And, in maintaining the normal operating system, by the optical change-over switches <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, signals are connected and set to a spare transmission path, which connects a connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the optical amplification system A and a connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for the optical amplification system B, so that signals can smoothly pass through the path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> On such a system as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the Raman excitation light blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be inserted under the present invention is placed on the front step of the optical change-over switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for the optical amplification system A. By this positioning, the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be a common part for the current use and spare redundancy transmission paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Here, in the description of the embodiment as described above, wavelength multiplexed optical signals having a single band is a precondition, however, the present invention can also be applied to an optical amplification system which handles wavelength multiplexed optical signals having a plurality of bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an example of applying the present invention to a system that transmits wavelength multiplexed signals having a C-band or L-band. On the optical amplification system A, the wavelength multiplexed signals having the C-band will be amplified by an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the wavelength multiplexed signals having the L-band will be amplified by an optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, then, these amplified signals will be inputted to a coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and synthesized here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> At the rear step of the coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in other words, a band pass filter or a low pass filter having the pass bands of the C-band and L-band, will be located, as a feature of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the C-band, L-band and the wavelength spectrum of the Raman excitation light against these bands. The C-band has a wavelength band of 1530 through 1560 nm, and the L-band has a wavelength band of 1570 through 1600 nm. For the medium wavelength in the zone of the C-band, the Raman excitation light of 1420 through 1450 nm having short wavelength of 110 nm will be used. Further, for the medium wavelength in the zone of the L-band, the Raman excitation light of 1460 through 1490 nm having short wavelength of 110 nm will be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> has a band filter characteristic with its pass band to be 1530 through 1600 nm band, or a low pass filter characteristic having large amount of attenuation for signals of 1490 nm wavelength or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Thus, on the optical amplification system B, the Raman excitation light from Raman excitation light sources <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, each having the wavelength of around 1450 nm or 1485 nm will be synthesized at a coupler <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and sent out to the optical amplification system A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as a principle, the Raman excitation light should be inputted through a connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the optical amplification system A, but as a matter of fact, the Raman excitation light will be blocked by the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and will not be inputted to a light receiver element, which is not noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. While the optical main signals in the zone of the C-band and the optical main signals in the zone of the L-band will be synthesized by a coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and sent out to a transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. On the optical amplification system B on the receiver side, the received wavelength multiplexed signals will be separated into the main optical signals of the C-band, or the L-band, respectively, with a wave separator <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and inputted to the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that these optical signals can be amplified to a detectable level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Here, on the optical amplification system A, if the coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is not connected, at the end face of a connector <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a Fresnel reflection takes place, and the Fresnel reflection will be inputted to a light receiver element through the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. From this input, the disconnected connector can be detected and the output power of optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be reduced, accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows an example of the configuration, where the insertion position of the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is different from the position in the configuration illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, and the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is inserted between a coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the C-band zone. In this embodiment, the coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, that synthesizes the optical main signals of the C-band zone and the L-band zone, has a wave separation characteristic in the reverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In other words, the coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a low pass function and a high pass function, and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, by the low pass function, the coupler will pass the signals having wavelengths of the L-band zone inputted from the transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and will output to the side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and by the high pass function, it will pass the signals having wavelengths of more than the C-band and will output to the side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the Raman excitation light will not be outputted to the side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. On the contrary, to the side of the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the Raman excitation lights for the C-band and L-band will be inputted. From this, a band characteristic required for the blocking filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> should be set to have the low pass function to block the signals having wavelengths of less than 1490 nm from passing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Here, in the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the end stations are supposed to be the optical amplification systems A and B, but the application of the present invention is not limited to this case. When the optical amplification systems A and B are to be the end stations, the present invention can also be applied to an optical relay to be located on the transmission path <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that connects the optical amplification systems A and B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, each corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 16</cross-reference>, show the embodiments to apply the layout of a blocking filter <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to an optical relay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the blocking filter <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is located at the rear step of a coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that synthesizes optical signals having wavelengths of the C-band and L-band coming from optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that function as inline amplifiers. On the other hand, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, between the optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the coupler <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, three blocking filters <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are located. The band characteristic of the blocking filter <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in each of the embodiments is the same as the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, explanations were already made on the optical main signals having two channels of the wavelengths of the C-band and the L-band, however, the application of the present invention is not limited to this. In other words, the present invention can similarly be applied to the O-band (around 1300 nm), E-band (around 1400 nm), S-band (around 1500 nm), L-band (around 1600 nm), U-band (around 1650 nm), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As set forth hereinabove on the embodiments with reference to the drawings, the present invention makes it possible to prevent Raman excitation lights from entering, and to keep the Laser Safety function (output drop) caused by the detection of reflection light at the time of disconnected connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the application of the present invention can facilitate the addition of a Raman excitation light source in the event of the future increase in the number of wavelengths, even if, on the assumption that an optical transmission system would be sequentially extended, the system was configured without a Raman excitation at the time of initial introduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> While illustrative and presently preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail herein, it is to be understood that the inventive concepts may be otherwise variously embodied and employed and that the appended claims are intended to be construed to include such variations except insofar as limited by the prior art. </paragraph>
