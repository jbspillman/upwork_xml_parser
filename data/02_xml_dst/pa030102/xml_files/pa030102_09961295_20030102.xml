<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical amplification block having an optical amplification fiber or other optical amplifiers and to an optical amplification system using the optical amplification block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Arts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the optical communication, an optical amplification fiber consisting of an optical fiber of an optical waveguide structure doped with rare earth elements, such as an EDF (erbium doped fiber) (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;doped fiber&rdquo;), or an optical amplification system using a semiconductor optical amplifier consisting of a semiconductor laser is widely being used. The amplifying principle of an amplification fiber on such an optical amplification system is as described below. For the wavelength (for instance, 1.55 um band) of a signal light to be amplified, an excitation light of a specified wavelength (a wavelength which is 100 nm smaller than the wavelength of a signal light: 0.98 um or 1.4 um is selected) will be waveguided into a doped fiber. Under this condition, when a signal light is supplied, the dope element in a doped fiber (in the example shown above, Er: erbium) will be excited by the excitation light and an induced emission will be generated. As a result, signal lights will be amplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Here, on the optical amplification fiber of the structure as described above, if excitation is continued by an excitation light, when signal lights will not be supplied (when input is OFF), an optical surge of large power will be outputted, when input is resumed, and optical elements (parts) in the rear can be damaged or deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Also, when the semiconductor optical amplifier is used, in order to obtain an output power which meets to an input light, a bias injection current is applied to the adjacent of a threshold of a semiconductor laser. And in order to keep the level of the output power constant, the bias injection current is controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For the reason, if any signal light is not inputted (when the input is OFF), large bias injection current will be supplied. By this, when input is resumed, an optical surge of large power will be outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, on conventional optical amplification systems, in order to judge the presence or absence of an optical input signal, part of the optical input signals is branched off by a coupler (branching device), and a level of the input light is monitored by a photodiode (PD) or other optical receiver element. When the optical input signal is down or OFF and the detected level of the optical signal becomes lower than the set value, excitation to the doped fiber is controlled to OFF (the supply of excitation light is stopped). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, when an auto control (ALC, AGC, etc.) to keep the output of the optical amplification fiber (or the semiconductor optical amplifier) constant, the coupler (branching device) is inserted to the output side of the doped fiber (or the semiconductor) to branch off part of the output. And, the branched part of the output lights is converted into electrical signals by the photodiode (PD) or other optical receiver element, while excitation lights (bias current) is controlled to bring the level to the set level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, conventional optical amplification systems needed an optical receiver element to judge the presence or absence of an optical input signal, and an optical receiver element to control an optical output, and in addition, for these optical receiver elements, such an arrangement was needed so that couplers (branching devices) to branch and input an optical input signal and optical output signal would be used in pairs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. To facilitate the understanding of the present invention, the conventional example of configuration is described in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram for an embodiment of the conventional optical amplification system. A doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constructing an optical amplification fiber is an optical amplification fiber doped with eribium (Er), one of rare earth elements (EDFA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> To the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, excitation lights that are emitted and outputted by a laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation lights will be supplied through a wave synthesizer (WSR)<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. While, signal lights will be inputted to the first branching device (FBD)<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and further inputted to the wave synthesizer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and then synthesized with the excitation light and inputted to the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the main signal light input will be optically amplified by the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputted through the second branching device (SBD)<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Here, the optically amplified main signal lights will be partially branched by the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and inputted to an optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as monitor lights. Then, the branched and outputted lights from the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be converted into appropriate electrical signals by an optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The converted electrical signals will be compared with the established comparative electric potential <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by a comparator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The bias electric potential of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light will be controlled according to the magnitude of the difference from the comparative electric potential from the comparator <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which means the magnitude of the emitted output will be controlled by the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light. By this, the output level of the optically amplified main signal lights (ASL) will be controlled to keep it constant. (ALC: Automatic Level Control). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, at the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the main signal lights will be partially separated and inputted to the second optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, electrical signals matching to the magnitude of the received main signals will be outputted. Accordingly, the voltage corresponding to the main signal lights received by the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be compared with the established reference value at a comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and if the value does not reach the reference value, a control signal will be outputted to stop emitting of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> By this operation, when main signal lights are not entered, the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light will continue emitting, and at the time when the entry of main signal lights resumes, an optical surge of a large power will be outputted, thereby enabling optical elements (component parts) in the rear to avoid possible damages or deteriorations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> However, in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, two optical receiver elements, as the first optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to detect the level of the main signals that was amplified because of the ALC and the second optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to detect the presence or absence of the input of the main signals, as well as a circuit to control these will be needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Therefore, for optical amplification systems, the present invention is to provide an optical amplification block that can avoid the need to use two optical receiver elements as described above, and an optical amplification system with the application of it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a first principle-based configuration of an optical amplification system under the present invention. Here, if an element shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and an element in the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are the same or similar, the same reference number is used. The same numbering method applies to the following embodiments. A feature shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, compared with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is the configuration where the main signals to be branched by the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is directly inputted to the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Here, the branching devices <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> have two input ports and two output ports (2&times;2), and these branching devices are configured using a fusion attached part formed by fusion attaching a fiber-to-fiber, a dielectric multilayer film or a waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The power of the main signal lights to be inputted to the first input port of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will be partially branched in the specified proportions and inputted directly to the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The output to be branched in the specified proportions of the main signal power directly inputted from the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the amplified output of a doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be inputted to an optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as a monitor light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Here, a supposition is made on a case where the input of optical main signals stopped. At this time, as the output of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> stops, the component of the main signal light to be directly inputted to the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> becomes zero. Therefore, at an optical amplifier unit which is only numbered <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> but not noted specifically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the detection output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in short, the optical signal level to be detected drops down to less than the specified value, thereby causing the OFF state of the optical main signal input to be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Based on this, the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light is controlled to stop emitting, thereby preventing the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light from being driven during the input of the optical main signal is in the OFF state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the case when the input of the optical main signal resumed, as the output of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is zero, the light to be radiated in the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is only the component of the optical input signal, thereby facilitating the detection at an optical amplification control unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In addition, the ALC compares the output from the second output port of the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with the specified value, and controls the bias of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light according to the magnitude of the difference. By this operation, the output of an amplifier can be kept constant by control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a second principle-based configuration of an optical amplification system under the present invention. In the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the configuration allows signals to be branched in the specified proportions by the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to return to the second input port of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The signals to be returned to the second input port of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will be further branched in the specified proportions by the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and inputted to the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as a monitor light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Therefore, assuming that the input of the optical main signal should stop, the monitor light to be branched by the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and inputted to the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is the light which is only equivalent to the signals that will branch from the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the specified proportions and will return to the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> From this reason, at the optical amplification control unit which is only numbered <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> but not specifically noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the detection output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in other words, the optical signal level being lower than the specified value, or the off state of the main signal light input will be detected. From the detection, the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light will be controlled to stop emitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Also, when the input of main signal lights resumes, as the output of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is zero, the light to be radiated in the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be easily detected, as it is only equivalent to the specified percentage of the optical input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the ALC compares the output from the second output port of the branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the specified value, and controls the bias of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light according to the magnitude of the difference. By this operation, the output of the amplifier can be controlled to be constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, it is possible in the present invention to use the same optical receiver elements for detecting the OFF state of the optical input and for detecting the optical signal level for the ALC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, the following shows embodiments of an optical amplification system based on the principle-based configuration. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a block diagram for an embodiment of the present invention supporting the principle-based configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> enclosed with a dotted line is an amplification block consisting of elements as noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, including an optical amplification fiber made up of a doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the first and the second branching devices <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light, and an optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. And, the second block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> enclosed with a dotted line is an optical amplification control unit as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Here, studies are made on the branching ratio at the branching devices <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> placed on the amplification block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. On the supposition that the branching ratio of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> would be (10:90), and the power of the main signal to be inputted to the first input port of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> would be A, the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will output the power of 0.9A to the first output port operatively connected to the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and output the power of 0.1A to the second output port directly connected to the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As for the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the output B of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will input to the first input port, and the branched output from the second output port of the branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will input to the second input port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the branching ratio of the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is supposed to be (10:90), 0.9B corresponding to the input B of the first input port of the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be outputted from the first output port as the amplified signal lights, together with 0.1A&times;0.1 for the power 0.1A directly inputted to the second input port. Further, from the second output port of the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, 0.1B for the input B of the first input port, and 0.1A&times;0.9 for the input 0.1A of the second input port will be outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, from the second output port of the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the optical power of 0.1B and 0.09A will be inputted to the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Here, studies are made on the case when the input of optical main signal should stop. At this time, as the output of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> stops, the output 0.09A from the second output port of the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> would be zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has two reference potentials, REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a comparative circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to input the detection output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and to control the emission of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> By the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the detection output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will be compared with the first reference potential REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for detecting the OFF state of the optical input signal. If the detection output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is lower than the specified value, the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will detect the OFF state of the optical main signal input, and output the first control signal. By this first control signal, the bias supply of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation will be suspended, and the laser emission will be stop controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the input of optical main signal resumed, as the output of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is zero, the light to be radiated in the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will be only the component of the optical input signal, (0.1A&times;0.9), thereby facilitating the detection at the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At this time, the output of the first control signal will turn OFF, and the bias will be controlled so that the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation starts emitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The ALC compares the output from the second output port of the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with the second reference potential REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and outputs the bias control signal for the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light, according to the magnitude of the difference. By this operation, the emission of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light will be controlled, and the control by the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be made to keep the output of the optical amplification fiber constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an example of a detailed circuit of the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A resistance <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in series, and converts the amperage corresponding to the magnitude of the optical signal detected by the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into the detection amperage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> This amperage is supplied to one of input ends for each of two comparative elements <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. To the other input end of the comparative element <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the first reference potential REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied, and to the other input end of the comparative element <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the second reference potential REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supplied. To the output side of the comparative element <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, a trystate inverter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is connected, and the output of this trystate inverter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is connected to the base of a transistor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, together with the output of the comparative element <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The transistor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is connected to the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light in series and controls the magnitude of its bias current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In such a configuration, when the optical input signal turns OFF and the magnitude of the detection voltage generated to a transistor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> becomes smaller than the first reference potential PEF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the outputted electrical potential of the comparative element <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> will be inverted, and the trystate inverter <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> will be shifted, so that the base electrical potential of the transistor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be clamped to the non-continuity control electrical potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> By this operation, the transistor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> will be OFF, and the bias current of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light will be also OFF, thereby allowing the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light to stop emitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, while the detected voltage is larger than the reference voltage REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the base potential of the transistor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> will be kept on to the voltage which is at least enough to maintain the transistor in the active state. And by the second comparator element <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the voltage equivalent to the difference from the second reference potential REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be supplied to the base of the transistor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the transistor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> will be able to supply the bias current corresponding to the difference from the second reference potential REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light. By this supply, the output of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be controlled to constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a block diagram for an embodiment of the present invention supporting the principle-based configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, like in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> enclosed with a dotted line is an amplification block having elements as noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and it consists of elements including an amplifier made of a doped fiber, first and second branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light, and an optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the second block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> enclosed with a dotted line is an optical amplification control unit already described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> An optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has two reference potentials REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a comparative circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to input the detected output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and to control the emission of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light. The configuration of the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is the same as the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Therefore, the reference potential RFE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be supplied to the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a reference potential to stop/control the emission of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light, in accordance with the presence or absence of the major input signal lights, and the reference potential REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a reference potential for controlling the output level of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to keep it constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, studies are made on the branching ratio at the branching devices <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> located at the amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. On the assumption that the branching ratio at the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> would be (10:90), and the power of the main signal to be inputted to the first input port of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> would be A, then, the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will output the power of 0.9A to the first output port connected to the side of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and to the second output port directly connected to the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, output the power of 0.1A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Similarly, on the assumption that the branching ratio of the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> would be (10:90), then, 0.9B corresponding to the input B of the first input port of the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be outputted from the first output port as the amplified signal light. In addition, from the second output port of the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, 0.1B corresponding to the input B of the first input port will be outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The output of 0.1B from the second output port of this branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be returned and inputted to the second input port of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and against 0.1B, the output at the ratio of 0.1 will be outputted to the first output port, and to the second output port, the output at the ratio of 0.9 will be outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Therefore, to the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the optical power of 0.1A and 0.1B will be inputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Here, studies are made on the case where the input of the optical main signal turned OFF. At this time, the output power 0.1A from the second output port of the first branching device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> would be zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As described above, to the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> located at the optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, two reference potentials, REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the detected output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be inputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> By the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the detected output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be compared with the first reference potential REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for detecting the OFF state of the optical input signal. When the optical power 0.1A from the second output port of the first branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> becomes zero, and the detected output of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes lower than the specified value, the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will detect the OFF state of the optical main signal input and output the first control signal. By the first control signal, the bias supply of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation will be turned OFF and the laser emission will be controlled to stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the input of the optical main signal resumed, the optical power to be radiated in the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is only the component of the optical input signal (0.1A), because the output of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is zero, detection can be made easily at the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. At this time, the output of the first control signal will turn OFF, and bias will be controlled so that the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation can start emitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the ALC compares the output from the second output port of the branching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the second reference potential REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and outputs the bias control signal of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light according to the magnitude of the difference. By this operation, also in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the emission of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light is controlled, and the control by the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be made to keep the output of the optical amplification fiber constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a block diagram for an embodiment of an optical amplification system applying another embodied configuration of an optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Here, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a configuration in which the optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is replaced, compared with an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, however, such a configuration can also be embodied, in which the optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is replaced, compared with an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, an optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has two comparative circuits <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The comparative circuit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> compares the reference potential ref<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the detected electrical potential, in other words, the voltage converted by a resistance <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the current detected by an optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. And, it controls the bias current of a laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light, in accordance with the magnitude of the difference outputted from the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling the amplified output of a doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be kept constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> While the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is to control the emission of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light, in accordance with the presence or absence of the input of the optical signal. As a feature, by a differentiation circuit (DFC)<highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, the differentiation value of the detected electrical potential, in other words, the voltage converted by the resistance <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the current detected by the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will be obtained. At the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the obtained differentiation value will be compared with the reference potentials ref<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and ref<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The following shows further detailed explanations about this, from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> explaining a method of detecting the OFF state of the input of optical main signals. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, by the OFF state of the input of optical main signals, the waveform (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>) will change. Therefore, by a differentiation circuit <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, at the time of the rise and the fall of the waveform in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A, a</cross-reference> pulse is generated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The comparative circuit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> compares the magnitude of a pulse at the time of the fall or the rise with the reference potential ref<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the reference potential ref<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. Therefore, the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> outputs the pulse duration equivalent to the fall duration or the rise duration of the output of the differentiation circuit <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> (in short, the time during which the input of optical main signal remains in the OFF state) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> By the output of the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light will be controlled to stop emitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Here, in each embodiment as described above, if the ALC control is performed to the optical amplification fiber, when the OFF state of the input of optical main signals should take place, the control will turn ON to the amplification fiber to keep the output constant. In this case, if the amplified signal lights form a large proportion of the output lights, as the output power will significantly go down, the OFF state of the input can be detected without being affected by the ASE (Amplified Spontaneous Emission) light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the relation between the amplified signal light and the ASE. Each peak of the amplified signal lights having the wavelengths of 1553, 1557 and 1561 nm is shown as an optical signal light of 1500 nm band. In addition, around these wavelengths, spectra of the ASE lights are shown. Therefore, when the difference between the level of the main signal light and the level of the ASE light in the output lights is large, as a change in the output level to the main signal light at the time of the input of optical main signal turns OFF is large, the OFF state can be easily detected without being affected by the ASE light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> However, if the ASE light forms a large proportion of the output light, the output power will not go down, and even if the input of optical main signal turns OFF, the detection of the OFF state may not be possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a block diagram for an embodiment conforming to the principle-based configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to deal with the inconvenience caused by such a large proportion formed by the ASE light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is briefly noted. The configuration can be made like the configuration in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. A feature of the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is the point to insert a BPF (Band Pass Filter) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in front of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, at the front step or rear step of the second branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. (In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, at the front step of the branching device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the band pass filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> By the insertion of this band pass filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, it will be possible to eliminate the ASE component to be inputted to the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it will be possible to easily detect the OFF state of the input of optical main signal, without being affected by the ASE which was increased by the ALC control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In addition, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is possible to configure by inserting an optical attenuator <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, instead of inserting the band pass filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in front of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, so that the output optical power itself of the doped fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be attenuated. In such a configuration, in order to make it possible to detect the OFF state of the input without being affected by the ASE, the output power itself must be allowed to attenuate to a level that will not affect the detection of the OFF state of the input of optical main signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Further in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is also possible to use a fiber grating instead of the band pass filter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Here, studies are made on the detection of the OFF state of the input of optical main signal in each embodiment as previously described. In each of the embodiments as described above, the ALC control controls the total power so that the detection level of the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be kept constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Therefore, from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A &amp; 11B</cross-reference> showing the relation between the main signal light and the ASE light, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A &amp; 12B</cross-reference> showing the relation of input light and the output timing of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light, explanations can be made as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> When the input of optical main signal turns OFF (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A, a</cross-reference>) from the ON state (spectrum I), this OFF state will be immediately detected, and for the purpose of the total power control by the ALC, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, the LD current (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A, b</cross-reference>) of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light will increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as shown by the spectrum II in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, the level of the ASE (Amplified Spontaneous Emission) light will be amplified, and as a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, the output detected by the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will not be less than the threshold value (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A, c</cross-reference>), thereby causing the possibility that the OFF state of the input of optical main signal may not be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, as a countermeasures, it is possible to configure the optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In other words, in the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, a</cross-reference> time constant circuit is inserted between the input and output of a comparative element <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> that compares the detection level with the reference value, by the parallel connection of a capacitor and resistance, so as to delay the control timing of the ALC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, by increasing the time constant of the time constant circuit, the timing of detecting the OFF state of the input can be delayed. Due to this operation, the LD current (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B, b</cross-reference>) of the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light will not increase, and, as shown by the spectrum III in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, the detection level by the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is the level on which only the main signal light is OFF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B, c</cross-reference>, it is possible to exactly detect the dropping output incident to the OFF state of the main signal light, by the detection before the elapsed time of the time constant set for the time constant circuit by the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Moreover, as shown by the spectrum II shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, when the time of the time constant has been elapsed, in the same manner as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, the ASE is intensified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Here, in the embodiment described above, the examples of majorly using the optical amplification fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as the optical amplifier, however, the principle of the present invention, not limited to these, but can similarly be applied to embodiments using a semiconductor optical amplifier, including a semiconductor laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a configuration supporting the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and it is an example of using a semiconductor optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consisting of a semiconductor laser, instead of an optical amplification fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as an optical amplifier. In this embodiment, the laser diode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for excitation light and the synthesizer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are not needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor laser constituting the semiconductor optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> emits when an electron and a hole are re-combined in the activated layer area, and the light emitted by the re-combination will go and return the activated layer by a feedback action. Because of this reason, emission caused by the re-combination will be promoted, and induced emitted, thereby causing an optical amplifier action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it has a current/optical output characteristic, and an optical output is obtained in an approximate proportion to the injection bias current more than excitation threshold. Further, with the injection bias current supposed to be constant, when the electron and hole are generated by the external input light, the amplified optical output that matches the input light is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, in accordance with such a principle and based on the magnitude of the optical output to be detected by the optical receiver element <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the detection of the OFF state of the input light, at the optical amplification control unit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, with the output of the comparative circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, controls the injection bias current of the semiconductor optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and further controls the ALC control and the laser ray from the optical amplification control unit at the time when the input light OFF to stop oscillating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> For the embodiment using the optical amplification fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, like the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> configuration using a semiconductor optical amplifier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As set forth hereinabove about the embodiment with reference to the drawing, the present invention can reduce the number of optical receiver elements, thereby enabling the peripheral circuits for controlling the optical receiver elements to be omitted. By virtue of this, it is possible to provide a gain block with an optical amplification fiber of simple structure, and an optical amplification system using the amplification block. </paragraph>
