<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing semiconductor device; and, more particularly, to a method for manufacturing semiconductor device capable of obtaining a low resistance in a self-align TiSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, in a method for manufacturing semiconductor device that requires a high integration and a high speed, researches for a low resistance of a connecting material has been proceeded for reducing a parasite resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For example, in case of multilayer interconnection, a grain size of an Al becomes larger and is highly orientated to guarantee the reliability of metal wires. Meanwhile, a Cu material is considered as a metal interconnection, instead of Al material, to guarantee the reliability and to realize low resistance. In case of conductive metal wires, such as a gate electrode and a bit line, silicide layers using Ti, Co and Ni are employed as metal interconnection, instead of silicide layers which are formed by Mo and W, in order to carry out a low temperature process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned silicide using Mo and W is hard to get low resistivity of below 80 &mgr;&OHgr;cm at a temperature of below 800&deg; C. However, in a TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer of a C54 phase, it is possible to obtain low resistivity of about 13 to 20 &mgr;&OHgr;cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer can exist as an orthorhombic base-centered phase (hereinafter, referred to as a C49 phase) which has high resistivity of about 30 to 60 &mgr;&OHgr;cm and as an orthorhombic face-centered phase (hereinafter, referred to as a C54 phase) which is stabilized in thermal dynamics and has low resistivity of about 12 to 20 &mgr;&OHgr;cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C are cross-sectional views illustrating a conventional TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer manufacturing method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> field oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which isolates between devices is formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are successively formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. At this time, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be a polysilicon layer, a metal layer or a stacked layer of a polysilicon and a metal layer, and preferably a polysilicon layer is used as a single layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a low concentration diffusion layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through a light dopant ion injection by using the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as a mask, and a sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which are in contact with sidewalls of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, are formed by depositing an insulating layer on the resulting structure and by etching back the insulating layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A high concentration diffusion layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that is connected to the low concentration diffusion layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed through high dopant ion injection by using the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as a mask. Where, the low concentration diffusion layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is referred to as a lightly doped drain (LDD) and the high density dopant diffusion layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is usually called as a source/drain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A Ti layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited on the resulting structure by using a physical vapor deposition (EVD) at a temperature of about 400&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, an unstable C49 phase TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed through Ti diffusion from the Ti layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the silicon layers including the gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a source/drain <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is caused by carrying out a rapid thermal process (RTP) in a nitrogen atmosphere. However, the C49 phase TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> has high resistivity of about 30 to 60 &mgr;&OHgr;cm because a phase transition to a C54 phase is not performed yet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, the C49 phase TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is phase transited to a C54 phase TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is stable and has a low resistance, by carrying out the thermal treatment again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, recently, with a high integration of a semiconductor device, the width of the gate electrode and the diffusion layer is getting narrower so that it is difficult to achieve a phase transition from a C49 phase TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of high resistance to a C54 phase TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of low resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The reason is that, with downsizing of a semiconductor device and reducing a gate line width, so a nuclear formation in a C54 phase, which is generated within C49 phase TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer by reacting the titanium layer on the silicon layer, is difficult. Since a nuclear formation of the C54 phase is generated at a grain boundary which is formed by gathering three grains, the number of nuclears of the C54 phase per unit area is differentiated in sizes of the grains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As described above, the size of the grain of C49 phase, which is formed on a top portion of a gate by reacting the Ti layer and the polysilicon layer, is over 0.20 &mgr;m. Therefore, if a line width of the gate electrode is below 0.25 &mgr;m, the number of nuclears of the C54 phase formed per unit area is rapidly decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With the reason, in a device which has a minimum line width of about 0.25 &mgr;m, the width of the Ti layer which is required in threshold nuclear formation to generate a phase transition, is larger than 0.25 &mgr;m, so that a phase change from C49 structure to C54 structure is not happened. Therefore, a resistance value of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer in a gate electrode and a dopant diffusion layer is rapidly increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> To solve the above-mentioned problem, As ions are injected into the required areas, such as the gate electrode and the source/drain, before depositing the Ti layer in order to apply the pre-amorphization implatation (PAI) the diffusion layer and the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> However, the PAI injects the As dopants into the diffusion layer, which has a dose of over 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, thereby reducing a reaction speed when the Ti thin layer reacts on the silicon layer in the silicide process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in a logic device, an amount of dopants and distribution within a polysilicon gate electrode of an NMOS transistor are changed by the PAI using the As dopants. Therefore, in a device which has a line width lower than 0.25 &mgr;m, a characteristic thereof is changed and it is also differentiated according to a wafer location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Besides the As ions, a high concentration diffusion layer, specifically, other ions injected to a source/drain of an N-channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) transistor generally decrease a diffusion speed of a silicon atom, thereby to decrease the reaction speed of the silicide process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a thickness of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer formed in an NMOS transistor is getting thinner by ions that are injected to a source/drain and injected for PAI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Besides, a nitride gas used in the RTP is also preventing the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>nuclear formation and it makes thinner a thickness of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer, thereby to increase a resistance than a TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer of a PMOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Also, in a post thermal treatment process, the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer, which has a thinner thickness, is thermally unstable as the thickness is thinner and easily coheres so that the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer is easily cut with more increase of the its resistance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing semiconductor device capable of preventing high resistance from being caused by a thickness reduction of a TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer and guaranteeing a thermal stable from cohesion or cutting of a TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer in a post thermal process. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, a method for manufacturing semiconductor device according to the present invention will be described in detail referring to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C are cross-sectional views showing a method for manufacturing semiconductor device in accordance with the present invention. An N-channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) transistor is only described among a CMOS manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> filed oxide layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to isolate between devices, and a gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are successively formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. At this time, the gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be a stacked layer of a metal or polysilicon layer and a metal layer, and a single layer of polysilicon layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Next, an N<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> diffusion layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which is a lightly doped drain (LDD) region, is formed in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through a low concentration ion injection by using the gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as an ion blocking layer. Subsequently, an insulating layer is deposited on the resulting structure and a blanket etching is carried out to form sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which are in connect with sidewalls of the gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> dopant diffusion layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the N&minus; dopant diffusion layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, is formed through a high concentration ion injection by using the gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as an ion blocking mask. At this time, in case of forming the N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> dopant diffusion layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, As ions are injected. Also, in case of a PMOS transistor (not shown), a P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> dopant diffusion layer may be formed through an ion injection of boron (B) or BF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ions in a predetermined portion of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> After the N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> dopant diffusion layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed, a first thermal process is carried out in an atmosphere of any one selected from the group consisting of NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and Ar gas, thereby activating dopants&apos;diffusion into the N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> dopant diffusion layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At this time, the first thermal process is carried out at a temperature of approximately 950&deg; C. to 1050&deg; C. and for about 30 to 40 seconds, by using a rapid thermal process (RTP) device at a nitrogen atmosphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> First and second metal layers are successively deposited in the resulting structure of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. First, a Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is deposited at a thickness of about 200 &angst; to 450 &angst; and then a TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is deposited at a thickness of about 50 &angst; to 120 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> deposition is carried out at a temperature of about 100&deg; C. to 400&deg; C. and for about a few seconds within a physical vapor deposition (PVD) chamber. The deposition of the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is carried out at a temperature of below 100&deg; C. to 400&deg; C. and for about a few seconds within another chamber of the same physical vapor deposition (PVD) chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is deposited over a thickness of 120 &angst;, a lot of time is required to remove it in the following removing process. The TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is deposited for the purpose of preventing a diffusion of a nitride gas at the time forming a TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer in the subsequent process, so it may not be deposited over a thickness of 120 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When the Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are formed, the heat temperature of the semiconductor substrate is preferably carried out at a temperature, which provides the lowest resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As described above, the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is deposited on the Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to prevent exposure of the Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> before a rapid thermal treatment for forming a silicide layer so that the Ti <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> layer is protected from a native oxide layer formation followed by a long period exposure a dopant generating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, after the Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the TiN <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> layer are deposited at a predetermined sequence. Therefore, the increase of the thickness of the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has an effect on the formation of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer. The additionally formed TiN layer prevents the nitrogen gas from diffusing into the Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the thermal process in the nitrogen atmosphere, thereby to guarantee the formation of the predetermined TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are formed on an upper portion of an N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> dopant diffusion layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the increase of the thickness of the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has an effect on the formation of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer. The additionally formed TiN layer prevents the nitrogen gas from diffusing into the Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the thermal process in the nitrogen atmosphere, thereby to guarantee the formation of the predetermined TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer. This second thermal process is carried out at a temperature of about 650&deg; C. to 715&deg; C., about 10 to 30 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As described above, the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed by the second thermal process are formed at a thickness of about 380 &angst; to 850 &angst; by reacting the Ti <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> layer on the Si layer of the N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> dopant diffusion layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. At this time, a non-reacted Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is remnant on the sidewall spacers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the field oxide layer. Also, since a predetermined thickness of Ti is activated, a non-reacted Ti layer may be remnant on the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer. Since the second thermal process is carried out at a temperature of about 650&deg; C. to 715&deg; C., the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer has an unstable C49 phase and high resistivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Besides, when the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed through a thermal process at a nitrogen atmosphere, additional TiN layer is formed so that a thickness of the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is slightly increased. Therefore, the increase of the thickness of the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has an effect on the formation of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer. The additionally formed TiN layer prevents the nitrogen gas from diffusing into the Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the thermal process in the nitrogen atmosphere, thereby to guarantee the formation of the predetermined TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As a result, since the increase of the thickness of the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> prevents the diffusion of the nitrogen gas, the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed with a sufficient thickness without a loss of the silicide layer. In the CMOS technique, the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer may have the same thickness in the NMOS and PMOS transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the non-reacted Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which are not associated with the silicide reaction, are removed and a third thermal process is carried out. At this time, the third thermal process is carried out at a temperature of about 800&deg; C. to 850&deg; C. and for about 10 to 30 seconds, and the C49 phase, which is formed by the second thermal treatment, is phase transited to a stable C59 phase, thereby reducing resistivity of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, when removing the non-reacted Ti layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the TiN layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, a wet etching is used and using a mixed solution of NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O at a ratio of 1:1:5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Typically, when the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer is formed without a pre-amorphization implantation (PAI) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer is increased from 400 &angst; to 480 &angst;, comparing the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer formed by the PAI. Also, resistance is decreased from 4.4 &OHgr;/&square; to 3.3 &OHgr;/&square;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned self-aligned TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>manufacturing method may deposit the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer in a same thickness in NMOS and PMOS transistors by using the TiN layer, thereby preventing low resistivity and cohesion and a cutting through increased thickness of the TiSi<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer in a post thermal process so that a device yield and operation characteristic may be also improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiments of the invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
