<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a variable displacement swash plate type compressor for use in an air conditioner of an automobile, and more particularly, to a thrust bearing structure for supporting a driving shaft thereof in an axial direction wherein a correlation between an inner and an outer diameters of a stationary and a driving races and a center bore and an outer diameter of a driving shaft is specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, a variable displacement swash plate type compressor is used for controlling an amount of a fluid to be ejected by increasing or decreasing a piston stroke depending on an inclination angle of a swash plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, constitution and operation of a general variable displacement swash plate type compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described. The variable displacement swash plate type compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> including a center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a plurality of cylinder bores <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> radially formed around the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, both sides of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being hermetically covered with a front housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a rear housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Between the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the front housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, an airtight crank chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed, and between the back end of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the rear housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a valve plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is interposed. Further, the rear housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with an inlet and an outlet for a refrigerating gas, a suction chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a discharge chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The refrigerants in the suction and the discharge chambers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> flow into/from each of the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through a suction and a discharge valve mechanisms. A driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is installed at a central portion of the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the driving shaft extending through the front housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> into the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported by radial bearings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which are installed at the front housing <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and one end thereof is axially supported by a support to prevent the driving shaft <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from moving the axial direction. The cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is coupled to the front and the rear housings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a through bolt <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the crank chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a rotor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted around the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extending across the crank chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the rotor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> rotates together with the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is rotatably installed around the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, between the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> a spherical sleeve may be interposed. In this case, the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported by an outer surface of the spherical sleeve. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is positioned at a maximum angle of the inclination. In this case, a stop surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a protuberance <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the rotor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a spring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is compressed in the maximum state. Therefore, the rotor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> confines a maximal angle of the inclination of the swash plate. Further, the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with a stopper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for defining the minimum angle of the inclination of the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further, the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the rotor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are connected with each other through a hinge mechanism so that they rotate together. To be more specific, a support arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> protrudes outwardly from one side of the rotor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the axial direction of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and an arm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends from one side of the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the support arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The arms <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are connected to each other through a pin <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is slidably disposed in each of the cylinder bores <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, each of the pistons <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having a body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> slidably installed in the cylinder bore <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a bridge <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The bridge <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a recess <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in which a portion of the outer periphery of the swash plate is positioned. The hemispherical shoe <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are installed at the shoe pocket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> formed in the bridge <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and slidably engaged with both sides of the outer peripheral portion of the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Consequently, during the rotation of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> rotates also, and the rotational movement of the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is converted into the reciprocation of the piston through the shoe <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has at its one end a cutout portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The cutout portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> functions to prevent the swash plate <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the body <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from coming into contact with each other when the piston <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> reaches a bottom dead point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the support mechanism <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for axially supporting the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned in the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and includes a driving race <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> closely fixed at one side of a thrust bearing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which is provided around the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so as to rotate together with the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a stationary race <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> closely fixed at the other side of a thrust bearing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so as to be stationary independent on the rotation of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The support mechanism <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> further includes a resilient member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which supports the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by axially supporting the thrust bearing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and races <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In such a compressor, since the driving race <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> should be rotated together with the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, its inner diameter (d1) has to be almost the same as an outer diameter (d2) of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and since the stationary race <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> should be kept stationary in the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, its outer diameter (D3) has to be almost the same as a diameter (d4) of the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, in a prior art compressor, a distance (Lr1) between the inner diameter (d3) of the stationary race <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the outer diameter (d2) of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is smaller than a distance (Lr2) between the outer diameter (D3) and a surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the stationary race <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may be eccentrically assembled with the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance, e.g., &lgr; (he maximum eccentric distance) during assembling process. In this case, an inner periphery of the stationary race <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and an outer periphery of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> come into contact with each other to generate a frictional heat, thereby deteriorating durability of the compressor. Further, abrasive particle due to the contact (c) between the stationary race <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> disturbs the flow of the refrigerants, thereby lowering the cooling performance of the air conditioner. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTIN OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, there is a longitudinal sectional view of the inventive variable displacement swash plate type compressor improving a correlation between an inner and an outer diameter of a driving and a stationary races and a center bore and an outer diameter of a driving shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the prior art, a driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are closely fixed at both sides of a thrust bearing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, respectively. When viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at the left side rotates together with the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at the right side is close to one end of a resilient member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to support both of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the thrust bearing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In order to rotate the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> together with the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and fix the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the invention changes the correlations between the inner and the outer diameters of the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the outer diameter of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a diameter (d4) of the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in which the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is designed to have the inner diameter (d1) almost equal to the outer diameter (d2) of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to be fixedly engaged with the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Further, the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is designed to have the inner diameter (d3) greater than the outer diameter (d2) of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to prevent the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> from coming into contact with the outer periphery of driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. That is, the inner diameter (d1) of the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is smaller than the inner diameter (d3) of the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (d1&lt;d3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the correlations between the inner and the outer diameters of both the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the diameter of the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the outer diameter of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should satisfy the following relationship: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Lr1&gt;Lr2 and Lf2&gt;Lf1 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> where, Lr1 is a distance between the outer diameter (d2) of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner diameter (d3) of the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>; Lr2 is a distance between the outer diameter (D3) of the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>; Lf1 is a distance between the outer diameter (d2) of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner diameter (d1) of the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>; and Lf2 is a distance between the outer diameter (D1) of the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Therefore, since the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> does not come into contact with the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can rotate smoothly, and since the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> does not come into contact with the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the center bore <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, it can rotate smoothly. Further, since there is no frictional load, the service life of the compressor is extended and the noise of the compressor is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, from the inside of the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> toward the outside, the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the thrust bearing <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are assembled to the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in order. In this case, since the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are similar to each other in shape, there is a likelihood that the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> be mis-assembled in a reverse order. Accordingly, it is preferable that their sizes are different from each other so as to be visually distinguished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be fabricated in such a way that the outer diameter (D1) of the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the outer diameter (D3) of the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are different to each other. In this case, it is preferable that the outer diameter (D1) of the driving race is smaller than the outer diameter (D3) of the stationary race 82 (D1&lt;D3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the races <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are assembled to the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, they are visually distinguishable, thereby preventing the mis-assembly thereof. For example, the stationary race <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which has the outer diameter smaller than that of the driving race <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferentially assembled to the driving shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, since the stationary race does not contact with the driving shaft can rotate smoothly. Further, since there is no frictional load, the service life of the compressor is extended and the noise of the compressor is reduced. In addition, since the outer diameters of the races and they are visually distinguishable, it is possible to correctly select the assembling order and to easily and precisely practice the assembly thereof. </paragraph>
