<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to substrate bonding techniques. More particularly, the invention relates to techniques for providing high strength and high quality bonding techniques for fabricating multilayered substrates. Such substrates include semiconductors, silicon-on-insulator substrates, compound semiconductors, ceramic packaging materials, and metallic and nonmetallic films. The substrates can be used for the manufacture of semiconductor devices, MEMS, photonic devices, waveguides, ink head and other dispensing devices, polymeric coated or polymeric devices, and laminated devices, as well as biomedical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventional wafer bonding includes &ldquo;direct&rdquo; wafer bonding of silicon wafers, which attach themselves to each other by placing faces of such wafers directly together. Direct bonding has often been considered as an alternative to using organic or inorganic bonding agents for bonding silicon and a number of other semiconductor materials. For example, direct bonding can be facilitated by first activating the surface of the wafer with a NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH based solution for silicon and its oxides. For nitrides such as A1N and Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>an acid bath or an HF dip might be used. Plasma exposure has been another technique for activating the surfaces of wafers to be bonded. A pioneering technique that has been developed for such plasma exposure is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,496, entitled &ldquo;In Situ Plasma Wafer Bonding Method,&rdquo; in the name of Farrens, et al, commonly assigned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. Such surface activation methods render the wafer surfaces hydrophilic and amenable to bonding. After surface activation, the wafers can be placed in a spinner where they may be rinsed in de-ionized water or other chemical agent. The wafers are then placed surface to surface, at which point van der Waals forces pull the two wafers into contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The contact bonds, which are formed in accordance with conventional wet surface activation, are generally weak, and not suitable for device processing. This is because the process of oxidation (or corrosion of any kind), which is the underlying mechanism of all high temperature direct bonding of semiconductor materials, is the result of a two step process: (1) migration of the reacting species to the reaction site and (2) the subsequent chemical reaction itself. The energy that must be supplied to the &ldquo;system&rdquo; to cause the silicon and the oxygen atoms to migrate and react is quite large, and as such this particular reaction is not self-sustaining at low temperatures. Therefore, the bonds have been typically strengthened by high temperature anneals for silicon and its oxides, and moderate temperature anneals for nitrides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Other limitations also exist using conventional bonding techniques. For example, plasma activation bonding of substrates can cause plasma damage to surfaces of the substrates before bonding. Such damage can lead to lower bond quality as well as resulting damage to devices fabricated on such bonded substrates. Some of the damage caused by plasma activation can be repaired, at least in part, by heat treatment of the bonded substrates. Heat treatment, however, is not generally desirable for the manufacture of substrates using conventional layer transfer techniques using hydrogen species. Such hydrogen species often diffuse out of the substrate during high temperature thermal treatment, which leads to difficulty in transferring such layer using one of a variety of separation techniques. These and other limitations of conventional bonding techniques have been described throughout the present specification and more particularly below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> From the above, it is seen that an improved technique for bonding substrates together is highly desirable. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, techniques for bonding substrates together are provided. More particularly, the invention provides a method and apparatus for using multiple frequencies in a plasma environment for activating surfaces of substrates before bonding them together. Although the invention has been applied to the manufacture of semiconductor wafers, it would be recognized that the invention has a much broader range of applicability such as the manufacture of semiconductor devices, MEMS, photonic devices, ink head and other dispensing devices, polymeric coated or polymeric devices, waveguides and other photonic applications, and laminated devices, as well as biomedical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for bonding surfaces of different substrates together. The method includes providing a first substrate having a first surface to be bonded. The method also includes supplying a gas; and igniting the gas to produce plasma using a first frequency signal (e.g., RF frequency) from an electro-magnetic source. The method also includes producing a second signal and applying the second frequency signal (e.g., RF frequency) to the plasma to maintain the plasma on the first substrate. The first surface of the first substrate is exposed to the plasma being driven by the second frequency without substantial etching of the first surface. In some embodiments, this process may be repeated for the first surface of the second substrate although this is not needed for all applications. The method then contacts the first surface of the first substrate to a first surface of a second substrate to produce a bond there between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the invention includes an apparatus for bonding substrates together. The apparatus has a work chamber for receiving therein one or more substrates. The apparatus also has a first electrically conductive platen disposed in the work chamber; and a second electrically conductive platen disposed in the work chamber and spaced apart from the first platen by a distance d. A first signal feedthrough is coupled to the first platen for receiving a first frequency signal (e.g., RF). A second frequency signal (e.g., RF) feedthrough is coupled to the second platen for receiving a second frequency signal having a frequency less than a frequency of the first frequency signal. The work chamber has a gas inlet for receiving a gas. The gas is ignited to form a plasma by the first frequency signal. A surface of a substrate is disposed in electrical contact with the second platen is exposed to the plasma. The first signal is also such that the plasma will not substantially etch the surface, since it is maintained away from the surface. In some embodiments, two or more wafers are in the chamber and such wafers are biased to the second platen at the second frequency, where they are simultaneously activated. After such activation, they can be joined together in the chamber or removed to a separate chamber for joining, which bond the wafers together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Numerous benefits are achieved by way of the present invention. For example, the invention can be used with conventional process technology. Additionally, the invention can be used to effectively bond wafers together without substantially damaging them using plasma tools. Here, the damage is the type that causes undesirable yield and/or quality problems (e.g., unacceptable). In other embodiments, the invention can produce a high quality bond at lower temperatures, which is effective for certain layer transfer operations, such as a controlled cleaving processes or a thermal separation process. Depending upon the embodiment, there can be one or more of these benefits. These and other benefits are described in more detail throughout the present specification and more particularly below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The teachings of the present invention can be readily understood by considering the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, techniques for bonding substrates together are provided. More particularly, the invention provides a method and apparatus for using multiple frequencies in a plasma environment for activating surfaces of substrates before bonding them together. Although the invention has been applied to the manufacture of semiconductor wafers, it would be recognized that the invention has a much broader range of applicability such as the manufacture of semiconductor devices, MEMS, ink head and other dispensing devices, polymeric coated or polymeric devices, photonic devices, waveguides and other photonic applications, and laminated devices, as well as biomedical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a simplified cross-sectional schematic view of a work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> adapted for plasma activation in accordance with a particular illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The work chamber comprises a lower base portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a lower chamber wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and an upper chamber portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The lower base portion is separably coupled to the lower chamber wall. An O-ring <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is provided between the lower base portion and lower chamber wall to provide a vacuum seal. Similarly, the lower chamber wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is separably coupled to the upper chamber portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and achieves a vacuum seal with the upper chamber portion by way of an O-ring <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. An upper lid <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> engages an upper surface of the lid <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> via an O-ring <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. The assembly collectively defines an interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> within which the wafer bonding activation occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In one variation of the illustrated embodiment, the sub-assembly comprising the lower base portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the lower chamber wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and the upper chamber portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> might be constructed as a single member. However, having separate members facilitates access to the interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Also, having separate members facilitates access to the interior for cleaning purposes and other general maintenance activities. This and other configurations are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Within the interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, an electrically conductive lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is disposed upon the lower base portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The lower platen is held in substantially fixed relation to the lower base portion. A quartz diffuser <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is disposed between the lower platen member and the lower base portion. The quartz diffuser acts as an insulator to provide electrical isolation of the lower platen member from the lower base portion. The quartz diffuser also defines the gas flow such that turbulence is reduced and particle generation is limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring for a moment to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, in another embodiment of the invention, the lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> might be configured with one or more magnets <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> disposed in the lower platen. The magnet(s) serves to focus and confine the plasma during a plasma activation operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> for a moment, an illustrative embodiment of the quartz diffuser <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is shown. The quartz diffuser comprises a quartz disk <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> having openings <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> formed through its thickness t. As will be discussed in further detail below, these openings are aligned with lift pins <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and are provided so that the lift pins can pass through the diffuser. A plurality of quartz fins <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> are arranged on a bottom surface of the quartz disk <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. These fins provide a means for reducing turbulence within the chamber during processing. While the disclosed arrangement has been observed to be efficacious, other configurations and arrangements might be possible. An opening <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> is provided through one of the fins for an RF feedthrough, as will be discussed below. Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an electrically conductive upper platen member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is disposed above the lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (shown in phantom lines) is disposed upon the lower platen. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the upper platen is spaced apart from an upper surface of the substrate by a distance &ldquo;d.&rdquo; The range of separation is about 1 mm to about 150 mm. As will be discussed below, the desired separation &ldquo;d&rdquo; for any given apparatus is a function of the geometry of the interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and of the internal components. The separation might be determined first by making a calculation to arrive at a rough estimate. Then a desired value is obtained empirically, by manual adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a particular illustrated embodiment of the present invention, a silicon coating is provided on the interior surfaces of the upper lid <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the upper chamber portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the lower chamber wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and the lower base portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The lower platen <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and upper platen <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are also provided with a silicon coating. Amorphous silicon is used in SOI (silicon on insulator) production because it can only act as a self contaminate. The amorphous nature of the coating allows for less chipping due to lack of grain boundaries and is less prone to RF arcing from the plasma source. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of metallic contaminats into amorphous silicon is extremely limited. Thus the coating is self protecting. The coating functions best when it is conducting or semiconducting. The silicon is a preferred choice to silicon dioxide. For non-SOI based applications other coatings could be applied. For example, anodized aluminum for ceramic packing applications can be used. The silicon coating may be deposited using a CVD type deposition method. The silicon coating provides a conductive surface within the interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to facilitate the conduction of the plasma. The silicon coating also serves to reduce contamination during the plasma treatment of the substrate surface. The use of other coatings or simply leaving the interior surfaces un-coated may result in the production of contaminants, which adversely affect the product functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A quartz insulator ring <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is disposed between the upper platen member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the upper chamber portion <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The quartz insulator ring provides electrical insulation between the upper platen member and the upper chamber portion. A pair of O-rings <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> are disposed respectively between the lower surface of the upper chamber lid and the quartz insulator ring and between the quartz insulator ring and the upper platen member. Both the quartz insulator ring <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the quartz diffuser <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are preferably annealed to substantially reduce stress in the material. All edges including inside edges of openings formed through the quartz components are rounded in order minimize arcing, and fired to ensure clean surfaces that are free of contaminating particles. Edges, comers etc. of coated parts can be rounded and finished to prevent arcing. Interior chamber parts can be rounded and finished to prevent arcing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A first radio frequency (RF) source <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is provided to produce a first RF signal. The RF signal is coupled to the upper platen member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via a conventional and commercially available RF electrical feed-through <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The feedthrough comprises a receptacle portion, which is press-fit into an opening in the upper platen member. An opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is provided through the upper lid <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The RF feedthrough includes a cable portion, which couples to the receptacle, through the opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. A second radio frequency source <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is provided to produce a second RF signal that is coupled to the lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> via a second vacuum sealed RF feedthrough <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. An O-ring <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is provided to ensure a vacuum seal where the second RF feedthrough enters through an opening <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> formed through the lower base portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. As noted above an opening <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> is provided through the quartz diffuser <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, allowing for the second RF feedthrough to couple to the lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the RF generators were obtained from Advanced Energy Model LF5, capable of producing a tunable 50 KHz-400 KHz signal at 500W. Preferably, the second source has a lower frequency and lower power. Such lower frequency and lower power biases the plasma ions onto the substrate surface but does not cause damage of the first source, which is often higher power. The plasma ions are deposited onto the surface rather that injected into the surface due to the lower frequency of the second source. This prevents surface damage to the substrate that might result in etching or electrical properties damage to the substrate or device being activated for bonding. By balancing the source and bias frequencies with respect to the cyclotron frequency it is possible to sustain the plasma with the source power supply maximizing the number of ions by limiting recombination. The bias power supply couples the ions onto the surface. The power settings are adjusted to reach ignition for a given operating gas pressure with the source power supply. The bias power supply is adjusted for a given dielectric constant of the substrate so that the ions are attracted to the surface of the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment, a vacuum T fitting <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is provided to access the vacuum system and the gas source(s) A first function of the vacuum T fitting <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is to evacuate the interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to create a vacuum therein. A second function of the source <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is to provide the gas, which will serve as the plasma. The vacuum and gas source is coupled to the lower base portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> via an O-ring <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A lift pin assembly <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is provided to receive a substrate and lower it onto the lower platen. It is also used to lift a treated wafer (shown at the phantom lines) off the surface of the lower platen <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> upon completion of a plasma treatment in accordance with the invention. The lift pin assembly comprises a plurality of lift pins <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and includes actuators (not shown <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is the actuators) for remotely actuating the lift pins, for example by computer control. The lower base portion and the quartz diffuser <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> have correspondingly aligned openings formed there through for each of the lift pins. The lift pin assembly is coupled to the lower base portion <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. An O-ring <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> disposed about the set of lift pins ensures a vacuum-sealed coupling of the lift pin assembly to the lower base portion. Lift pins are lined with quartz sleeves to prevent plasma etching of metal surfaces that might result in chamber and sample contamination. The ends of the lift pins have Teflon bumpers to prevent backside scratching of the substrate surfaces and also facilitate the vacuum seal of the lift pins against the wafer backside to prevent wafer slippage during transport into and out of the process chamber. In preferred embodiments, the platen has a surface with concentric ring structures, where each of the rings is separated by a recessed region or groove. Such groove has a sufficient depth and thickness to prevent a substrate from sticking to the surface of the platen. Of course, the exact size and shape of each groove depend upon the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Refer now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for a general cross-sectional view of the lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A major area <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of the upper surface of the lower platen member is recessed. An annular shoulder <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> circumscribes the recessed area <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. The purpose of the recess is to often prevent the wafer from sliding on the platen. It is centered in the chamber. The lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has openings formed therethrough for the lift pins <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of the lift pin assembly <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, to allow the lift pins to extend above the surface of the recessed area <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> thus lifting a wafer (shown with phantom lines) into a position for removal. Though the figure shows three such openings <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, it is understood that the lower platen member will be provided with a sufficient number of openings to accommodate all of the lift pins. The bottom surface of the lower platen member has a blind hole <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, which is provided as a coupling location for an RF feedthrough from the second radio frequency (RF) generator <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The outer edge <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the annular shoulder <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is radiused, for example by machining, to have a smooth curve. A transition region <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> between the recessed area <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and the annular shoulder <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is similarly machined. In a particular instance, an inner comer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of the shoulder is machined to provide a curved profile. The curved profile of the inner corner <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> continues along a gradual bevel <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> to an inside comer <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> having a smoothly curved profile and terminates in the recessed area 232. The purpose of the curved profiles is to prevent arc formation, since arcing tends to produce contamination by sputtering. The holes <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are similarly radiused and smoothed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Refer now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for a discussion of plasma activation in accordance with the invention. The figure shows the plasma activation chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in relation to the components, which collectively constitute the plasma activation system. In a particular embodiment of the invention plasma activation is initiated in a computer-controlled manner. This has the advantage of repeatability and flexibility in fine tuning a plasma activation procedure, and facilitates experimental runs. A plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> might be provided by a general purpose CPU; for example, a PC-based computer running dedicated software. Alternatively, the plasma controller might be implemented in a microcontroller architecture or a combination of timers and relays, which provide logic and control aspects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may include a remote control front end controller or interface <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which communicates directly with the cluster tool computer. The remote control front end is used to switch the controller from manual control to automated control. This allows the service engineers to gain control over the individual tool functions during service and repair operations. Interaction occurs by exchanging user signals <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> to initiate actions on the system and to receive feedback from the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> issues signals <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> to the RF generators <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, respectively. These control signals turn the power on and off to the platen while the frequencies, power settings, and processing time of the generated RF signals generally present on the generators themselves. In a separate embodiment it is possible to implement full computer over the RF generator functions including selection of frequencies, power settings, and process time. Each RF generator <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> has a corresponding match unit <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, respectively to match the electrical characteristics of the output of the generator to the respective lower and upper platen members <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to achieve maximum signal transfer. As noted, the supplies are matched and out of phase so that the method can operate efficiently. The frequencies of the two RF generators are not usually integral numbers of each other to prevent signal feedback of one RF source into another, but may be in some embodiments. A roughing pump <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, e.g., a conventional dry mechanical pump, is used during the plasma activation and bonding operation. It is selectively brought into fluidic communication with the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by a roughing valve <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> under the control of a signal <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight> produced by the plasma activation controller. The roughing pump evacuates the work chamber, and is used during the backfill phase of the activation process and also during venting operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>MFC (mass flow controller) provides the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas to produce the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma within the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> issues signals <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> to control the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>source and valve in a cooperative manner to feed the gas into the work chamber thereafter it is ignited to produce the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma. In other embodiments of the invention, it is understood that other gases can be used to produce other plasma species. For example, hydrogen, argon, water, nitrogen, ammonia, and peroxide vapor, are among usable alternate gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An analog convection transducer <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> measures the interior pressure within the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It provides pressure measurements to the plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> during the processing. It serves as an endpoint detection device to send control signals back to the controller unit to indicate change of vacuum status and readiness for process continuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A vent valve <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> is provided to permit the introduction of a backfill gas to purge the system at the end of the activation operation. The valve is activated in response to a control signal <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, which issues from the plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the use of a venting gas. However, it is understood that in other embodiment of the invention any of a variety of gases can be used. Argon, helium, and oxygen are common examples. As noted, N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may also be used in some applications. Moreover, the venting gas might be the same species as that used to produce the plasma. In another embodiment, the vent gas could be introduced into the chamber through the same gas fittings as the source gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, a high level flow chart illustrating a plasma activation procedure in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is shown. As discussed above, a user may interact with the system via the remote control front end <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to the plasma activation system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> First, the substrates for bonding are loaded into the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the invention, a user manually loads a substrate to be bonded into the work chamber and onto the lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment of the invention, the work chamber is configured to accommodate the two substrates to be bonded so that both substrate surfaces are treated at the same time. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the work chamber is incorporated in an automated system. Thus, referring for a moment to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> an automated system comprises a materials handling unit <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> operatively coupled with a substrate cassette subsystem <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> containing substrates (e.g., wafers) to be bonded.. The robotic and substrate cassettes are cooperatively coupled with the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to deliver and retrieve substrates to and from the work chamber. The robotic and substrate cassettes may be loadlocked to the work chamber to form an airtight closed system. Alternatively, the substrate cassettes may be maintained in a chamber at atmospheric conditions. In other embodiments the two substrates can be pre-positioned (aligned) relative to one another in a fixture or jig and then placed into the plasma chamber for aligned activation and bonding operations. Supported parts can also be loaded and activated in the chamber via patterned support mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, after loading the substrates into the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> activates the vent valve <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> to close the valve, step <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Also, in step <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, the roughing valve <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> is activated to couple the roughing pump <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> to the work chamber. The interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is then evacuated to create a vacuum. The work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is monitored in step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> during the evacuation step until the pressure in the interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> reaches a first set point. In a particular embodiment of the invention the set point is optimized for the specific application and substrate combination. Next, in step <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> the plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> signals the MFC valve <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> to open in order to initiate a flow of O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas into the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In a particular embodiment of the invention, a delay of about 10 seconds (or less) or up to and over one minute is made, after which time the plasma activation controller turns on the first RF generator <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Here, the delay is used to stabilize the gas before ignition. The ramp rate to full power feature of the Advanced Energy RF generators allows the source power supply to reach full power and match conditions before the bias power supply achieves its matching point. Both matches are turned on simultaneously (or offset by a predetermined delta) but the source reaches full power and stabilizes before the bias source. The entire system is stabilized in less than 1 second. The variable ramp to power rate prevents adverse effects from the RF feedback between the two power supplies before equilibrium is established. The resulting source RF signal is applied to the electrically conductive upper platen member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In a specific embodiment, the controller sends a signal to turn on the second RF generator <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> at a predetermined time after turning on the first RF generator <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The resulting bias RF signal is applied to the electrically conductive lower platen member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas is ignited to produce an O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma within the interior chamber <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The substrate surface(s) is exposed to the resulting plasma for a few seconds (e.g., 5-30 seconds) to repeated exposures of a predetermined time (e.g., 5-15 seconds), after which time the RF generators are turned off in step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, thus extinguishing the plasma. Preferably, the bias RF generator <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is turned off at the same time as the source RF generator <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Doing so avoids the possibility of &ldquo;fluttering&rdquo; the residual plasma due to signal from the bias RF generator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It was discovered that bond strengths greater than those provided by conventional techniques could be achieved by a plasma activation treatment of a substrate surface where the substrate potential is time varying. Also, the etching effects of a plasma on a substrate surface can be avoided by the use of low RF frequencies and control of RF power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Further in accordance with the invention, the frequencies of the signals produced by the RF generators <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> preferably are non-integral multiples of each other. This ensures that there is no interaction between the source RF signal and the bias RF signal, such as resonance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Still further in accordance with the invention, the separation of the upper platen member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from the surface of the substrate to be treated by plasma activation is another consideration. If the upper platen is too close to the substrate surface being activated, the plasma reaching the surface will have a high energy and thus will cause etching of the surface. On the other hand, if the upper platen member is too far from the substrate surface, the plasma will have insufficient energy to be effective in activating the surface. It is also true that for large platen separation distances the ratio of neutrals, to charged species is not optimized. In order to achieve saturation of the surface with radicals it is necessary to optimize this spacing. A rough estimate of the separation can be predicted by the debye length of the ions but final configurations are empirically determined through process optimization. A typical range for a 200 mm wafer tool is &frac14;&Prime; to 1&Prime;. However, a chamber which is a few inches greater in diameter is provided for platen separation distances of 1.5&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A substrate surface whose surface has been treated by plasma activation according to the present invention bonds exceptionally well to the surface of a second substrate. Treating both surfaces to be bonded results in an exceptionally strong bond. Moreover, the treated surface(s) is substantially free of the etching effects associated with conventional plasma etching systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the source RF signal is a low frequency signal. This produces a plasma having low energy charged radicals (particles). By providing an additional lower frequency RF bias on the substrate, the charged radicals created by the source RF signal are drawn to the substrate surface without etching the surface. Thus, the surface is &ldquo;activated&rdquo; by the presence of these charged radicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As a result, a plasma exposure of a substrate surface made in accordance with the invention leaves charged radicals on the surface. These charged radicals have a very high free energy. Consequently, the radicals are very willing to bond with other elements in the substrate to lower its free energy state. Thus, when two such treated surfaces are brought together, a chemical bonding occurs resulting in a large free energy drop and development of a strong bond. A similar result is observed even if only one of the substrate surfaces is treated. The high free energy is also the source of the accelerated kinetic behavior of the bond strength development during post activation thermal treatments. The free energy provides the driving force for the transition from van der Waals bonding to covalent or ionic bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The bonding apparatus and technique of the present invention is especially well suited for semiconductor processing, and related applications in the semiconductor electronics industry. Other uses for substrate bonding include MEMS fabrication and packaging, polymer treated substrates or polymer substrates, ceramic packaging, laminated electronics, dual gate and flip chip bonding and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment of the invention, at least two substrates are placed in the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and simultaneously treated with the plasma. Then, the two substrates are manipulated so that the two treated surfaces are brought into contact to form an intimate contact between the two treated surfaces. This process can occur after the plasma has been extinguished or with the plasma still alight. During the activation multiple plasma can be used. It is sometimes advantageous to use a reducing atmosphere plasma to &ldquo;clean&rdquo; the surface or surfaces and then ignite a second plasma gas to activate the newly cleaned surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In another particular embodiment of the invention, a first substrate and a second substrate are simultaneously exposed to a plasma in the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, thereby effecting a plasma treatment of their respective surfaces. With the plasma still turned on, the plasma treated surface of the first substrate and the plasma treated surface of the second substrate are brought into contact. Subsequent to the bonding of the two substrates and after the plasma has been extinguished, the plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> signals the MFC valve <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> to block the fluid path between the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>source <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, thus shutting off the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>source to the work chamber. In addition, the vent valve <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> is activated to allow a flow of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas to enter the work chamber to purge the system with a backfill of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Alternatively, other gases such as O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the like can be used as the backfill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In yet another particular embodiment, a first substrate is placed in the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and then plasma treated. The first substrate is then placed in a holding area. The holding area is preferably contains substantially no free particles to compromise the activated surface of the first substrate. A second substrate is then placed in the work chamber and then plasma treated. The two substrates are then manipulated such that the treated surface of the first substrate and the treated surface of the second substrate are contacted to produce a bonded substrate pair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In situ (both parts inside the plasma chamber) bonding can be performed under vacuum or the work chamber can be backfilled with a gas to be trapped at the bond interface. This method is particularly applicable to MEMS device fabrication when gas filled cavities must be hermetically sealed at a regulated pressure (accelerometers e.g.) Thus in an alternative embodiment of the invention, the two treated surfaces can be joined during an additional inert gas purge to a desired pressure set point. In some cases the inert gas may be the same as the source gas. For example, pressure sensors are often bonded under the presence of an inert gas so that the sensing cavity and membrane are calibrated for a specific thermal expansion coefficient for a given inert gas ambient in the sealed cavity. Similarly, chemical sensors are often packaged (bonded) with a reactive gas trapped inside. Other materials such as medicine, liquids, ink, and the like fluids can also be sealed during the bonding process. That is not the function of step <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is monitored during the backfill step to detect when the pressure of the interior chamber has reached a second set point. When the second set point pressure has been reached, a signal is issued to alert the user that the bonding operation has completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In general, the bonding of two surface treated substrates might be made any time after the surfaces have been exposed to the plasma for a sufficient period of time, and before the backfill operation has completed. Once the substrate surfaces have been joined, a mechanical level might be drawn across the backside of one of the joined substrates to apply pressure to enhance the bonding action, or to initiate the bonding action if bonding had not spontaneously initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> also shows a manual mode of operation. In step <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, a test is made to determine whether a user initiated signal <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has specified a manual start of the process. If so, then plasma activation controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> issues signals to close the vent valve <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and open the roughing valve <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, to begin evacuating the work chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>. The plasma activation controller then releases control to the user. The activation signals <highlight><bold>381</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> are produced in response to receiving user control signals <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, another embodiment of the invention is shown. Rather than producing bonded substrates, the automated system shown in the figure might be used to produce standalone surface treated substrates <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>. The surfaces of the standalone substrates are highly reactive and are readily willing to bond to most chemical species. The standalone substrates are therefore well suited for collecting specimens in a geological expedition, a biological survey, or even in an extraterrestrial environment, such as a lunar expedition or planetary expedition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The packaging <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> for the standalone substrates <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> is preferably at least an airtight containment package in order to preserve the highly activated surface of the standalone substrate until is ready for use in the field. </paragraph>
