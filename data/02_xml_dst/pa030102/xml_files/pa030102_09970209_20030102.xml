<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the field of data storage devices, and more particularly but not by way of limitation to an apparatus and associated method for protecting stored data by early detection of undesired contact of a read/write head with a respective data storage surface. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Modern data storage devices such as disc drives are commonly used in a multitude of computer environments to store large amounts of data in a form that is readily available to a user. Generally, a disc drive has a magnetic disc, or two or more stacked magnetic discs, that are rotated by a motor at high speeds. Each disc has a data storage surface divided into a series of generally concentric data tracks where data is stored in the form of magnetic flux transitions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A data transfer member such as a magnetic transducer is moved by an actuator to selected positions adjacent the data storage surface to sense the magnetic flux transitions in reading data from the disc, and to transmit electrical signals to induce the magnetic flux transitions in writing data to the disc. The active elements of the data transfer member are supported by suspension structures extending from the actuator. The active elements are maintained a small distance above the data storage surface as the data transfer member flies upon an air bearing generated by air currents caused by the spinning discs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A continuing trend in the industry is toward ever-increasing data storage capacity and processing speed while maintaining or reducing the physical size of the disc drive. Consequently, the data transfer member and supporting structures are continually being miniaturized, data storage densities are continually being increased, and data transfer member fly heights are continually being decreased. The result is an overall increased sensitivity to vibration and surface anomalies which can cause the data transfer member to contact the data storage surface. Such contacts can have an adverse effect on the data storage and retrieval capability of the disc drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has been determined that by strategically placing a tuned acoustic emissions sensor on the device supporting the data transfer member that intermittent contacts can be detected and used to signal preventive measures to maximize the likelihood that stored data is preserved. It has further been determined that by employing two or more such tuned sensors that the location of the contacts can be identified in a disc stack so that the preventive measures can be limited to only where they are needed. It is to these improvements and others as exemplified by the description and appended claims that embodiments of the present invention are directed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a contact detector for detecting contact between a read/write device and a data storage media during data reading and writing operations therebetween in a data storage device. The read/write device is supported upon a moveable support member responsive to a control system for moving the read/write device to selected positions adjacent the data storage media. The data storage media is supported by a motor responsive to the control system for spinning the data storage media to generate air currents that operatively lift and support the read/write device in spatial disposition from the data storage media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The contact detector comprises a receiver circuit comprising a sensor tuned to a selected frequency associated with the data storage device. Acoustic emissions within the selected frequency indicate instances of the read/write device making contacting engagement with the data storage media. The contact detector furthermore comprises a control circuit responsive to the receiver circuit for adaptively controlling the data reading and writing operations of the read/write device and motor to protect stored data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the contact detector has a selected frequency comprising a frequency associated with a resonance frequency of the data storage device, such as the resonant frequency of the slider portion of the read/write head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the receiver circuit comprises a sensor connected to a unitary portion of a supporting structure and is thereby substantially equally responsive to acoustic emissions propagating from any of a plurality of the heads. Alternatively, the receiver circuit comprises two or more sensors connected to individual supporting arms associated with respective heads, which are thereby substantially more receptive of acoustic emissions propagating from the head supported by the respective arm. Where the receiver circuit comprises two or more sensors, a differential amplitude signal from the sensors can indicate which sensor is closer to the head making contact. With such pinpointing determination of the location of the head contact, data protection measures such as back-up reading operations can be limited to the head or heads making contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another aspect the embodiments of the present invention contemplate a method for detecting contacting engagement between a read/write device and an associated data storage media in a data storage device. The method comprises a step of providing a receiver circuit comprising an acoustic emission sensor tuned to detect a selected frequency and responsively provide a signal indicating the contacting engagement. The method further comprises the step of supporting the sensor on a support member that also supports the read/write device. The method further comprises the step of monitoring the sensor to detect acoustic emissions at the selected frequency. The method further comprises the step of initiating data protection measures in response to receiving the signal from the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another aspect the embodiments of the present invention contemplate a disc drive, comprising a read/write device in an operative data reading and writing relationship with a spinning data storage disc, and means for protecting stored data by invoking data protection measures in response to detecting acoustic emissions indicative of intermittent contact between the read/write device and the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These and various other features as well as advantages which characterize the present invention will be apparent upon reading of the following detailed description and review of the associated drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings in general, and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, shown therein is a plan representation of a data storage disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to which various disc drive components are mounted, and a cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (partially cut-away) which together with the base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a perimeter gasket <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> form an enclosure providing a sealed internal environment for the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Numerous details of construction are not included in the following description because they are well known to a skilled artisan and are unnecessary for an understanding of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Mounted to the base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to which one or more discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are stacked and secured by a clamp ring <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for rotation at a high speed in direction <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Where a plurality of discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are stacked to form a disc stack, adjacent discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are typically separated by a disc spacer (not shown). An actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> pivots around a pivot bearing <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> in a plane parallel to the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has actuator arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (only one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) that support load arms <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> in travel across the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as the actuator arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> move within the spaces between adjacent discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The load arms <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (or &ldquo;flexures&rdquo;) are flex members that support data transfer members, such as read/write heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;heads&rdquo;), with each of the heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> operatively interfacing one of the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in a data reading and writing relationship. This relationship is maintained by a slider (see below) having an aerodynamic surface which operably supports the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> on an air bearing sustained by air currents generated by the spinning discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Data read and write signals are transmitted from the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to a preamplifier <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> by electrical traces (not shown) extending along the actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each of the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> has a data storage region comprising a data storage surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> divided into concentric circular data tracks (not shown). Each of the heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent a desired data track to read data from or write data to the data track. The data storage surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be bounded inwardly by a circular landing zone <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> where the heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can come to rest against the respective discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at times when the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are not spinning. Alternatively, the landing zone can be located elsewhere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is positioned by a voice coil motor (VCM) <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> comprising an electrical coil <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a magnetic circuit source. The magnetic circuit source conventionally comprises one or more magnets supported by magnetic poles to complete the magnetic circuit. When controlled current is passed through the actuator coil <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, an electromagnetic field is set up which interacts with the magnetic circuit causing the actuator coil <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to move. As the actuator coil <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> moves, the actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> pivots around the pivot bearing <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, causing the heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to travel across the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> spins the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at a high speed as the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> reads data from and writes data to the data storage surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The kinetic energy of the spinning discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> transfers through the boundary layer at the disc/air interface, thereby inducing a rotational force component to air currents, and centrifugal force imparts a radial force component to air currents, creating a generally outwardly spiraling airstream. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic elevational view of one of the read/write heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> flying spatially disposed from the data storage surface <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> upon a portion of the air currents <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that engage against an air bearing surface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;slider&rdquo;) of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The aerodynamic characteristics of the slider <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the velocity of the spinning discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are some of the factors considered in order to operatively fly the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in a desired spatial disposition from the data storage surface, separated therefrom by a desired gap <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a view similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> but showing the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contacting an anomaly <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in the gap <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. The anomaly can be a portion of the data storage media that accumulated or was created by a previous contacting engagement during manufacturing or operation. The anomaly can also be debris such as a dust particle or a smudge. The contact shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is characteristic of the type referred to commonly as an intermittent contact; that is, in and of itself likely not a failure condition because the damage to the data storage media, if any, is likely localized to the anomaly. These intermittent contacts are difficult to detect, because they are not generally associated with measureable deflections or oscillations of the read/write head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> relative to the gap <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Left unchecked, however, the intermittent contacts can progressively worsen, especially if head slaps result as the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> continues to be deflected upwardly from a contact and back downwardly by the flexure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Embodiments of the present invention provide early detection of these intermittent contacts to prevent them from progressively resulting in a head crash. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The contacting engagement such as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> creates high frequency acoustic waves that propagate within the physical lattice of the structural material. In this case, the acoustic waves propagate within the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the supporting actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, including the flexure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the actuator arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. These acoustic waves are of a relatively high frequency, beyond the capability of an accelerometer sensing device. Typically, the frequencies are within the range of 1 to 2 Mhz, which are detectable by a piezoelectric (&ldquo;pzt&rdquo;) sensing device. Embodiments of the present invention comprise a contact detector comprising a receiver circuit and a control circuit responsive to the receiver circuit for adaptively controlling the data reading and writing operations of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to protect stored data in the event of intermittent contact. The receiver circuit in one embodiment comprises a pzt sensor employed as an acoustic emissions (AE) sensor that is tuned to a frequency associated with operations of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> operably coupled to a host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The functional circuits are grouped to illustrate the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprising a head disc assembly (HDA) <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> which generally comprises the mechanical components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A contact detector is represented generally by reference number <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The contact detector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> has control processor <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> providing top level control of the operation of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Programming and information utilized by the control processor <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> are provided in memory device <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, including a dynamic random access member (DRAM) device and a flash member device. The memory device structure can vary depending upon the requirements of a particular application of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An interface circuit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> includes a data buffer and a sequencer for directing the operation of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during data transfer operations. Generally, during a data write operation a read/write channel <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> encodes data to be written to the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> with run-length limited (RLL) and error correction codes (ECC) and write currents corresponding to the encoded data are applied by the preamp driver circuit <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to the read/write head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in order to selectively magnetize the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. During a data read operation, the preamp driver circuit <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> applies a read bias current to the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and monitors the voltage across a magneto-resistive (MR) element of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which varies according to the selective magnetization of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The voltage is preamplified by the preamp driver circuit <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to provide a read signal to the read/write channel <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> which decodes the stored data and provides the same to the buffer of the interface circuit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, for subsequent transfer to the host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A servo circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> controls the position of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through servo information read by the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and provided to the servo circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> by way of the preamp driver <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The servo information indicates the relative position of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with respect to a selected track on the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In response to the servo information, a digital signal processor controls the application of the current to the coil <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in order to adjust the position of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to a desired location. A spindle circuit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> controls the rotation of the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> through back electromagnetic force (bemf) commutation of the spindle motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is integrated into a control circuit <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) which comprises at least portions of the servo circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the spindle circuit <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, to detect intermittent contacts of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and to responsively control the data reading and writing operations to protect stored data. Generally, the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> comprises a pzt sensor outputting an analog acoustic emissions measurement on signal path <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to a driver circuit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which amplifies the acoustic emissions signal and provides the same on signal path <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to an analog to digital (A/D) converter <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> operably coupled to the control processor <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> by signal path <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, so that the control processor <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> has access to a digital representation of the acoustic emissions signal provided by the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can be arranged to detect a head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contact event generally, or can be arranged to alternatively pinpoint the location of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contact event. Turning briefly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> which is an isometric illustration of a portion of the actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> comprises a unitary body portion <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> interposed between the coil <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> extending oppositely therefrom. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are interleaved with the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to position the read/write heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contact events between a particular head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> creates high frequency acoustic emissions within the respective supporting flexure <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Because all the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are unitarily joined to the body <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the acoustic emissions generated by contact of any of the plurality of heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> propagate within the body <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> diagrammatically illustrates a portion of a receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) comprising a pzt sensor <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> attached to the upstanding portion of the body <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> between adjacent arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the sensor <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> will detect acoustic emissions of a selected frequency propagating within the body <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> from any of the plurality of heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> can be attached at other locations on the body <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in equivalent alternative embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The pzt sensor is customized to resonate at a selected frequency associated with the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, a particular disc drive can be observed to have a slider resonance of 2 Mhz. It has been determined that a pzt wafer can be produced with a 2 Mhz resonance at about 0.035 inches thick, and can be adaptively sized to fit on the actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in a manner described above. By tuning the pzt sensor to a particular resonant frequency, and matching that particular frequency with a resonant frequency of the slider <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, then spurious frequencies are of negligible effect on the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, complex filtering of the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> output is unnecessary, unlike the use of a sensor receptive to a frequency range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a view similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> but wherein the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> comprises two sensors <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> attached to individual arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and thereby substantially more receptive of acoustic emissions generated from contact of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> depending from the respective arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> diagrammatically shows the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> comprising a comparator circuit <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> for indicating which, if any, of a plurality of sensors <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> are resonating at the selected frequency, and comparing the relative signal amplitude from the sensors <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. By monitoring a differential amplitude of the AE signals from the sensors <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, information about the location of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> making contact can be discerned. To pinpoint the location of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contact even more, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment wherein the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> comprises a sensor on each of the plurality of arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. By knowing which head(s) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are making contact preventive measures such as backing up stored data can be limited to only the head(s) which are indicating contact has been made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the embodiments of the present invention comprises a method for detecting contacting engagement between a read/write device and an associated data storage media in a data storage device. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention beginning at block <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> a frequency is selected for indicating a head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contact. As discussed above, in one embodiment it is advantageous to determine and select the resonance frequency of the slider <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> so as to effectively rule out spurious frequencies. At block <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> one or more pzt(s) are provided that are tuned to resonate at the selected frequency from block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. At block <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> the pzt(s) are connected to the actuator in a desired arrangement to provide the corresponding receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> output. For example, in one embodiment one pzt can be connected to the body <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> so as to be substantially equally receptive to acoustic emissions from any of the heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> making contact. Alternatively, the pzt(s) can be connected to one or more arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the actuator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> so as to be substantially more receptive to acoustic emissions from the respective head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> supported by that particular arm <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Where two or more pzts are arranged in such a manner a differential amplitude signal can be monitored to determine which of the pzts are closer to the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> making contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> the control processor <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) issues commands upon start-up and operation of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to monitor the output signal <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> from the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> comprising the pzts selected and arranged in accordance with blocks <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In decision block <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> the control processor <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> initiates data protection measures in block <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> upon detecting a signal from the receiver circuit <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> that a head contact <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The data protection measures in block <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> can range from marking and recording the instances of a head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contact to backing up data and shutting down the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to prevent an imminent head crash. These more stringent latter protective measures can be implemented upon accumulation of a selected number of head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contacts to reduce the occasion of nuisance warnings or shut downs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In summary, a contact detector (such as <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>) monitors the instances of intermittent read/write head (such as <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) contacts to preventatively take data protection measures in a data storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The contact detector comprises a receiver circuit (such as <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>) including one or more piezoelectric sensors (such as <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>) that are tuned to be receptive to a selected frequency of acoustic emissions. Preferably, the selected frequency is associated with an operating characteristic of the data storage device, such as the resonant frequency of the slider (such as <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>) portion of the head to eliminate effects of spurious frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The sensors are connected to a supporting structure such as an actuator (such as <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). The sensors can be arranged on a unitary portion of the supporting structure (such as <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>) to be substantially equally receptive to acoustic emissions from all of the heads, or can be arranged on individual supporting arms (such as <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>) to be substantially more receptive to acoustic emissions from the head supported by the particular arm. Where two or more sensors are connected to the supporting structure, a differential amplitude signal can be monitored to determine which of the sensors is closer to the head making contact, thus pinpointing the problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The contact detector furthermore comprises a control circuit (such as <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>) in the form of an application specific integrated circuit that is responsive to the receiver circuit for adaptively controlling the data reading and writing operations of the head and spindle motor to protect stored data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of various embodiments of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments of the invention, this disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of structure and arrangement of parts within the principles of the present invention to the fall extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. For example, the selected frequency at which to tune the receiver circuit may vary while maintaining substantially the same functionality without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. In addition, although the preferred embodiment described herein is directed to a data storage device, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the teachings of the present invention can be applied to other systems, like data storage test or certification systems, servo track writers, or optical data storage systems, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
