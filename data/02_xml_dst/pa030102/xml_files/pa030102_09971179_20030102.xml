<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system for uniquely identifying each one of two or more intravenous (IV) lines that may be simultaneously employed to deliver drugs intravenously to one or more patients respectively from two or more containers (such as IV bags or bottles). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are medical situations, such as emergency rooms, trauma centers, and wards, in which two or more patients are simultaneously receiving IV drugs. Also, a single hospital patient often requires the administration of multiple IV drugs delivered separately, but simultaneously, through two or more separate IV sets, at widely different dosage rates. In such situations, it is necessary to assure that each container of drug solution is properly matched to the correct IV line and from there to the correct patient. Confusion in matching these elements must be avoided to assure that each drug is administered in the proper dosage to the proper patient, lest a patient be injured through the administration of the wrong drug or an improper dose of the correct drug. Additionally, there have been numerous instances of contraindicated medications being introduced into an IV line at a &ldquo;Y-site&rdquo; or an in-line port, with possible endangerment of the patient. To date, efforts to avoid such confusion have largely been ad hoc. For example, medical personnel may attach numbered pieces of adhesive tape to IV containers and to IV lines to match them up properly. Still, a more reliable mechanism has been sought to achieve these ends. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Broadly, the present invention is a system for identifying IV administration set components, wherein the IV set includes an IV solution container, a drip chamber having a hollow spike for introduction into the container, and an IV line for delivering the IV solution to a patient, wherein the system comprises a first identification element that is removably attached to the drip chamber for subsequent attachment to the container; a second identification element permanently affixed to the drip chamber; and a third identification element attached to a Y-site or port in the IV line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a specific preferred embodiment, the first identification element is a strip or patch that is adhesively attached to the drip chamber in a manner that will allow it to be removed therefrom for subsequent attachment to the IV solution container. The second identification element is a marker, preferably a strip or a patch, that is permanently affixed to the drip chamber. The third identification element is attached to a Y-site or port that is part of the IV line. The third identification element may be an integral part of the Y-site or port, or it may be removably attached to it. The first, second, and third identification elements bear matching identification symbols. In the context of this invention, the term &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; is deemed to encompass one or more letters, numbers, geometric shapes, abstract shapes, colors, and any combination of these elements. The term &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; may also include a color alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Viewed another way, the system of the invention comprises a matched set of plural identification elements bearing matching identification symbols, wherein a first one of the set is attachable to the IV container; a second one of the set is attached to the drip chamber; and a third one of the set is attached to the IV line remote from the first and second identification elements in the set. In practice, the system will advantageously include two or more such matched sets of identification elements, each set bearing a unique identification symbol. In the context of this invention, however, the term &ldquo;system&rdquo; is meant to encompass one or more such matched sets of identification elements.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> typical IV administration set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown, comprising a flexible plastic bag <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> serving as a container or reservoir for an IV drug solution (not shown). The set <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a hollow needle or spike <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adapted to puncture the bag <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has an outlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that communicates with a first segment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a flexible IV line. The first IV line segment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has an outlet end that communicates with a first inlet branch <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a Y-shaped port or &ldquo;Y-site&rdquo; <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The Y-site <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is modified in accordance with the present invention, as will be described below. The Y-site <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may advantageously have a second inlet branch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> sealed by a puncturable septum <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The septum <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be punctured by the needle of a syringe (not shown), or opened by a Luer connector or other device (not shown), for the administration of a supplemental drug into the IV line through the second inlet branch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as is well known in the art. The Y-site <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has an outlet branch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that communicates with a second segment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the flexible IV line, which terminates in an IV needle (not shown) that is adapted for insertion into a vein of a patient (not shown). Preferably, the outlet branch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is aligned axially with the second inlet branch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, so as to form therewith a continuous tubular body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The identification system of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The system comprises a first identification element, in the form of a first adhesive patch or strip <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>); a second identification element, preferably in the form of a second adhesive strip or patch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>); and third identification element, in the form of a flattened extension <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that extends outwardly from the tubular body that comprises the second inlet branch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the outlet branch <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the Y-site <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and that is advantageously formed integrally therewith (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The first adhesive strip or patch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) includes a pull tab <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at one end and an adhesive backing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on its reverse side, but not on the back of the pull tab <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The first adhesive strip or patch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is initially adhesively attached to the drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in solid outline in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). When the identification system of the present invention is used, however, the first adhesive strip or patch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is removed from the drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by means of the pull tab <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and it is then adhesively applied to the exterior of the IV container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in broken outline in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The second adhesive strip or patch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also has an adhesive backing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) that allows it to be fixed to the drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The adhesive backing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is advantageously such as to fix the second strip or patch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> permanently to the drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as a permanent marker. Alternatively, the second identification element may simply be an identification symbol permanently marked on the drip chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The first adhesive strip or patch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the second adhesive strip or patch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the coupler extension <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are each marked with a matching identification symbol <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the symbol <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be a numeral. Preferably, color may be used as part of the identification symbols <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, whereby the symbols <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> have a matching color as well as a matching number. Still more preferably, the Y-site <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be made in the same color as the symbols <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In use, the identification system of the present invention will usually comprise two or more sets of identification elements, each set comprising a first strip or patch <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a second strip or patch <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a Y-site <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with an extension <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> bearing the same identification symbol <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, unique to that set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> show alternative forms of the identification system, using different types of identification symbols. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> the symbol <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; is a letter, preferably in combination with a matching color. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> the symbol <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&Prime; is a color alone, the matching color being the predominant (if not sole) color of both the tab <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the strip <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> the symbol <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; is a colored geometric shape. Still other types of symbols may be Roman numerals, abstract shapes and designs, and letters of non-Latin alphabets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative form of the third identification element. In this form, the coupler or Y-site <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is structurally an ordinary device of this type, lacking the extension <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> described above. The Y-site <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is marked with an identification symbol <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by means of a band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> attached around the inlet branch of the coupler <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> bearing the symbol <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The band <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is preferably applied as a segment of shrink tubing, but it may also be in the form of an adhesive strip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In use, the practitioner is provided with a drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to which the first identification element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is removably attached and the second identification element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is permanently fixed, and an IV line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a Y-site or port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that includes the third identification element <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. When an IV solution container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is selected, the drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the IV solution container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (by means of the hollow spike <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). The first identification element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is then removed from the drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and attached to the IV solution container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a high degree of certainty is provided that the IV solution container is matched to the proper IV line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 10</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> illustrate another modified form of the third identification element. In this form, the third identification element is in the form of an attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is removably attachable to a standard Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> having a first inlet branch <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second inlet branch <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises a sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with an axial slit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and an integral lateral extension <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that is marked with an identification symbol <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The integral extension <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is preferably located diametrically opposite the axial slit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and it is oriented substantially parallel to the slit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is made of a resilient, flexible, plastic material, and it is shaped and dimensioned to fit over and to conform to the exterior surface of the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can thus be slightly spread apart along the axial slit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to allow the second IV line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> downstream from the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to be passed through the slit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and then the attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is pushed upwardly from the lower (downstream) end of the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> until the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is received in the sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is widened at its upper (upstream) end to accommodate the first inlet branch <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the slit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is widened at its upper (upstream) end to accommodate the second inlet branch <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be removed by just reversing the aforementioned installation process. Alternatively, the attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be installed snapping the sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> directly onto the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by spreading the sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> apart along the slit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the sleeve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can be spread apart along the slit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for removal from the port or Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The method of using the modified form of the invention is the same as described above, except that the practitioner is provided with an IV line having a standard Y-site or port <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and an appropriate snap-on member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for attachment to the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. When an IV solution container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is selected, the drip chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to it, and the first identification element is removed from the drip chamber and applied to the solution container. The third identification element (attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) is then attached to the Y-site <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (as described above), the attachment <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having an identification symbol <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that matches the identification symbol on the first and second identification element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described herein, it will be appreciated that a number of variations and modifications will suggest themselves to those skilled in the pertinent arts. These variations and modifications are considered within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined in the claims that follow. </paragraph>
