<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view showing the structure of a conventional optical module. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the conventional optical module mainly includes a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> converting an electric signal to an optical signal, a thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> serving as temperature detection means, a mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mounting the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a thermoelectric cooling element <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for heating/cooling the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for controlling the temperature thereof, a driver IC (integrated circuit) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a feeder line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> storing these members, and a signal input connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> electrically connected to an electric signal input/output unit of the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The feeder line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is employed for electrically connecting the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the electric signal input/output unit of the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with each other. The driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is electrically connected between the feeder line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the electric signal input/output unit of the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for amplifying the electric signal input in the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference> are a perspective view and a sectional view schematically showing the structure of the feeder line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> respectively. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, the feeder line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a microstrip line prepared by forming conductor films <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> on an alumina ceramic substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> mainly composed of aluminum oxide. Each of the conductor films <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> consists of a multilayer structure including at least two layers, i.e., a lower conductor layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>actually fed with a high-frequency electric signal and a gold plating layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>necessary for soldering or wire bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A wavelength division multiplex transmission system is watched with interest as an application of such an optical module. This system, multiplexing a plurality of signals in an optical wavelength region and transmitting the same, readily increases the capacity of an optical communication system. Recently, a high-density wavelength division multiplex transmission system narrowing the multiplexed wavelength interval to 200 GHz or 100 GHz has been defined under international standards for attaining a higher capacity. The optical module must have a sufficiently stable wavelength (preferably not more than about {fraction (1/100)} the wavelength interval) with respect to this wavelength interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the optical module shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, heat flows into the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mounting the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> mainly through the aforementioned feeder line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the optical module is so controlled that the temperature detected by the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In practice, however, the portion provided with the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the portion provided with the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are different in thermal resistance from each other as viewed from the heat inflow path, to exhibit different temperatures, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. When the ambient temperature for the optical module changes, therefore, the temperature of the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> disadvantageously changes even if the temperature of the optical module is so controlled that the temperature detected by the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is regularly constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the descending solid line shows temperature distribution in the case where the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a higher temperature than the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while the ascending solid line shows temperature distribution in the case where the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a lower temperature than the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the thickness of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of alumina (thermal conductivity: 33 W/m/K) is 254 &mgr;m and the thickness of the conductor films <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of gold (thermal conductivity: 315 W/m/K) is 3 &mgr;m in the microstrip line shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, thermal conduction between the alumina part and the conductor parts is about 9:1 and a larger quantity of heat is transmitted through the alumina part. While thermal conductivity can be lowered by reducing the thickness of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> consisting of alumina, the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is readily cracked if the thickness thereof is reduced. Therefore, the thermal conductivity cannot be much reduced in practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Wires <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> define another heat inflow path, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. The wires <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected to the driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for amplifying the electric signal input in the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed on an electric circuit mounting unit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>A. When the electric signal is input in the connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the wires <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must be coupled to leads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>C arranged oppositely to the connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the wires <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are electrically connected to the leads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>C through wires <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>located on the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and conductor patterns <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>located on a lead mounting substrate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the conventional optical module, the wires <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are coupled to the leads <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>C located oppositely to the driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mounting the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and hence heat flows into the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the wires <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or other wires. When the ambient temperature for the optical module changes, therefore, the temperature of the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> disadvantageously changes although the temperature of the optical module is so controlled that the temperature detected by the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is regularly constant, similarly to the aforementioned case where heat flows into the optical module through the feeder line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Temperature dependency of the oscillation wavelength of the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is about 10 GHz/&deg; C., and hence the temperature thereof must be controlled with precision of not more than about 0.1&deg; C. within the category temperature range. Therefore, wavelength change of the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> caused by heat flowing into the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the feeder line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or the wires <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes into question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further, a conventional optical communication system performs no multiplexing in the wavelength region, and hence thermal design is simply based on whether or not the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be heated/cooled to a prescribed temperature in the category temperature range. Therefore, the aforementioned problem has been first clarified when the high-density wavelength division multiplex transmission system performing high-density multiplexing in the wavelength region has been watched with interest. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide an optical module capable of suppressing wavelength change of a semiconductor laser caused by inflow of heat in a high-density wavelength division multiplex optical transmission system multiplexing a plurality of signals in an optical wavelength region in high density and transmitting the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The optical module according to the present invention comprises a package, an optical device, a mounting unit and a feeder line. The package has an electric signal input/output unit. The optical device is arranged in the package. The mounting unit mounts the optical device. The feeder line is employed for electrical connection between the optical device and the electric signal input/output unit, and includes a dielectric substrate having thermal conductivity smaller than the thermal conductivity of aluminum oxide and a conductor film formed on the dielectric substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the optical module according to the present invention, the thermal conductivity of the dielectric substrate employed in the feeder line is smaller than the thermal conductivity of aluminum oxide. Thus, heat can be inhibited from flowing into the optical device through the feeder line as compared with a conventional feeder line employing a dielectric substrate of aluminum oxide. Therefore, a semiconductor laser can be inhibited from wavelength change caused by heat flowing into the same also in a high-density wavelength division multiplex transmission system multiplexing a plurality of signals in an optical wavelength region in high density and transmitting the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned optical module, the thermal conductivity of the dielectric substrate is preferably not more than 3 W/m/K. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thus, the thermal conductivity can be remarkably reduced as compared with the thermal conductivity (33 W/m/K) of alumina employed for a conventional dielectric substrate. Therefore, heat can be further inhibited from flowing into the optical device through the feeder line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned optical module preferably further comprises a thermoelectric cooling element for controlling the temperature of the mounting unit and a temperature detection element mounted on the mounting unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, heat can be inhibited from flowing into the optical device through the feeder line as hereinabove described, whereby the temperature of the optical device can be kept constant by controlling the temperature of the mounting unit with the thermoelectric cooling element in response to the temperature detected by the temperature detection element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned optical module, the material of the dielectric substrate is preferably glass ceramic containing silicon dioxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Thus, thermal conductivity lower than that of aluminum oxide, particularly thermal conductivity of not more than 3 W/m/K can be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned optical module, the line width of the conductor film in a portion not in contact with the package and the mounting unit is preferably smaller than the width of the dielectric substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Thus, heat can be inhibited also from flowing into the optical device through the conductor film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned optical module, the conductor film for signal transmission is preferably formed only on one of a pair of opposite surfaces of the dielectric substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Thus, heat can be inhibited from flowing into the optical device through the conductor film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned optical module, the feeder line is preferably either a coplanar line or a slot line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thus, the feeder line can be properly prepared from any line in response to the application thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned optical module, the conductor film preferably has a first terminal portion for electrical connection with the optical device, a second terminal portion for electrical connection with the electric signal input/output unit and a connection portion connecting the first and second terminal portions with each other. The connection portion consists of a material having smaller thermal conductivity than that of gold, and the first and second terminal portions consist of gold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When the connection par is prepared from a material having smaller thermal conductivity than gold, heat can be inhibited from flowing into the optical device through the conductor film while soldering or bonding of wires or ribbons is enabled on the first and second terminal portions . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned optical module, the conductor film preferably has a first terminal portion for electrical connection with the optical device, a second terminal portion for electrical connection with the electric signal input/output unit and a connection portion connecting the first and second terminal portions with each other. Each of the first terminal portion, the second terminal portion and the connection portion have first layer consisting of a material including at least one element selected from a group consisting of nickel, platinum, palladium, tungsten, molybdenum and copper. Each of the first and second terminal portions have second layer consisting of gold formed on the first layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Thus, heat can be inhibited from flowing into the optical device through the conductor film, and soldering or bonding of wires or ribbons is enabled on the first and second terminal portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned optical module preferably further comprises an electric circuit for amplifying an electric signal input in the optical device, an electric circuit mounting unit mounting the electric circuit and a wire formed on the electric circuit mounting unit and electrically connected to the electric circuit. The wire is electrically connected to a lead located outside the package without through the mounting unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Thus, heat can be prevented from flowing into the optical device through the wire electrically connected to the electric circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned optical module preferably further comprises a lead mounting substrate mounted on the package and having a conductor pattern for electrical connection to the lead. The lead mounting substrate has an extension part extending toward the electric circuit mounting unit. The conductor pattern extends onto the extension part to be electrically connected to the wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Thus, heat can be prevented from flowing into the optical device through the wire electrically connected to the electric circuit, while the conductor pattern and the wire can be electrically connected with each other without requiring a specific member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an optical module according to a first embodiment of the present invention mainly includes a feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a signal input connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> converts an electric signal to an optical signal, and the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mounts the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> stores the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> therein, and the signal input connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected to an electric signal input/output unit of the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is employed for electrically connecting the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the electric signal input/output unit of the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with each other. The driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is electrically connected between the feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the signal input connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for amplifying the electric signal input in the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a microstrip line prepared by forming conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on a dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has smaller thermal conductivity than aluminum oxide (alumina). Each of the conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> consists of a multilayer structure including at least two layers, i.e., a lower conductor layer actually fed with a high-frequency electric signal and a gold plating layer necessary for soldering or wire bonding, similarly to the prior art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate the conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as single layers, for convenience of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is prepared from a material having smaller thermal conductivity than alumina employed in the prior art, whereby thermal conduction can be reduced as compared with the prior art employing alumina. Therefore, heat can be inhibited from flowing into the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The performance of the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is reduced as the temperature thereof is increased. According to this embodiment, however, heat is inhibited from flowing into the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is prevented from temperature increase as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, whereby the optical module can be used under a higher temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an optical module according to a second embodiment of the present invention mainly includes a feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a signal input connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a thermoelectric cooling element <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> converts an electric signal to an optical signal, and the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is temperature detection means for detecting the temperature around the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> packages the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the thermoelectric cooling element <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> heats/cools the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for controlling the temperature thereof The package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> stores these members therein, and the signal input connector <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected to an electric signal input/output unit of the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, electrically connecting the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the electric signal input/output unit of the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, is arranged in the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The driver IC <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is electrically connected between the feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the electric signal input/output unit of the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for amplifying the electric signal input in the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> employed in this embodiment is a microstrip line prepared by forming conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on a dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example. The dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is prepared from a material having thermal conductivity of not more than 3 W/m/K. Each of the conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> consists of a multilayer structure including at least two layers, i.e., a lower conductor layer actually fed with a high-frequency electric signal and a gold plating layer necessary for soldering or wire bonding, similarly to the prior art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as single layers, for convenience of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is prepared from the material having thermal conductivity of not more than 3 W/m/K, so that the thermal conductivity of the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be remarkably reduced as compared with the prior art employing alumina. Thus, heat can be remarkably inhibited from flowing into the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Thus, heat is remarkably inhibited from flowing into the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that temperature difference between the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the thermistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is reduced regardless of thermal resistance therebetween as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, whereby the optical module has a stable wavelength also when the ambient temperature for the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the descending solid line shows temperature distribution in the case where the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a higher temperature than the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while the ascending solid line shows temperature distribution in the case where the package <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a lower temperature than the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When the thermal conductivity of the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not more than 3 W/m/K, heat transmitted through the conductor parts of the feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is so dominant that wavelength conversion can be further suppressed by devising the constituents and the structure of the conductor parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> employed in an optical module according to a third embodiment of the present invention consists of glass ceramic containing silicon dioxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The remaining structure of the third embodiment is substantially identical to that of the aforementioned first or second embodiment, and hence redundant description is not repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consists of glass ceramic containing silicon dioxide. Therefore, the thermal conductivity as well as dielectric loss of the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be reduced. In particular, the thermal conductivity of the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be reduced below that of aluminum oxide (alumina) employed in the prior art, and can be further reduced to 3 W/m/K and below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When this feeder line <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is employed, therefore, heat can be remarkably inhibited from flowing into a mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that the optical module exhibits a stable wavelength and an excellent high-frequency characteristic also when the ambient temperature for a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of a material having small thermal conductivity, the conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> serve as principal heat conduction paths. According to this embodiment, the line widths W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are smaller than the width W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the dielectric substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, whereby the quantities of thermal conduction are reduced in the conductor films <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the quantity of heat flowing into the mounting unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> packaging a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is reduced so that the optical module exhibits a stable wavelength also when the ambient temperature changes. </paragraph>
