<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical drive loader with a manual disk ejecting mechanism, particularly to a CD player loader which offers a manual disk ejecting mechanism when the electronic controlled disk ejecting mechanism does not operate normally or fails to function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When compared with the conventional magnetic storage media, Compact disks possess the features that, firstly, compact disks are durable after written the image, music, or electronic data thereon; secondly, compact disks have a longer life than other conventional storage means because the date reading of compact disks is accomplished by lens optics rather than physical reading means used in prior art. Therefore, such optical storage medium has become popular in recent years. More and more compact disks are available in the market. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional designs of CD players, such as a VCD player, a DVD player and the like, the feeding/ejecting mechanism of a CD player can be categorized into two types, one is the tray-in type and the other is the slot-in type. The tray-in type uses a tray, which extends from and retracts back to the-CD player body. Users place a compact disk on the tray (or remove the CD from the tray) when the tray is in extended position. The tray holding the compact disk thereon is received in the CD player body after the tray retracts back. On the other hand, the slot-in type utilizes a disk clamping mechanism in a CD player body. Users insert the compact disks through an insertion slot installed in the housing of the CD player such that the disk clamping mechanism can clip the Compact disks, retract back to the CD player body and proceed to data reading or data reprocessing. When ejecting a disk, the disk clamping mechanism moves toward the insertion slot. The disk is ejected partially at the insertion slot so as to allow the users to remove the CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Both in the tray-in type and the slot-in type of feeding/ejecting mechanism, a CD player typically uses integrated circuit (IC) to control the servo-motor for driving the feeding/ejecting mechanism. The IC control operation is powered by electricity. In the absence of a manual disk ejecting mechanism, when the electronic control system does not operate normally or fails to function, the compact disks is held inside the CD player. The process to remove said compact disk involves with disassemble the CD player and cannot be done by a layperson. As a result, if users desire to use said compact disks, they have to seek professional help at a maintenance center. The process may be time consuming and impractical. On the other hand, if users choose to disassemble the CD player on their own, it may result in damage during disassembly and may cost more for the users to have the CD players repaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome the foregoing problems, i.e. a CD player can not eject the disk when the electronic control system does not operate normally or fails to function, some models are equipped with a manual disk ejecting mechanism. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> loader <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> installed in the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of a CD player is disclosed. Since the feeding/ejecting mechanism of the loader <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the emphasis of the present invention, those elements, such as the power supply apparatus, signal processing circuits, etc. are all received inside the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, not relating to the subject matter will not be described in detail hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The loader <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> mainly comprises a frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> slidingly coupled to the frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a speed reduction transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> installed on the frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for driving the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move, a driving motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> positioned on the frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for driving the speed reduction transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, wherein the speed reduction transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> comprises a first gear <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, a second gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> moved by the first gear <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, and a third gear <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> moved by the second gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> such that the third gear <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> can move a rack <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> correspondingly installed on the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. By means of the actuating gear <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> which is installed on the spindle of the driving motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for driving the first gear <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to rotate, the speed reduction of the speed reduction transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and the rack <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can transfer the rotation motion of the driving motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into a linear motion with a proper speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When operating normally, by means of an electronic control system, one can make the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to extend from and retract back to the frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> by controlling the rotation direction of the driving motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. For preventing the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from failing to move, which may be caused by the malfunction of the electronic control system, a sector gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> positioned on the frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a spring <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> for maintaining the sector gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at a fixed position are installed and a through hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is positioned on the front panel <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the electronic control system fails to activate the driving motor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to move the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, users can stick a slender rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> going through the through hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to move the sector gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> toward the third gear <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>. It follows that the gear end of the sector gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is enabled to move the third gear <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> to rotate a limited angle which is just enough to drive the rack <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and cause the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to extend from the frame <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> a proper length. Consequently, the disk is manually ejected, and users can pull out the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and pick up the disk on the tray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, one of the disadvantages of such a manual disk ejecting mechanism is that a through hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> needs to be disposed on the panel <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a slender rod <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to go through. However, such a through hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may affect the appearance of the entire operation panel <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>; moreover a spring <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> needs to be installed for maintaining the sector gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at a fixed position when operating normally so as not to affect the normal rotation of the third gear <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>. Such a design obviously needs additional construction parts so that the cost is increased and the assembly becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, another conventional design of a manual disk ejecting mechanism is disclosed. The operation is very similar to the one as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, despite the driving motor and the speed reduction transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are arranged differently on the frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In this conventional design, the speed reduction transmission mechanism <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises a first gear <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> driven by a driving motor, and a second gear <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> driven by the first gear <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> so as to move a slot-in type disk clamping apparatus <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As a result of the limited space on the frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the disposition of the entire construction, the manual disk ejecting mechanism is a screw rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> installed on one side of the frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for driving the first gear <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> to rotate. When the driving motor does not operate normally or fails to function, one can use a tool such as a screw driver to rotate the screw rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, drive the first gear <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and then make the disk clamping apparatus <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to eject the disk. However, such a design still has some disadvantages. One of the drawbacks is that the screw rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is installed on one side of the frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> inside the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Although there is no hole disposed on the operation panel of the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> so that the appearance is not be altered. When the manual disk ejecting is required, users need to disassemble the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> first because it does not allow the user to drive the screw rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> externally. Another drawback is that the gear ratio between the screw rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the first gear <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is so high that for rotating the first gear <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> with one turn, the screw rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> needs to be rotated with several turns. As a result, it is time-consuming when manually ejecting a disk, as the screw rod <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> needs to be rotated a great number of turns. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is installed in the housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and is shaped in accordance with the whole mechanism design. The disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be a slot-in type disk clamping apparatus or a tray-in type. In the preferred embodiment, it is a slot-in type disk clamping apparatus for holding and positioning a compact disk. The slot-in type disk clamping apparatus is slidingly coupled to the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> such that the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is movable between the feeding/ejecting position <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, which is close to the insertion slot <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a data reading position, which is far away from the insertion slot <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. A rack <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> is installed on the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> along the moving direction of the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A speed reduction apparatus <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is installed on the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for driving the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the speed reduction apparatus comprises at least a first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>, a second gear <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> which is engaged with the rack <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> of the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and driven by the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> is formed with a first circular gear portion <highlight><bold>5311</bold></highlight> on outer edge with more teeth and a second circular gear portion <highlight><bold>5312</bold></highlight> with less teeth which is coaxial with the first circular gear portion <highlight><bold>5311</bold></highlight> and extends outward. The first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> transmits the rotation motion to the second gear <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> by means of a first speed reduction gear <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> and a second speed reduction gear <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>, which is driven by the first speed reduction gear <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The driving apparatus <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is positioned on the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for supplying power to the speed reduction apparatus <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the driving apparatus <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a driving motor, which is used to drive the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> and then make the second gear <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> to drive the rack <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> of the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> such that the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can move linearly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The disk ejecting actuating part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is also positioned on the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment, the disk ejecting actuating part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is positioned under the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> for cooperating to the extending direction of the second circular gear portion <highlight><bold>5312</bold></highlight> of the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the disk ejecting actuating part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> comprises a gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> which drives the second circulation portion <highlight><bold>5312</bold></highlight> of the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>, and a roll stem portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> which positions at the center of the gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> and extrudes outward along the central axis. The roll stem portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> is positioned on the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and appeared under the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>., A proper slot <highlight><bold>5521</bold></highlight> is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which is a cross slot. A through hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is disposed on the housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> corresponding to the roll stem portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When operating normally, the rotation direction of the driving apparatus <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is controlled electronically as a conventional CD player is controlled. The rotation speed of the driving apparatus <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is reduced by means of the speed reduction apparatus <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The rotation motion is transferred to linear motion by the rack <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> of the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so as to move the Compact disks held on the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> forward and backward between the feeding/ejecting position and the data reading position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When the driving apparatus <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> does not operate normally or fails to function, users may stick a cross screw driver, a flat screw driver, or the like, going through the through hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to couple with the slot <highlight><bold>5521</bold></highlight> of the roll stem portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> and turning the roll stem portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> to rotate the gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>. The gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>, instead of the driving apparatus <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> drives the second circular gear portion <highlight><bold>5312</bold></highlight> of the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> to move the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the feeding/ejecting position. When the disk receiving apparatus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in feeding/ejecting position, the users then are allowed to remove the compact disk. As a result, without dismantling the housing <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a compact disk manual ejecting can be easily achieved. </paragraph>

Further more, the transmission proportion of rotation speed between the gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> of the disk ejecting actuating part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the second circular portion <highlight><bold>5312</bold></highlight> of the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> is minor. In other words, the present invention offers a power saving means for ejecting compact disks and avoids the extra labor required when using a screw rod to eject a disk in the prior art as a result of low the transmission rotation speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> When operating normally, in order to prevent the disk ejecting actuating part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the first gear <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> from being cogged which may generates transmission resistance of the speed reduction apparatus <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and noise. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> smooth toothless region <highlight><bold>5511</bold></highlight> is formed on the edge surface of the gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> of the disk ejecting actuating part <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. At a corresponding position on the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a positioning pair <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight> is disposed on the surface of the gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> facing the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the positioning pair <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight> comprises a bump <highlight><bold>5531</bold></highlight> and a corresponding shallow recession <highlight><bold>5532</bold></highlight>, the bump <highlight><bold>5531</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> and the shallow recession <highlight><bold>5532</bold></highlight> is formed on the frame <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. When the driving apparatus <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> operates normally, the bump <highlight><bold>5531</bold></highlight> is coupled to the shallow recession <highlight><bold>5532</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, to provide an interference force such that the gear portion <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> is rotated to a specific orientation to prevent the toothless portion <highlight><bold>5511</bold></highlight> and the second circular gear portion <highlight><bold>5312</bold></highlight> from being cogged. </paragraph>
