<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A thin-film multi-layer high Q transformer. To form an outer transformer winding a plurality of parallel first level metal runners are formed in a first insulating layer overlying the semiconductor substrate. A plurality of vertical conductive vias are formed in third and fourth insulating layers and in electrical communication with each end of the first level metal runners. A fourth insulating layer is disposed over the third insulating layer and additional vertical conductive vias and a fourth level metal runner are formed therein.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to transformers formed on an integrated circuit substrate, and more specifically to transformers having an outer core spanning at least three metal layers of the integrated circuit substrate. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The current revolution in wireless communications and the need for smaller wireless communications devices has spawned significant efforts directed to the optimization and miniaturization of radio communications electronics devices. Passive components of these devices (such as inductors, capacitors and transformers), play a necessary role in the devices&apos; operation and thus efforts are directed toward reducing the size and improving the fabrication efficiency of such components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Transformers, which play an integral role in the performance of electronic communications devices, are electromagnetic components comprising a primary and a secondary winding. Conventionally, the windings are wound on a common core, which forms a closed loop magnetic circuit. Iron cores are typical to enhance the transformer effect, but not required. Each winding comprises a plurality of turns. The relationship between the primary and secondary voltage is a function of the primary to secondary turns ratio, and the relationship between the primary and secondary current is an inverse function of the turns ratio. As is known, there are many different physical configurations for the transformer windings and core. In one embodiment, for example, the primary and secondary windings form a helical structure, with the secondary windings oriented within the opening formed by the primary windings. Transformers also serve in varied applications, including power applications for stepping applied voltages up or down and for impedance matching at frequencies from audio to radio frequency (RF). With the continual allocation of operational communications frequencies into higher frequency bands, transformers used in impedance-matching applications suffer impaired performance due to increased eddy current and skin effect losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The Q (or quality factor) is an important transformer figure of merit. The Q measures the ratio of inductive reactance to inductive resistance within the transformer windings. High Q transformers present a narrow peak when the transformer current is graphed as a function of the input signal frequency, with the peak representing the frequency at which the transformer resonates. High Q transformers are especially important for use in frequency-dependent circuits operating with narrow bandwidths. Because the Q value is an inverse function of transformer resistance, it is especially important to minimize the resistance to increase the Q. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Most personal communications devices incorporate integrated circuit active components fabricated using semiconductor technologies, such as silicon or gallium-arsenide. The prior art teaches certain integrated inductive structures (including torroidal or spiral shaped inductors) developed to achieve compatibility with the silicon-based integrated circuit fabrication processes. When two such inductors are proximately formed, the coupling of the magnetic field formed by current flow through one winding (the primary) into the winding area of the other winding (the secondary) results in transformer action and the flow of current in the secondary. However, such planar inductors tend to suffer from high losses and low Q factors at the operative frequencies of interest. These losses and low Q factors are generally attributable to dielectric losses caused by parasitic capacitances and resistive losses due to the use of thin and relatively high resistivity conductors in the transformer structure. Another disadvantage of conventional planar inductors and transformers formed from them is a result of the magnetic field lines (which are perpendicular to the semiconductor substrate surface) entering the semiconductor and dielectric layers above, beside and below the transformer. This increases the inductive losses and lowers the transformer&apos;s Q factor. Also, unless the transformer is located a significant distance from active circuit elements formed in the silicon, the magnetic field lines induce currents in and therefore disrupt operation of the active components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> With integrated circuit active devices growing smaller and operating at higher speeds, the interconnect system should not add processing delays to the device signals. Use of conventional aluminum interconnect metallization restricts circuit operational speed as the longer interconnects and smaller interconnect cross-sections increase the interconnect resistance. Also, the relatively small contact resistance between the aluminum and silicon surfaces creates a significant total resistance as the number of circuit components grows. It is also difficult to deposit aluminum with a high aspect ratio in vias and plugs, where the aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of plug thickness to diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Given theses disadvantages, copper is becoming the interconnect of choice because it is a better conductor than aluminum (with a resistance of 1.7 micro-ohm cm compared to 3.1 micro-ohm cm for aluminum), is less susceptible to electromigration, can be deposited at lower temperatures (thereby avoiding deleterious effects on the device dopant profiles) and is suitable for use as a plug material in a high aspect ration plug. Copper interconnects can be formed by chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, electroplating and electrolytic plating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The damascene process is one technique for forming active device copper interconnects. A trench is formed in a surface dielectric layer and the copper material is then deposited therein. Usually the trench is overfilled, requiring a chemical and mechanical polishing step to re-planarize the surface. This process offers superior dimensional control because it eliminates the dimensional variations introduced in a typical pattern and etch interconnect process. The dual damascene process extends the damascene process, simultaneously forming both the underlying conductive vias and the interconnecting trenches from copper. First the via opening is formed, followed by formation of a trench between two via openings to be interconnected. A subsequent metal deposition step fills both the via openings and the trench, forming an integral metal layer and conductive via to the metal layer below. A chemical and mechanical polishing step planarizes the top surface or the substrate. Dual damascene processes are discussed in detail in the following references, which are hereby incorporated by reference: C. K. Hu et. al., Proceedings MRS Symposium on VLSI, vol. 5, p. 369 (1990); B. Luther et. al. Proceedings VMIC, vol. 10, p. 15 (1994); D. Edelstein, Proceedings ECS Mtg., vol. 96-2, p. 335 (1996). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To provide further advances in the fabrication of transformers in conjunction with active devices on a semiconductor substrate, an architecture and processes is provided for forming such a transformer within the conventional metal layers of an integrated circuit, wherein the transformer core area is larger than prior art transformers, resulting in a higher inductance value and a higher Q figure of merit. Also, a transformer formed according to the teachings of the present inventions has a desirable low-resistance (and thus high Q) in a relatively compact area of the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the invention, a plurality of parallel lower conductive strips are formed overlying the semiconductor substrate, in which active components were previously formed. First and second vertical conductive via openings are formed over first and second opposing edges of each lower conductive strip and conductive material is deposited within the via openings to form first and second conductive vias. Two additional via openings are formed in vertical alignment with the first and the second conductive vias and filled with metal to form third and fourth conductive vias. A plurality of upper conductive strips are then formed, wherein the plane of an upper conductive strip intersects the plane of a lower conductive strip such that a first edge of one upper conductive strip overlies the first edge of a lower conductive strip, and the two edges are interconnected by the first and the third conductive vias. A second edge of the upper conductive strip overlies the second edge of the next parallel lower conductive strip, and these edges are electrically connected by the second and the fourth conductive vias. Thus is formed an outer helical winding of the transformer. An inner winding of the transformer is similarly formed. The bottom segment of the inner winding is formed at least one metal layer above the bottom segment of the outer winding, and the top segment of the inner winding is at least one metal layer below the top segment of the inner winding. Although the transformer must be formed in at least four metal layers (i.e., the bottom segment of the inner and windings and the top segment of the inner and outer windings), there can be more than one metal layer between the various winding segments and the bottom segment of the outer winding can be formed on any of the integrated circuit metal layers, with the additional winding segments formed above it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The use of certain layout and metallization techniques for constructing a transformer according to the techniques of the present invention result in lower resistive losses in the conductive material, thereby reducing eddy current losses and also increasing the transformer Q factor. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a multi-layer dual-damascene metallization techniques is employed to form the transformer. A plurality of parallel metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners are formed in a first stack of insulating materials. A second stack of insulating materials is disposed over the first stack and a plurality of first and second via openings are formed therein, wherein each one of the plurality of first via openings is in contact with a first end of a metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner, and each one of the plurality of second via openings is in contact with a second end of the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner. A metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> trench is formed within one or more upper layers of the second stack, and the first and the second via openings and trench are then filled with copper. The metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner is set back from the vertical plane of the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner. A third stack of insulating layers is disposed over the second stack and four via openings are formed therein. Third and fourth via openings are each in electrical contact with one of the first and second conductive vias, respectively. Fifth via openings are in contact with a first end of the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> trench and sixth via openings are in contact with a second end of the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> trench. A metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> trench is formed interconnecting the upper end of the fifth and sixth via openings, but the metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> trench connects two successive metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runners. Thus one end of the metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> trench is connected to a sixth via opening of a metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner and the other end of the metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> trench connects with the fifth via opening of the next metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner in the plurality of parallel metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runners. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth via openings and the metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> trenches are then filled with copper. A fourth stack of insulating layers is disposed over the structure and seventh and eighth via openings are formed therein and vertically aligned with the third and fourth conductive vias, respectively. A metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> trench is formed in the upper portion of the top insulating stack, with one end of the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runner in contact with an eighth via opening, and the other end of the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> trench in contact with a seventh via opening of the next metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner in the plurality of parallel metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners. In this way, the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> trench interconnects two successive metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners. The metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> trench and the seventh and eighth via openings are filled with copper. In a cross sectional view, the resulting structure forms two concentric rectangles of conductive material. In the top view, the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runners form a helix with each metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runner interconnecting successive metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners. Similarly, the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> runners form a helix with each metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> runner electrically interconnecting successive metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runners. The resulting structure comprises a transformer, with an outer winding formed by the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runners and an inner winding formed by the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> runners.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The description of the method for forming a transformer described below is generally directed to the formation of the elements associated with a single winding of the outer and the inner transformer coils. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a plurality of such windings are being simultaneously formed in the integrated circuit substrate. However, in the description below it is also frequently necessary to refer to interconnections between successive windings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The preferred process according to the present invention begins as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> where a plurality of insulating layers are formed over an existing integrated circuit substrate, which conventionally includes a plurality of active elements. Typically, at this point in the conventional fabrication process, no metal interconnect layers have been formed interconnecting active device regions; only the vias or windows for gaining access to the active device regions have been formed. A barrier layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> overlies the surface of the semiconductor substrate and is preferably formed of tantalum, tantalum-nitride, titanium or titanium-nitride. Next an insulating layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a relatively low dielectric constant material is formed over the barrier layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Low dielectric silicon dioxide, black diamond and coral are suitable candidates for the insulating layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The relative dielectric constant for silicon dioxide is about 3.9. Thus a low relative dielectric constant is generally considered to be less than about 3.0. A low dielectric constant material reduces inter-layer capacitance and therefore potential cross-talk between signals carried on the metal interconnects adjacent the dielectric layers. The barrier layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the insulating layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be formed by chemical vapor deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> overlying the insulating layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises a hard mask of silicon dioxide. To etch a layer or layers below a hard mask, photoresist material is applied over the hard mask, the photoresist is patterned and then the pattern is transferred from the photo resist to the hard mask. The photoresist is removed and the etching steps are carried out using the hard mask pattern. This process advantageously offers better dimensional control of the etched features. In lieu of a hard mask, conventional photoresist patterning and etching steps can be utilized. In either case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> window or trench <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed in the barrier layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, by the use of suitable etchants. In the top view, the trench <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is circular or elliptical. Generally, patterning and etching steps do not allow formation of sharp-cornered structural shapes, and thus windows and trenches, when viewed from the top, are typically circular, elliptical, or have relatively straight edges and rounded corners between the edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> barrier and seed layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is deposited. Typically, this is accomplished in two steps. First a barrier material is sputtered into the trench <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Tantalum, tantalum-nitride, titanium and titanium-nitride are candidate materials for the barrier layer. Next, a thin copper seed layer is deposited, preferably by sputtering. The seed layer is required as a starting layer for the electroplated copper. Both the barrier material and the seed material of the barrier and seed layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can also be deposited by conventional chemical vapor deposition and electroplating processes. A metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is now formed, preferably by electroplating copper. Electroplating is especially advantageous because it can be performed at a low temperature at a relatively low cost. The low temperature deposition feature is advantageous as it avoids changes in the dopant profiles. The substrate is then chemically-mechanically polished to remove the electroplated copper from all regions except within the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This process for depositing copper layers in the insulating layers is known as the damascene process. It offers superior dimensional control because it eliminates the variations introduced in a conventional metal pattern and etch process where the vias and the interconnects are formed in two separate steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In certain circuit configurations it may be necessary to connect the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to underlying regions in the substrate,. For instance, one end of the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner can serve as a transformer terminal for connection to another component in the circuit. This can be accomplished by a dual damascene process by first forming a via opening connecting one end of the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner to an underlying device region. The second step forms the trench <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the third step simultaneously fills the via opening and the trench <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to form a conductive via and the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Thus by this technique the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner is connected to the underlying device region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention is described and shown in the Figures with the bottom segment of the outer winding formed in the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> layer (and the top winding segment thereof formed in the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> layer), and thus the reference to the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner, the teachings of the present invention can be applied to form the bottom winding segment in a metal layer above metal layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For example, the bottom winding segment of the outer winding can be formed from a metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner and the top winding segment can be formed from a metal-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> runner. Similarly, the inner winding top and bottom metal segments can be formed in various layers, so long as they are formed between the top and bottom winding segments of the outer winding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> second four-layer stack is now formed over the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the adjacent regions of the layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The bottom layer in the four-layer stack comprises a barrier layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (preferably of titanium-nitride) as shown. An insulating layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> preferably having a relatively low dielectric constant is formed over the barrier layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and comprises low dielectric constant silicon-dioxide, black diamond or coral. The use of a low dielectric constant material is advantageous to reduce inter-layer capacitance and thus inter-layer cross-talk, but it is not required that the insulating layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprise a low-dielectric material. An etch stop layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, formed of, for example, silicon-nitride, is formed over the insulating layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Another insulating layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, preferably having a low dielectric constant, is formed over the etch stop layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A hard mask layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is formed over the insulating layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, conventional photoresist, masking and patterning processes can be used in lieu of the hard-mask layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> masking step employing the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> defines the areas where second-level via openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are to be formed. Using the defined pattern, the second-level via openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are then etched downwardly to the barrier layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. An additional etch step is then employed to remove the barrier layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the base of the via openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. At this point in the fabrication process there may be other areas of the integrated circuit that also require via openings at this level and therefore these can be formed simultaneously with the via openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In general, this is the case when any of the layers associated with the transformer are formed; via openings and trenches required in other regions of the integrated circuit can be simultaneously formed. Thus the method of the present invention does not add any additional masking steps to the integrated circuit formation process. It is only necessary to define additional regions for the transformer structures within the masks used to form vias and interconnects throughout the integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> trench <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is formed, extending downwardly to the etch stop layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, to effectively stop the etch process at the etch stop layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the etching process is monitored to analyze the byproducts that are etched from the material. In this case, when the material of the etch stop <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is detected, the etch process is terminated. As a result, the trench <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> extends downwardly through the mask layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the insulating layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, terminating within the etch stop layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As can be seen for the finished structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, preferably the trench <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is offset from the vertical plane of the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, such that the vertical plane of the trench <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is behind the vertical plane of the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A barrier and seed layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is deposited within the via openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the trench <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The process and materials are identical to those discussed in conjunction with the barrier and seed layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, copper is then preferably electroplated within the via openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the trench <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, followed by a chemical and mechanical polishing step to planarize the top surface. At this point, the two copper regions in the lower portion of the via openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are referred to as conductive vias <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The copper material in the upper regions (i.e., in the same horizontal plane as the trench <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>) of the via openings <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is referred to as metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via layers <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, respectively. The copper material in the trench <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is referred to as a metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> multi-layer stack is formed over the existing layers, where the material of the individual layers is preferably identical to the materials used in the multi-layer stack discussed in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In particular, the layers formed sequentially include a barrier layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (preferably comprising material having a low dielectric constant), an etch stop layer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (again preferably comprising a low dielectric constant material), and a hard mask layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is patterned and etched to form four via openings. Two via openings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> extend downwardly from the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to the top surface of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in substantial vertical alignment with the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via layers <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, respectively. Two additional via openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> extend downwardly from the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to the top surface of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in vertical alignment with end regions <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Recall that the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner is in a plane behind the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, thus the via openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> are in a vertical plane behind the via openings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment the via openings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> have the same size in the horizontal dimension of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The exposed barrier layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the via openings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is then removed by an additional etch step. The hard mask layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is again patterned and etched to form a trench <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> extending vertically from the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to the top surface of the etch stop layer <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from the top view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the trench <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is in a vertical plane that intersects the vertical plane of the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. Thus, the trench <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> extends rearward from the vertical plane of the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> for interconnecting two successive parallel metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Barrier layers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are then applied to the interior surfaces of the four via openings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the trench <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. Metal is then deposited or electroplated within the via openings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the trench <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. Thus conductive vias <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are formed within the via openings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, respectively. The two conductive regions in the lower portion of the via openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> are referred to as conductive vias <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, respectively. The conductive material in the upper regions of the via openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is referred to as metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via layers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, respectively. The conductive material in the trench <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is referred to as a metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The resulting structure is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, but again note that the metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> interconnects two successive metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, which is not necessarily apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To complete formation of the transformer of the present invention, another stack of insulating layers is disposed on the top surface of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> structure. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, this stack of insulating layers comprises: a barrier layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (preferably formed of a material having a relatively low dielectric constant) an etch stop layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (preferably formed of silicon nitride) a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (preferably formed of a material having a relatively low dielectric constant) and a hard mask layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. A patterning and etching process, using a pattern masked into the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, forms a pair of via openings extending downwardly from the hard mask <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to the top surface of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and in substantially vertical alignment with the conductive vias <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The exposed portions of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the pair of via openings is then removed. A second masking and etching step forms a trench extending between the pair of via openings and having a bottom surface adjacent the top surface of the etch stop layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. A barrier layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, is deposited on the interior surfaces of the pair of vias and the trench. Metal, preferably copper, is deposited to form conductive vias <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via layers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> aligned vertically therewith, respectively. An interconnecting metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is also formed, to interconnect two successive metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners via the two stacks of conductive vias shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Thus one end of the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is in the same vertical plane as the conductive via <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via layer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> connected to the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the other end of the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runner is connected to the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the conductive via <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> connected to the next metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the plurality of parallel metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the transformer appears as two concentric closed polygons (rectangles in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) forming the outer and inner windings. A top view of the transformer constructed according to the teachings of the present invention, is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and reveals the third dimension orientation of the various transformer components. Two successive parallel metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are interconnected by a diagonal metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, via vertical conductive structures <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The vertical conductive structure <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> comprises the conductive via <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via layer <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, the conductive via <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the conductive via <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The vertical conductive structure <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> comprises the conductive via <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via layer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the conductive via <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the conductive via <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via layer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>.

The vertical conductive structure <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> comprises the conductive via <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and the metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via layer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The vertical conductive structure <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> comprises the conductive via <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and the metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The plurality of metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the plurality of metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can take on various other orientations and interconnection configurations. For instance, the angle between each metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be made greater than or equal to 90&deg; to produce a zig-zag pattern in the top view. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Alternatively, both the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be L-shaped and interconnected such that the short leg on one runner connects to the long leg of the next runner. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Typically, the transformer secondary windings, comprising the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and the metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> runner <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, have the same shape and orientation as the primary windings. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12, 13</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The turns ratio between the outer and inner windings (either of which can operate as the primary winding while the other operates as the secondary winding) of the transformer can be modified by changing the distance between successive metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> relative to the distance between successive metal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-runners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, so that greater or fewer number of coils or turns comprising the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and metal-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are positioned between successive metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> runners <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Although the Figures and description herein illustrate placement of the bottom and top metal layers of the outer winding in the metal-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and metal-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> layers of the integrated circuit, the inventive features of the present invention can be applied such that the transformer structure spans other metal layers, for example, the bottom segment of the outer windings can be placed within the metal-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> layer and the top segment within the metal-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> layer. The inner windings similarly span any number of metal layers between the metal layers spanned by the outer winding. Other embodiments where different metal layers are spanned are considered within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the multi-layer transformer formed according to the teachings of the present invention is compatible with conventional CMOS backflow (i.e., interconnect) processing and does not require any additional masking steps during the process of fabricating the CMOS devices. Because the conductive structures are formed of copper, the resulting conductor has relatively lower resistance than those formed with aluminum and thus a higher Q. The inner winding is completely enclosed within the outer winding, resulting in a relatively high coupling factor. As illustrated by the processing steps discussed above, the transformer is highly integratable either on-chip with other active elements or as part of a multi-module device constructed on a common substrate. Although the two windings are conventionally designed for simultaneous use to provide transformer action, they can be used independently as inductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Although formation of the outer and inner windings of the transformer according to the present invention has been described using a damascene process, the invention is not limited thereto. The transformer windings can also be formed using conventional metal deposition and etch steps wherein the metal layers forming the top and bottom winding segments are interconnected by vertical vias spanning at least three metal layers, i.e., at least one metal layer is not used to form either a top or a bottom winding segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> An architecture and process have been described as useful for forming a thin film multi-layer high Q transformers on a semiconductor substrate. While specific applications of the invention have been illustrated, the principals disclosed herein provide a basis for practicing the invention in a variety of ways and in a variety of circuit structures. Numerous variations are possible within the scope of the invention, including the use of any two metal layers to form the transformer windings.
