<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A genre of computer video game is known as a role-playing game (RPG). In an RPG, generally, a character performs a role in a game in place of a player, and by controlling this character (hereinafter, the player character) the player experiences a virtual adventure while causing a story involving the player character to unfold. In most cases, a character which opposes the player character (hereinafter, an enemy character) is provided in each of a number of set zones formed in a virtual space. The story is then caused to unfold by the player character proceeding from one zone to the next and fighting with and defeating enemy characters seeking to prevent the player character from achieving a certain objective in the story. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The player character is controlled by means of buttons on a keypad, a joystick or the like. In response to control operations performed on this keypad, the player character moves and carries out predetermined actions. In the course of the story, numerous events such as battle scenes are provided. In these events, the game proceeds on the basis of selection operations being carried out by the player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although in battle scenes of video games of related art, in many cases a player character and an enemy character fight one-on-one, video games have also been proposed that make the game more interesting by allowing a number of player characters and a number of enemy characters to fight. Also proposed are video games where multiple player characters and multiple enemy characters can fight in a predetermined order and it is possible, as necessary, to replace a player character taking part in a scene such as a battle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, in video games of the related art, there has been the problem that the greater the number of characters taking part in a battle, and the more complicated are the actions that the player characters perform, the more difficult it becomes to keep track of their state. In worst cases, it has sometimes happened that the player performs an erroneous control operation and a character does not carry out the action that the player intended. Thus, the enjoyability of the game is reduced. Additionally, in some video games, when selecting a character to be the object of an action to be performed by a player character, not only is the control operation monotonous, but there has been the problem that because there is no response from the character, the process lacks a sense of reality. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The disk drive <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is so constructed that the disc (DVD or CD-ROM) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is a recording medium, can be removably loaded into it, and reads video game program data, picture data, audio data and other data held on the disc <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The communications interface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is connected to a network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and acquires various kinds of data by performing data communications with data storage devices and information processing devices such as servers installed in other locations. The video game program data, picture data, audio data and other data held in the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may alternatively be acquired by way of a network <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the communications interface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The memory card reader/writer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is so constructed that a memory card <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be removably loaded into it, and writes save data of a relatively low volume, such as mid-way progress data of video games and video game environment setting data, to a memory card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> On a recording medium pertaining to this preferred embodiment of the invention, that is, the disc <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is recorded a video game program capable of displaying multiple characters including player characters and enemy characters on a screen and controlling actions of the displayed characters in accordance with control operations of a player, and this can be read by a computer (the CPU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and its peripheral devices). The computer can accept the input of a candidate character intended to be the object of an action to be performed by a predetermined character in accordance with control operations of the player. The computer also can perform image-control so that the line of sight of the predetermined character points to the candidate character input-accepted when accepting input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The computer can also accept a second input of a second action to be performed by a predetermined character in accordance with control operations of a player; distinguish the second action accepted as the second input; and execute the second action accepted as the second input in accordance with control operations of the player and performing image-control in accordance with a distinguishing result obtained when distinguishing the second action so that the line of sight of the predetermined character and the line of sight of the candidate character assume a predetermined relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the game unit proper <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has, besides the functions necessary for carrying out a related art video game by software processing based on data held in the CPU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the various memories, as special functions, a first function of accepting the input of a candidate character intended to be the object of an action to be performed by a predetermined character in accordance with control operations of the player, and further a function of performing image-control so that the line of sight of the predetermined character points to this input-accepted candidate character. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The game unit proper <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> also has a second function of accepting the input of an action to be performed by a predetermined character in accordance with control operations of a player; a function of distinguishing the action input-accepted by the second function; and a function of executing the action input-accepted by the second function in accordance with control operations of a player and performing image-control in accordance with the result of distinguishing the action so that the line of sight of the predetermined character and the line of sight of the candidate character assume a predetermined relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As a result a video game can be realized with which it is possible to exploit the particular characteristics of the video game to raise its sense of reality and with which it is possible to understand easily which character is to be the object of an action of a player character. Instead of being realized by software processing, these functions may alternatively be realized by the provision of appropriate dedicated hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of this preferred embodiment will be explained. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing an example of a processing routine of the overall operation of the preferred embodiment described above. The steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> have been assigned the reference numerals S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> First, when a power supply (not shown) is turned on, a boot program is read out; the different parts are initialized; and processing for starting a game is carried out. That is, by the disk drive <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, video game program data, picture data, audio data and other data held in the disc (DVD or CD-ROM) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are read out and stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and as necessary, data held in nonvolatile memory such as the EEPROM of the ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the hard disc drive <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, or the memory card <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are read out and stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Before the start of an actual game, various settings are carried out to reach a state from which a game can proceed. Then, when a game is started from this state, a scene such as a movement scene, a battle scene or some other scene is set, and processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> it is determined whether or not the present scene is a movement scene, and if it is not a movement scene processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and determines whether or not it is a battle scene. When in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> it is determined that the scene is not a battle scene, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and it is determined whether or not the scene is another scene (conversation, shopping or picking up). When in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> it is determined that the scene is not another scene, processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the processing of steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is repeated so that a standby state is assumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When in this state it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that the present scene is a movement scene, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a movement control input-accepting state is assumed. And in step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, movement processing corresponding to an accepted movement control input is carried out. When the movement processing ends, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and movement information is generated on the basis of player character position information derived successively along with the movement processing. The movement information includes information showing a set zone in a virtual space in which the present player character is positioned. When the movement information has been generated, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> it is determined that the present scene is a battle scene, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a battle control input-accepting state is assumed. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, battle processing corresponding to input-accepted battle control operations is carried out; a battle is fought between multiple player characters and multiple enemy characters in a combination freely selected by the player; and processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, battle information is generated which shows for example names of the player characters and enemy characters which fought; the progress of the battle; the result of the battle; and parameters stipulating the capabilities of the player characters. When the battle information has been generated, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> it is determined that the present scene is some other scene (conversation, shopping, picking up or the like), the routine proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and processing according to the scene is carried out; other information corresponding to that processing is generated; and the routine proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When processing reaches step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the present position of the player character is successively updated by movement information being stored in a predetermined data area of the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. And, along with that, battle zone information for each set zone and other information is stored in a predetermined data area of the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. That is, an action history of the player character is stored for each set zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Then, in step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, action evaluation processing is carried out on the basis of the information showing the action history of the player character stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Specifically, for information of which numbering is necessary, numbering is carried out using a pre-prepared conversion table. For information of which weighting is necessary, predetermined coefficients are applied. These figures are totalled to calculate a score. The calculated score is added to a previous score held in a predetermined data area of the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and by this being stored again in a predetermined data area of the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a score constituting evaluation information is successively updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When action evaluation processing ends like this, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and determines whether the game is over, and when the game is not over, processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the processing of step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> described above is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> When in step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> it is determined that the game is over, although this is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the information showing the action history of characters, the evaluation information, and the player character capability settings information held in a predetermined area of the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are each read from the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and transferred to and stored together with other data in rewritable nonvolatile memory such as the EEPROM of the ROM <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the hard disc drive <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, or the memory card <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. After other kinds of processing accompanying the ending of a game are carried out, the power supply is cut off and the game ends. When the power supply is switched on again, the various information and other data thus held in nonvolatile memory by data save processing before power supply cut-off are read out from the nonvolatile memory to which they were saved and stored again in the same data area of the RAM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in which they were held before the power supply was cut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing an example of a processing procedure for the battle control operation input-acceptance processing (step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) of the preferred embodiment described above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows an example of a specific display picture pertaining to battle control operation input-acceptance processing, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</cross-reference> show parts of the same display picture. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, battle control operation input-acceptance processing in the preferred embodiment described above will now be explained. The steps in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> have been assigned the reference numerals S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C the reference number <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> denotes a player character taking part in a battle and the reference numbers <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> denote enemy characters, and it will be assumed that a battle can be fought with any combination of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the enemy characters <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> First, when the battle control operation input-acceptance processing is reached in the routine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an initial battle picture is displayed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. In this initial battle picture, the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the enemy characters <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> are displayed confronting each other. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the reference number <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> denotes a cursor for pointing to a candidate character intended to be the object of an action; however, this cursor is not displayed at this stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> it is determined whether or not the L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-button <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has been pressed, and when it is determined that the L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-button <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has been pressed processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. When processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a state is assumed wherein the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> can be replaced with a substitute character. That is, a substitute character is selected by a control operation of the player, and character substitution processing is carried out as necessary between the selected substitute character and the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. When the character substitution processing ends, processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the initial battle picture is displayed. And also when character substitution is canceled part-way through, processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the initial battle picture is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> And when in step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> it is determined that the L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-button <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has not been pressed, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>; a state for accepting the input of an action (command input) to be executed by the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is assumed; and an action is selected in accordance with an operation of the &plus;-key <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> display region for action selection is omitted. Then, in step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has been pressed, and when it is determined that the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has not been pressed processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the processing of step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is repeated so that a standby state is assumed until either the L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-button <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is pressed or the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> When in step S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> it is determined that the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has been pressed, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>; selection of the action selected at that time is confirmed, various associated processing is carried out, and the displayed picture changes to a battle execution picture. At this time, the cursor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is displayed for the first time, and a candidate character intended to be the object of an action determined by internal processing is indicated. When the various processing associated with action determination ends and the displayed picture changes to a battle execution picture, processing moves on to step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> When processing reaches step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a state for accepting the input of a candidate character intended to be the object of the action of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is assumed; a candidate character is selected in accordance with a number of times the &plus;-key <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is pressed; and in step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the cursor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is controlled and displayed in accordance with the selection operation. In step S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, line of sight control of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is implemented, and processing then proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether or not the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has been pressed. When it is determined that the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has not been pressed, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and it is determined whether or not the &times;-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has been pressed. When it is determined that the &times;-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has not been pressed, processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the processing of step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is repeated so that a standby state, wherein candidate character selection input is accepted, is assumed until either the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is pressed or the &times;-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> That is, each time the &plus;-key <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is pressed once, the cursor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> moves from one displayed character to the next to indicate a selected candidate character, and the line of sight of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is pointed at that candidate character. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> For example, it is assumed that each time the &plus;-key <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is pressed once the cursor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> moves around from character to character in the order <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>&rarr;<highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>&rarr;<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>&rarr;<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. . . . When from the initial state wherein the battle execution picture has been reached but the &plus;-key has not been pressed the &plus;-key is pressed once, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> the cursor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> moves to the enemy character <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and the line of sight of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> (shown with a dashed arrow in the figure) is pointed to the enemy character <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. And when the &plus;-key is pressed again, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> the cursor <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> moves to the enemy character <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the line of sight of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> (shown with a dashed arrow in the figure) is pointed at the enemy character <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the player can easily make out the candidate character on the basis of the line of sight of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When the selection of a candidate character is input-accepted like this and then in step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> it is determined that the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has been pressed, the candidate character is confirmed as the object of the action and processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. When processing reaches step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, distinguishing of the action to be performed by the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is carried out, and in step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> control information for implementing predetermined line of sight control according to the distinguishing result is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When the setting of the control information is finished, processing proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the confirmed action is executed, and line of sight control is implemented between the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the selected character. Consequently, one sequence of battle control operation input-acceptance processing ends with the lines of sight of the two characters still controlled to a predetermined relationship. When in step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> it is determined that the &times;-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has been pressed, processing returns to step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the initial battle picture is displayed again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The control of the lines of sight of the characters is now explained. For each character, there are prepared multiple images of which the body of the character faces a different way, and there are also prepared multiple images which the body faces the same way, but the face of the character faces a different way. Then, in line of sight control on selection of a candidate character, a direction is detected on the basis of the position information for each of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the enemy characters <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and by a certain image of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> being displayed in accordance with that direction, its line of sight is controlled to the direction of the candidate character. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In line of sight control on action execution, a direction is detected successively on the basis of position information of the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> arising from internal processing and position information of the character to be the object of the action. By the player character <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and a certain image of the character to be the object of the action being displayed in accordance with the direction and the action, the directions of the lines of sight of the two are controlled to a predetermined relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> For example, when there are multiple player characters and a defense action such as &lsquo;magic&rsquo; (command name) is to be executed with respect to a supporting character, the lines of sight are controlled so that the side using the &lsquo;magic&rsquo; faces in the direction of the position of the opposing supporting character and then the supporting character on which the &lsquo;magic&rsquo; has been used faces in the direction of the position of the player character which used the &lsquo;magic&rsquo;. Conversely, when a character has &lsquo;magic&rsquo; used on it by an opposing supporting character, from when the &lsquo;magic&rsquo; is used, the line of sight of the character is controlled so as to point in the direction of the position of the opposing supporting character. And when a player character executes an attack action such as &lsquo;fight&rsquo; (command name) with respect to an enemy character, the lines of sight of the attacking side and the side being attacked are both held so that they point at each other. Consequently, players can, to some extent, understand the state of execution of an action from the lines of sight of the two characters involved. When &lsquo;magic&rsquo; is used on all of a number of enemies (or supporters), by the line of sight of the supporting (or enemy) character using the &lsquo;magic&rsquo; being made to face the front, the situation can be understood more easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Thus, the preferred embodiment described above provides the following effects. A first effect is that because the line of sight of a predetermined character about to execute an action is controlled so that it points at a candidate character, the player can easily understand which is the candidate character, and the enjoyability of the game can be maintained. A second effect is that because a predetermined input-accepted action is executed the line of sight of the predetermined character performing the action and the line of sight of the candidate character are controlled so that they assume a predetermined relationship. The relationship between the predetermined character and the candidate character can then, to some extent, be understood and the enjoyability of the game can be better maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Next, other preferred embodiments will be described. In the preferred embodiment described above, in the battle control input-acceptance processing, a case wherein control commands relating to battle control operations are accepted using the L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-button <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the &plus;-key <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the O-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the &times;-button <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>was described; however, other buttons may alternatively be used. And whereas a case was described in which only the timing at which a switch is turned on after its respective button is pressed is monitored in the input-accepting of operation commands, alternatively operation commands may be accepted using the timing at which the switch linked to the respective button is turned off, or both the on and the off timing of the switch linked to a respective button can be monitored and both combined to input-accept operation commands. Also, the time for which a switch linked to a respective button is on or off can be combined to input-accept operation commands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment described above, a case is described wherein the line of sight of a predetermined character about to execute an action is controlled so as to point to a candidate character. Also, in the execution of a predetermined action, the line of sight of the predetermined character performing the action and the line of sight of the candidate character are controlled so as to assume a predetermined relationship, also, between the position of the character whose line of sight has been directed and the position of a character at which the line of sight is directed. A display which associates the relationship of the two may be carried out in the representation of the background of the characters. However, the effects of the invention can be obtained by controlling the line of sight of the predetermined character performing the action and the line of sight of the candidate character so that they assume a predetermined relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments described above, and it will be clear that various changes and modifications are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the order of the steps of a method according to the invention can be changed within the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As described above, with the present invention it is possible to exploit the particular characteristics of the video game to raise its sense of reality and it is possible to understand easily which character is to be the object of an action of a player character and to maintain the enjoyability of the game. </paragraph>
