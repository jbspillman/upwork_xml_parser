<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a differential output signal circuit suitable for restraining voltage overshooting/undershooting at differential output terminals due to lags in input signals and realizing stable and fast switching of differential input signals, a first differential pair of PMOS transistors connected to a first current source and a second differential pair of NMOS transistors connected to a second current source are mutually connected at the differential output terminals, and a capacitor is connected between the connection nodes of the respective differential pairs and current sources. A transitional current path of the capacitor restrains voltage variations during differential input signal switching. Further in a signal detection apparatus suitable for realizing the detection of fast transmitted differential input signals with less current consumption and at low cost, an edge detect signal is supplied against a differential input of or above a prescribed value, and a setting signal is issued when this edge detect signal has been detected a prescribed number of times during a first prescribed length of time while a resetting signal is issued if none is detected during a second prescribed length of time. A signal-detect signal is generated from these setting signal and resetting signal. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a differential signal output apparatus for interface signals outputted as differential signals on a transmission line in digital interfacing for serial communication and determination of the presence/absence of transmitted interface signals, and more particularly to a differential signal output apparatus and determination of the presence/absence of transmitted interface signals suitably usable for serial communicating having a high speed digital interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to the prior art, in high speed serial communication, typically represented by IEEE 1394 serial bus, differential signals are transmitted using a coaxial cable or a twisted pair cable as the transmission line. These differential signals have a differential amplitude of about 200 mV and a maximum data transfer rate of as fast as 400 megabits/sec according to the IEEE 1394-1995 standard, for instance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further in recent years, the P1394b standard is being formulated to realize high speed transmission over a long transmission distance as the next generation standard of IEEE 1394, as the voltage amplitude level of differential input signals and the like transmitted over a twisted pair cable or some other transmission line, high speed data transmission of about 800 mV in differential amplitude and 800 megabits/sec in maximum data transfer rate has come to be required, and circuit configurations with enhanced drive capacities for differential output signals to realize this high speed transmission are being devised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the P1394b standard, there is required a signal detection circuit which detects the voltage amplitude level of differential input signals and the like transmitted over a twisted pair cable or some other transmission line; if it is not above a prescribed level, outputs the detect signal as a low level; if a voltage amplitude level not below the prescribed level is detected, determines it as a high level; and notifies the detection of input signals from the transmission line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As a circuit configuration with an enhanced drive capacity for differential output signals, for instance, a differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is conceived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the source terminals of PMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected in common to a node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a power supply voltage VDD via a first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The drain terminals of the PMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to the drain terminals of NMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to constitute differential output terminals OUT and OUTX. The source terminals of the NMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected in common to a node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be connected to a ground voltage GND via a second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.The gate terminal of the PMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the gate terminal of the NMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are connected to constitute one differential input terminal IP, and the gate terminal of the PMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the gate terminal of the NMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected to constitute the other differential input terminal IM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the PMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the NMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> configured into an inverter, and in the PMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the NMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> configured into another inverter, the PMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the one hand and the NMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the other respectively constitute first and second differential pairs. The current from the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the source current side is controlled which differential pair to go through to get to the second source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the sink current side, i.e., to go through the first differential pair or the second differential pair. By mutually connecting these first and second differential pairs and using the connection points as the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX, it is made possible to directly drive the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX in the responses of differential outputs OUT and OUTX to differential inputs IP and IM by supplying source/sink currents to them, and fast responsiveness is thereby achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, in the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the source terminals of the PMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and of the NMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the inverter configuration of the first differential pair Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the second differential pair Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to the power supply voltage VDD via the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and to the ground voltage GND via the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.Therefore, the voltage at the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to which the source terminals of the PMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected is lower than the power supply voltage VDD by the operating voltage of the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the voltage at the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to which the source terminals of the NMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are connected is higher than the ground voltage GND by the operating voltage of the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.Supposing here that first and second current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are current mirror circuits made up of MOS transistors and the threshold voltage of the MOS transistors is 0.7 V in absolute value, the operating currents of the first and second current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be presumed to be around 1 V, though it depends on the transistor size and amperage. If the power supply voltage VDD is 3.3 V, the voltage applied between the source terminals of the first and second differential pairs Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the inverter configuration will be only about 3.3 V&minus;1 V&minus;1 V&equals;1.3 V. As the threshold voltage of the MOS transistors is 0.7 V, the intermediate voltage at the operating points of the transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the inverter configuration is 0.65 V (&equals;1.3 V/2) from each source terminal. Whereas the operating points are the centers of input signal switching, all of the transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the inverter configuration are turned off at these points. Thus, in a transitional state at the time the differential input signals are switched, there is a period in which all of the transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the inverter configuration are turned off and current paths are cut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the first and second current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> keep on flowing constant currents all the time. Therefore, when the current paths are cut off, a current flows into the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, resulting in charging of parasitic capacitance components including the capacitance components and wiring capacitances of the source terminals of the transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, whose voltage is thereby raised. Similarly a current flows out of the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, resulting in discharging of parasitic capacitance components including the capacitance components and wiring capacitances of the source terminals of the transistors Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected to the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, whose voltage is thereby lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Upon termination of the switching period of the differential input signal, the transistors on the side having been non-conductive before the switching are conductive to connect the current paths again. Then, the charges/discharges which were effected when the current paths were cut off are discharged/charged via these current paths from or to the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX. Thus there is the problem of voltage overshooting/undershooting at the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX immediately after the switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25, a</cross-reference> differential signal output circuit wherein either pair of the first and second differential pairs Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is replaced with resistance elements or the like, or in a known differential signal output circuit provided with a passive load or an active load shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> for use not only in high speed transmission but also in general applications, element characteristics may differ owing to fluctuations in manufacturing between the transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, Q<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or Q<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. These difference in element characteristics may give rise to differences in response characteristics, resulting in a lag in operational timing at the time of differential input signal switching between the differential pairs Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to turn off both the transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> constituting the differential pairs. As the current paths from the current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are cut off in this case, too, the voltages of nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected to the current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> vary transitionally, inviting a problem that the varied voltages propagate to the differential output terminals at the timing of the next turning-on of the other transistors of the differential pairs Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and give rise to overshooting or undershooting at the differential output terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further, if there is any difference in wiring delay in the differential input signals, a lag in the timing of switching will occur between the differential pairs Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In this case, too, if the delay relationship is added in such a manner as will give rise to an off period for all of the differential pairs Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, there will again arise a problem that, as in the above-described case, voltage overshooting or undershooting occurs at the differential output terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Under the P1394b standard, on the other hand, even high speed than the 400 Mbps of the conventional IEEE 1394 standard is contemplated, and high speed transmission standards from 800 Mbps (commonly known as the S800 standard) to 3.2 Gbps (commonly known as the S3200 standard) are formulated. In order to detect the voltage amplitude level of data signals at the transmission of the S3200 standard at the maximum by bit-by-bit sampling, the signal detection circuit is required by the Nyquist sampling theorem to operate at a high sampling frequency of no less than 6.4 GHz, double the frequency of 3.2 GHz. In order to realize a signal detection circuit required to operate at such a high speed, it is usually configured of a bipolar transistor whose cutoff frequency is higher than that of a MOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> illustrates an example of signal detection circuit <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> for detecting the voltage amplitude level of data signals bit by bit. Out of the differential input signals, an input signal IN&plus; on the positive logic side is entered into a peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The peak voltage level of the input signal IN&plus; is supplied from the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and entered into a voltage level detector <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. If the input signal IN&plus; is above a prescribed voltage level, the transmission of an effective differential input signal is assumed, and a signal-detect signal SD is set to a high level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> here consists of an the operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, a diode D<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and a capacitor C<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The input signal IN&plus; is entered into the non-inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, and the output terminal of the operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is arranged for input to the anode terminal of the diode D<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The cathode terminal of the diode D<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is arranged for feedback to the inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier A<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and connected to the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, a reset switch S<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> for discharging the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel to the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and controlled with a reset signal R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Also, the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is arranged for inputting from the output terminal of the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to the non-inverting input terminal, and a preset detection level voltage VREF is entered into the inverting input terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Since the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> constitutes a voltage follower circuit into which the diode D<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is inserted in the forward direction, the entered input signal IN&plus; is supplied at the output terminal of the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, which is the cathode terminal of the diode D<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. As the diode D<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is inserted in the forward direction into a feedback path in the voltage follower configuration, the output voltage of the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> can follow any rise in the input signal IN&plus;, but, against a voltage drop of the input signal IN&plus; conversely, the inverse direction characteristic of the diode D<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> causes the output terminal of the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to maintain its output voltage. The capacitor C<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> connected to the output terminal of the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is provided to maintain the output voltage in this process. The reset switch S<highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is provided for resetting the peak voltage set in the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> with the reset signal R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The voltage level detector <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> constitutes a comparator. It compares the output voltage entered into the non-inverting input terminal from the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> with the output voltage entered into the inverting input terminal from the detection level voltage VREF. If the output voltage from the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is found lower than the detection level voltage VREF, a low level is outputted as the signal-detect signal SD if it is higher, inversion takes place to output a high level thereby to notify the detection of effective differential input signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As stated above, in order to sample the input signal IN&plus; bit by bit, a maximum sampling frequency of 6.4 GHz or more, double the 3.2 GHz (S3200 standard) data transfer rate, is required. Therefore, the peak hold circuit <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> have to be configured around high speed bipolar transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> However, although a bipolar transistor can help realize high speed operation, high speed operation of a circuit comprising a bipolar element requires a large bias current, making it difficult to realize less power consuming operation. The P1394b standard is expected to find increasing use in personal computers and portable equipment including mobile information terminals. Portable equipment is required to permit continuous battery-powered use for many hours and, because of the needed portability, high density packaging. Therefore, both with a view to extending the duration of continuous use and in view of the packaging limitation on the permissible heat generation from the chip, a signal detection circuit conforming to P1394b is required to operate without large current consumption, and the signal detection circuit of the above-described configuration involves the problem of inability to satisfy these requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as is typically the case with high density packaging required by portable equipment, realization of diverse functions under the P1394b standard in a high density of integration requires a system LSI configuration constituted of CMOS transistors. It is preferable also to integrate into this system LSI a signal detection circuit for detecting differential input signals from the transmission path. However, as the cut-off frequency of a MOS transistor is lower than the cut-off frequency of a bipolar transistor, it is impossible to realize with a system LSI configured of CMOS transistors the detection of the voltage amplitude level of the differential input signals by bit-by-bit sampling, which is required under the P1394b standard. Therefore, it is inevitable to use a two chip configuration in which the signal detection circuit is constituted of a bipolar LSI and other functions are constituted of a system LSI consisting of CMOS transistors, resulting in a problem that a sufficiently high density of packaging may not be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is further conceivable to develop a novel BiCMOS LSI permitting the packaging of the bipolar transistor part to realize the signal detection circuit and the CMOS transistor part to realize other functions into a single chip. However, development of a novel LSI permitting the realization of a high speed bipolar transistor on a single chip together with a minute CMOS transistor capable of integrating large scale circuits would take enormous time and money, which means the problem of difficulty to achieve the purpose at an appropriate timing and a reasonable cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention, attempted to resolve the above-noted problems with the prior art, is intended to provide a differential signal output apparatus which is required to operate at high speed by the demand for fast data transmission in the next generation digital interfacing, the differential signal output apparatus being capable of realizing stable high speed differential input signal switching by restraining the voltage overshooting and undershooting at differential output terminals due to timing lags of differential input signals owing to lags in response characteristics or differences in wiring delay ensuing from hardware configuration or fluctuations in manufacturing, a semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus having the differential signal output apparatus and a differential signal transmission system, and further to provide a signal detection apparatus, a signal detection method, a signal transmission system and a computer-readable program capable of realizing detection of input signals transmitted at high data transfer speed without large current consumption and at low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above-stated object, a differential signal output apparatus according to first aspect of the invention is provided with a differential pair for receiving differential signals; a current source, connected to one end of the differential pair, for supplying a current to the differential pair; and a capacitor connected between a branching node for branching from the current source to transistors and a low impedance node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the differential signal output apparatus, during a transitional period in which a current supplied from the current source connected to one end of the differential pair is switched between the transistors constituting the differential pair with the differential input signals to the differential pair, a current flows via the capacitor connected between the branching node for branching from the current source to the transistors constituting the differential pair and the low impedance node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This prevents the voltage at the connecting node between the differential pair and the current source from varying even if any difference in response characteristics of the differential pair arising from element characteristics due to manufacturing fluctuations between the transistors constituting the differential pair and, even if there is a period during which both transistors are off as a consequence of any lag in the timing of operation at the time of differential input signal switching, because a transitional current path to the low impedance node is secured via the capacitor. Therefore, neither voltage overshooting nor voltage undershooting occurs at the differential output terminals at the timing when the completion of differential input signal switching causes the other one of the transistors constituting the differential pair to be turned on. Stable differential output signals can be obtained even when differential input signals are switched at high speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A differential signal output apparatus according to a second aspect of the invention is provided with a differential pair for receiving differential signals; a first current source, connected to one end of the differential pair, for supplying a current to the differential pair; and a capacitor connected between a branching node for branching from the first current source to transistors constituting the differential pair and a current supply unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the differential signal output apparatus, during a transitional period in which a current supplied from the first current source connected to one end of the differential pair is switched between the transistors constituting the differential pair with the differential input signals to the differential pair, a current flows via the capacitor connected between the branching node for branching from the current source to the transistors constituting the differential pair and the current supply unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This makes it possible to secure a sufficient supply capacity for a transitional current if the current supply unit has a current supply capacity equal to or greater than the amperage supplied by the first current source, and to reliably restrain voltage variations at the connecting node between the differential pair and the first current source. Therefore, voltage overshooting and undershooting at differential output terminals can be restrained without fail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A differential signal output apparatus according to a third aspect of the invention is provided with a differential pair for receiving differential signals; a current source, connected to one end of the differential pair, for supplying a current to the differential pair; and a transitional response circuit for forming a current path for letting the current supplied from the current source flow when the current to the differential pair is cut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the differential signal output apparatus, during a transitional period in which the current from the current source, connected to one end of the differential pair, to the differential pair is cut off, the transitional response unit forms a current path for letting the current supplied from the current source flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This makes it possible to sufficiently flow the current from the current source if the current path formed by the transitional response unit has a capacity to flow a current equal to or greater than the amperage supplied by the current source, even though the current to the differential pair is cut off, and to reliably restrain voltage variations at the connecting node between the differential pair and the current source. Therefore, voltage overshooting and undershooting at differential output terminals can be restrained without fail. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus, wiring is done between differential input signals and between differential output signals. The transistors constituting the differential pair are arranged symmetrically, and the current source connected to one end of the differential pair is so arranged that connection wiring lines between the current source and the transistors be symmetrical. The capacitor connected between the branching node for branching connection wiring from the current source to the transistors and the low impedance node is arranged in the area between the transistors. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus, wiring is done between differential input signals and between differential output signals. The transistors constituting the differential pair are arranged symmetrically, and the first current source connected to one end of the differential pair is so arranged that connection wiring lines between the first current source and the transistors be symmetrical. The capacitor having the same symmetry as the symmetry of arrangement between the transistors and connected between the branching node for branching connection wiring from the first current source to the transistors is arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus according to the third aspect of the invention comprises a differential signal output circuit provided with a first differential pair constituted by arranging wiring between differential input signals and between differential output signals and arranging transistors of a first conductivity type symmetrically; a first current source connected to one end of the first differential pair and so arranged that connection wiring lines to the transistors of the first conductivity type be symmetrical; a second differential pair arranged opposite the first differential pair, constituted by arranging wiring between differential input signals and between differential output signals and transistors of a second conductivity type symmetrically; a second current source connected to one end of the second differential pair and so arranged that connection wiring lines to the transistors of the second conductivity type be symmetrical; and a capacitor connected between a first branching node for branching connection wiring from the first current source to the transistors of the first conductivity type and a second branching node for branching connection wiring from the second current source to the transistors of the second conductivity type and arranged in an area surrounded by the first differential pair and the second differential pair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus, wiring is done between differential input signals and between differential output signals. The transistors constituting the first and second differential pairs and the first and second current sources are arranged symmetrically. The transistors constituting the first and second differential pairs are arranged opposite each other. The first and second current sources respectively connected to one end each of the first and second differential pairs are so arranged that the connection wiring lines to the transistors be symmetrical. The capacitor is arranged in the area surrounded by the first and second differential pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor integrated circuit apparatuses according to the first through third aspects of the invention can minimize dispersion of characteristics among and balance the wiring loads between the differential input signals and the differential output signals by symmetrically arranging the constituent elements of the differential signal output apparatus, resulting minimization of differences in propagation delay of the differential signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As the symmetry of the capacitor relative to the constituent elements and wiring lines can be enhanced at the same time, the semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus according to the first aspect can minimize any imbalance of voltage variations at the node connecting the differential pair and the current source at the time of differential input signal switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus according to the second aspect can minimize any imbalance of voltage variations at the node connecting the differential pair and the first current source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus according to the third aspect can minimize any imbalance of voltage variations at the node connecting the first and second differential pairs and the first and second current sources, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Therefore, they can effectively restrain voltage overshooting and voltage undershooting at the differential output terminals. Furthermore, where there is a so-called temperature gradient, i.e. where the chip temperature varies with the position on the semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus from the heat source, the constituent elements can be cause to operate with similar temperature characteristics if there is a symmetric layout pattern with respect to the heat source. There further is the advantage that wiring loads can be well balance if the types and routes of wiring lines between the differential input signals and the differential output signals are uniformized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A differential signal transmission system according to the first aspect of the invention comprises a differential signal output circuit provided with a differential input unit into which differential signals are entered; a current supply unit for supplying a current to the differential input unit; and a capacitor connected between a connection node between the differential input unit and the current supply unit and a low impedance node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A differential signal transmission system according to the second aspect of the invention comprises a differential signal output circuit provided with a differential input unit into which differential signals are entered; a first current supply unit for supplying a current to the differential input unit; and a capacitor connected between a connection node between the differential input unit and the first current supply unit and a second current supply unit having a current supply capacity equal to or greater than the amperage supplied by the first current supply unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A differential signal transmission system according to the third aspect of the invention comprises a differential signal output circuit provided with a first differential input unit configured in a first conductivity type transistor for receiving differential signals; a first current supply unit for supplying a current to the first differential input unit; a second differential input unit configured in a second conductivity type transistor, of which differential output terminals are connected to the differential output terminals of the first differential input unit and the differential signals received; a second current input unit for supplying a current to the second differential input unit; and a capacitor connected between a connection node between the first differential input unit and the first current input unit and another connection node between the second differential input unit and the second current input unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The differential signal transmission systems according to the first through third aspect of the present invention can obtain stable differential output signals even during high speed differential input signal switching keeping free of voltage overshooting and voltage undershooting the differential output signals responding to the differential input signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> To achieve the aforementioned object, a signal detection apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention is configured of a level detection unit for detecting the voltage amplitude level of input signals; a state transition detection unit for detecting any state transition in the output signals of the level detection unit; a signal confirmation unit for issuing a notification signal when the state transition detection unit has detected state transitions a prescribed number of times during a first prescribed length of time; a non-signal confirmation unit for issuing a notification signal when the state transition detection unit has detected no state transition during a second prescribed length of time; and a detect signal generation unit for generating a detect signal that is validated by the signal confirmation unit and invalidated by the non-signal confirmation unit. The &ldquo;non-signal&rdquo; in this context means a state in which no input signal is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A signal detection method according to the first aspect of the invention comprises a level detection step of detecting the voltage amplitude level of input signals; a state transition detection step of detecting any state transition in the input signals detected at the level detection step; a signal confirmation step of notifying the detection of state transitions a prescribed number of times during a first prescribed length of time at the state transition detection step; a non-signal confirmation step of notifying the detection of no state transition during a second prescribed length of time at the state transition detection step; and a detect signal generation step of generating a detect signal that is validated at the signal confirmation step and invalidated at the non-signal confirmation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the signal detection apparatus and the signal detection method, if any state transition is detected on the basis of the voltage amplitude level of detected input signals, a notification signal of signal confirmation is issued when state transitions have been detected a prescribed number of times during the first prescribed length of time, or if no state transition is detected during the second prescribed length of time, a notification signal of non-signal confirmation is issued. A detect signal that is validated by the notification signal of signal confirmation and in validated by the notification signal of non-signal confirmation is issued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In this way, the circuitry for the detection of signal state transition, confirmation of signals, confirmation of non-signals and generation of detect signals can be configured of logic circuits except the part for comparing the voltage amplitude level of input signals with a prescribed voltage level, and accordingly the circuit operation can be realized with reduced current consumption if a digital integrated circuit, such as a CMOS-LSI, is used. Thus, less power consuming operation can be achieved with a system using either the signal detection apparatus or the signal detection method according to the invention. Where this system is used in a battery-powered system such as portable equipment, it will prove suitable for continuous use for many hours, help solve the problem of heat generating in IC packaging, and thereby make possible high density mounting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The first and second prescribed lengths of time for signal confirmation and non-signal confirmation can be appropriately set in accordance with the detection period standard allocated for signal detection, and it is not absolutely necessary to accomplish signal detection in a length of time matching the high signal transfer speed. Therefore, the first and second prescribed lengths of time can be set longer than the length of time matching the high signal transfer speed, and a system using either the signal detection apparatus or the signal detection method can realize operation with reduced current consumption. This system is suitable for use as a battery-powered system such as portable equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Where any state transition of input signals occurs within a prescribed period according to a standard of signal transmission, the maximum time span in which state transitions are repeated is determined, and accordingly the maximum time span in which state transitions are detected a prescribed number of times in signal detection is determined. Therefore, system using either the signal detection apparatus or the signal detection method according to the invention, it is possible to accurately judge whether an input is a valid signal or noise according to whether or not signals are detected a prescribed number of times during the maximum time span. Signal detection can be accomplished with a simple circuit configuration with reduced current consumption without requiring a circuit for carrying out signal detection by sampling in a short period matching the high signal transfer speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A signal transmission system according to the first aspect of the invention comprises a serial bus; a level detection unit, connected on the serial bus, for detecting the voltage amplitude level of input signals from the serial bus; a state transition detection unit for detecting any state transition in the output signals of the level detection unit; a signal confirmation unit for issuing a notification signal when the state transition detection unit has detected state transitions a prescribed number of times during a first prescribed length of time; a non-signal confirmation unit for issuing a notification signal when the state transition detection unit has detected no state transition during a second prescribed length of time; and a detect signal generation unit for generating a detect signal that is validated by the signal confirmation unit and invalidated by the non-signal confirmation unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the signal transmission system, a signal detection apparatus detects the voltage amplitude level of input signals from the serial bus and transmits signals over the serial bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Since this configuration enables the signal detection apparatus to be constituted of a digital IC, such a CMOS-LSI, circuit operation can be realized with reduced current consumption. The first and second prescribed lengths of time for signal confirmation and non-signal confirmation can be appropriately set in accordance with the detection period standard allocated for signal detection on the serial bus, and it is not absolutely necessary to accomplish signal detection in a length of time matching the high signal transfer speed. The first and second prescribed lengths of time can be set longer than the length of time matching the high signal transfer speed, and a serial bus using the signal detection apparatus can realize operation with reduced current consumption. Where any state transition of input signals occurs within a prescribed period according to a standard of signal transmission on a serial bus, the maximum time span in which state transitions are repeated is determined, and accordingly the maximum time span in which state transitions are detected a prescribed number of times in signal detection is determined. It is possible to accurately judge whether an input is a valid signal or noise according to whether or not signals are detected a prescribed number of times during the maximum time span. A signal transmission system capable of reliable signal detection can be realized with reduced current consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A computer-readable program according to the first aspect of the invention executes signal transmission on a serial bus by a signal detection method comprising a level detection step of detecting the voltage amplitude level of input signals; a state transition detection step of detecting any state transition in the input signals detected at the level detection step; a signal confirmation step of notifying the detection of state transitions a prescribed number of times during a first prescribed length of time at the state transition detection step; a non-signal confirmation step of notifying the detection of no state transition during a second prescribed length of time at the state transition detection step; and a detect signal generation step of generating a detect signal that is validated at the signal confirmation step and invalidated at the non-signal confirmation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the computer-readable program, if any state transition is detected on the basis of the voltage amplitude level of detected input signals, a notification signal of signal confirmation is issued when state transitions have been detected a prescribed number of times during the first prescribed length of time, or if no state transition is detected during the second prescribed length of time, a notification signal of non-signal confirmation is issued. A detect signal that is validated by the notification signal of signal confirmation and invalidated by the notification signal of non-signal confirmation is issued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, as a step for executing the signal detection method when signal transmission is to be accomplished on the serial bus is stored in the computer-readable program, the sequence of steps can be easily executed by executing this program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because the sequence of steps can be stored in the computer-readable program, it can be recorded on various recording media or flexibly distributed and installed via a telecommunication line such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The above and further objects and novel features of the invention will more fully appear from the following detailed description when the same is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> First and second embodiments in which a differential signal output apparatus and a semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus having the differential signal output apparatus according to the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Also, third and fourth embodiments in which a signal detection apparatus, a signal detection method and a computer-readable program according to the invention will be described in detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. Further an example of differential signal transmission system according to the invention will be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, and so will be an example of signal transmission system configuration according to the invention with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In a differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A in the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is further provided between the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in addition to the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the prior art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, loads to be connected to the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX in the differential signal transmission system are also represented. Thus, resistance loads RL connected to the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX and a capacitance load CL connected between the resistance load RL and the ground voltage GND constitute a load circuit. Further, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, as circuitry examples of the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor to each of whose gate terminals a control voltage is inputted can be used. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, as a circuitry example of capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the gate capacitance of the NMOS transistor can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Out of the differential input signals to the differential input terminals IP and IM, if the voltage level of the signal to the differential input terminal IP is higher than that to the differential input terminal IM, a transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> out of the PMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constituting the first differential pair will be turned off, and the transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, turned on. Out of the NMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constituting the second differential pair, the transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be turned on, and the transistor Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, turned off. Therefore, the regular current path these two differential pairs constitute raises the voltage level at the differential output terminal OUTX from the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the PMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, the current supplied to the differential output terminal OUTX from the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> flows to the ground voltage GND via the two resistance loads RL from the differential output terminal OUT and via the NMOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As the differential output terminal OUT undergoes current subtraction, and takes on a lower voltage level than that of the differential output terminal OUTX to which a current is supplied. As a result, differential output signals which raises the differential output terminal OUTX to a high level is supplied to the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX. If the voltage level of the signal to the differential input terminal IP is lower than the voltage level of the signal to the differential input terminal IM, a similar action can be caused to take place by reversing the voltage relationship, and differential output signals to raise the differential output terminal OUT to a high level is outputted. What has been described so far is the operation of the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A in a regular state in which the relationship as to the signal voltage level is not reversed between the differential input terminals IP and IM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next will be described a case in which the relationship as to the signal voltage level is reversed between the differential input terminals IP and IM. In the circuit configuration illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, all of the MOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>/Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constituting the first and second differential pairs may go off during the switching period of signals to the differential input terminals IP and IM depending on some conditions including the power supply voltage VDD, the threshold voltages of the MOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, voltage drops at the first and second current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the voltage levels of differential input signals. Also, differences in element characteristics of the constituting transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> due to fluctuations in manufacturing or differences in propagation delay of propagating signals ensuing from parasitic resistances, parasitic capacitances and so forth on the signal wiring or the like of the differential input terminals IP and IM may give rise to lags in response characteristics at the time of switching, with the result that at least one of the PMOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the first differential pair or of the transistors Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constituting the second differential pair goes off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> If this happens, the regular current path will be cut off. However, as the first and second current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> continue to flow constant currents all the time, the currents keep on flowing to the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to which the first and second current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected even though the regular current path is cut off. If there were no capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the current from the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> would flow to the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and, by charging a capacitance component connected to the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, transitionally raises the voltage at the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, the current to the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will flow out of the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and, by discharging a capacitance component connected to the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, transitionally brings down the voltage at the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected between the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A in the first embodiment, a transitional current can be flowed via the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the current path is transitionally cut off at the time the signals to the differential input terminals IP and IM are switched. This transitional current flows only during the transitional switching period of the differential input signals applied to the differential input terminals IP and IM, and it is an alternating current having a frequency component. The capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, because of its element characteristics, has an impedance in inverse proportion to the frequency of the transitional current that flows in. Therefore, by appropriately regulating the impedance of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the frequency component of the transitional current, i.e. the duration of the cut-off state of the current path at the time of switching, the impedance of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be set low relative to the transitional current having a specific frequency component so that the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can sufficiently flow the transitional current. Since the amperages of the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are set equal here because of the symmetry of the circuit actions of the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, the transitional current flowing from the first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the capacitor is well balanced, and neither charges nor discharges the capacitance components connected to the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, so that no transitional voltage variations occur at the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Therefore, voltage overshooting and undershooting at the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX which would result from such voltage variations can be restrained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The impedance of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be calculated by the following equation, with the transitional cut-off duration of the current path during differential input signal switching being supposed to be period of the transitional current pulse flowing to the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>XC&equals;</italic></highlight>1/(2<highlight><italic>&pgr;fC</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> where f is the frequency component, and C, the capacitance of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. By setting this impedance Xc sufficiently small relative to the resistance loads RL&times;2 of the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A (Xc&lt;&lt;RL&times;2), voltage variations emerging at the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be restrained to an almost negligible level. Since voltage variations emerging at the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during the transitional cut-off of the current path, after they shift as they are to the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX, are connected by the resistance loads RL&times;2 to determine the peak voltages of voltage overshooting/undershooting according to the prior art, connection of the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a sufficiently small impedance Xc relative to the resistance loads RL&times;2 almost eliminates voltage variations at the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i.e. voltage overshooting/undershooting at the differential output terminals. Incidentally, the duration of the current path can be easily computed by circuit simulation or otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a specific example of the first embodiment. The basic circuit connection is the same as that in the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A in the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The first current source C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constitutes a first current mirror circuit with the PMOS transistor C<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the second current source C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constitutes a second current mirror circuit with the NMOS transistor C<highlight><bold>02</bold></highlight>. The first current mirror circuit and the second current mirror circuit are so configured that the same amperages are caused to flow therein by the connection of the PMOS transistor C<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight> and the NMOS transistor C<highlight><bold>02</bold></highlight>, and the first and second current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> supply the same amperages. The gate terminal VR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the second current mirror circuit is made adjustable to make the amperage variable. The MOS transistor C<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>02</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constituting the first and second current sources and the back gate terminals of the MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constituting first and second differential pairs are connected to the power supply voltage VDD (where PMOS transistors are used) and to the ground voltage GND (where NMOS transistors are used). The capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected between the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The resistance loads RL and RLX are connected to the differential output terminals TPB and TPBX, respectively; the other ends of the resistance loads RL and RLX are connected in common to the capacitance load CL; and the other end of the capacitance load CL is connected to the ground voltage GND. The parameters of the constituent elements are listed in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows the result of transition analysis with a spice simulator using a Bsim3 model, with the power supply voltage VDD being supposed to be 3.3 V and the differential input signal to be a trapezoidal wave without skewing of 500 MHz in the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> having the parameters of Table 1. The wave forms are those of the differential output signals supplied from the differential output terminals TPB and TPBX. For supplementary information, the waveforms of differential output signals resulting from the simulation of the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, deprived of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It is seen from the waveforms of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> that, at the time of differential output signal switching, voltage overshooting by about 60 mV occurs in a transition from the low to the high level and a voltage undershooting by about 120 mV, in a transition from the high to the low level. It is also seen that the voltage pulse period of voltage overshooting/undershooting is about 250 psec and the frequency is about 4 GHz. By contrast, it is seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> that, in the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A in the first embodiment with the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the transitional current path added thereto, the voltage overshooting is restrained to 40 mV or less and the voltage undershooting, to &minus;30 mV or less. The capacitance of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> here is 10 pF, and the impedance of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a frequency of 4 GHz is: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Xc</italic></highlight>(4 GHz)&equals;1/(2&pgr;&times;4 GHz&times;10 pF)&ap;4 &OHgr;</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> It is seen that, as the resistance load RL of each of the differential output terminals TPB and TPBX is 55 &OHgr;, the impedance of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is sufficient relative to RL&times;2&equals;112 &OHgr;. For this reason, the voltage overshooting/undershooting which would arise with the resistance load of 112 &OHgr; according to the prior art can be sufficiently reduced with the 4 &OHgr; impedance of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Where the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A in the first embodiment is to be laid out as a semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it is preferable to symmetrically arrange the MOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constituting the first and second differential pairs. Further it is preferable to symmetrically arrange the first and second current sources C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as well. It is also preferable to symmetrically arrange the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in an area surrounded by the MOS transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through Q<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constituting the first and second differential pairs. It is preferable here to configure the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> both of MOS capacitors CM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using the gate capacitance of a MOS transistor which can secure a large capacitance relative to the area it occupies and a parallel planar type capacitor CP which permits accurate capacitance setting through the area efficiency of the capacitance is not so high. This makes possible accurate configuration of a capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the minimized area by first setting roughly a capacitance with the MOS capacitors CM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and finely adjusting the capacitance with the parallel planar capacitor CP. It is preferable to have the arrangement reflect consideration for symmetry by, for instance disposing a parallel planar capacitor CP between the MOS capacitors CM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a view to greater accuracy. The expression &ldquo;parallel planar&rdquo; in the parallel planar capacitor CP here refers to a configuration by appropriate combination of constituent elements of a semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus, such as a combination of a diffusion layer and a metal layer or a combination of metal layers alone. Although the parallel planar capacitor CP is arranged with the MOS capacitors CM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and CM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on its two sides in the pattern illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, obviously the relationship between the two kinds of constituent elements can be reversed, i.e. with an MOS capacitor arranged in the center, to achieve the same effect only if the relationship can maintain the symmetry of arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Symmetric arrangement here can set off unevenness of conditions among different constituent elements in the manufacturing process due to differences in diffusion concentration and in sheet resistance of wiring layers ensuing from the disturbance of ion implantation quantity and differences in thickness of inter-layer insulating films resulting from micro-heterogeneity of chemical reactions, so that differences in characteristics among elements due to fluctuations in manufacturing can be minimized. Furthermore, if there is any heat generation accompanying the circuit actions of the semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus, there may arise a so-called temperature gradient, i.e. differences in temperature with the position on the chip relative to the heat source on the semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus. In such a case, if the layout pattern is symmetric with respect to the heat source, it is possible to let the different constituent elements operate with similar temperature characteristics. In the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, if the heat source is above or below the surface of the drawing, the temperature characteristics of the different constituent elements can be equalized. </paragraph>

Therefore, at the timing for each of the other constituent transistors of the first and second differential pairs to come on with the completion of differential input signal switching, in this specific example of the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX (TPB and TPBX in the specific example of the first embodiment), neither voltage overshooting nor voltage undershooting arises. Stable differential output signals can be obtained even if the differential input signals are switched at high speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As the impedance Xc of the capacitor CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to flow a transitional current at the time of transitional response here is smaller than the load impedance RL&times;2, voltage variations at the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be effectively restrained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> By symmetrically arranging the elements constituting the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, unevenness of characteristics among the constituent elements can be kept to the minimum, and equaling the lengths of wiring between the differential input signals and between the differential output signals makes it possible to minimize differences in propagation delay among the differential signals.

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured of an analog circuit. The differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; are entered into this voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which supplies a high level output signal L in response to differential inputs IN&plus; or IN&minus; representing a difference in voltage amplitude level of or above a prescribed value.

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Hereupon, P1394b will be explained as an example of signal transmission standard. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the parameters of timing at which the signal-detect signal SD is outputted under the P1394b standard. The standard includes provisions on the delay time from the detection of a valid signal until the assertion of the signal-detect signal SD (t_sd_on) and the detection of an invalid signal until the negation of the signal-detect signal SD (t_sd_off), and prescribes 100 &mgr;sec as the maximum for each. The detection of a valid signal here can be set as the detection of the edge detect signal EDG a prescribed number of times, and this first prescribed length of time can be regarded as the delay time t_sd_on. Thus if the edge detect signal EDG is detected a prescribed number of times within the delay time t_sd_on, the signal-detect signal SD can be asserted. The detection of an invalid signal can be set as the failure to detect the edge detect signal EDG, and the second prescribed length of time then can be regarded as the delay time t_sd_off. Thus, if no edge detect signal EDG is detected within the delay time t_sd_off, the signal-detect signal SD can be negated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Code tables of 8b10b codes, which constitute the coding system used under the P1394b standard, are presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The 3b10b coding system, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, is a system of coding 8-bit data into codes of 10-bit length. Codes of 10-bit length are transmitted over the transmission path. Coding takes into account the number of bits &ldquo;0&rdquo; and the number of bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; in 10-bit length codes. Two kinds of codes are allocated for each set of 8-bit data, including 10-bit length codes having a greater number of bits &ldquo;0&rdquo; and 10-bit length codes having a greater number of bits &ldquo;1&rdquo;. This is intended to maintain a DC balance in the voltage level on the transmission path. Variations in the DC voltage level on the transmission path are restrained by alternately transmitting a 10-bit length code having more of bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; and a 10-bit length code having more of bits &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Further in order prevent the sensitivity of the transceiver on the transmission path from deteriorating, coding is done not to let the same bit value appear consecutively, and 10-bit length codes are set to allow no more than five bits of the same value to be consecutive in the 10-bit length-coded signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Also, the P1394b standard has a characteristic, distinct from other such standards, that radiation noise of a specific frequency is great on account of the consecutive sending of the same request packet signal in order to secure the right to use the bus. To reduce this noise, 8-bit data are scrambled by a spread spectrum system. In this manner, the same 8-bit data are subjected to arithmetic operation using a specific code to diffuse the bit pattern in a pseudo-at-random way, and the radiation noise is reduced by diffusing it over a wide frequency range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> What follows is a description in specific terms of a case in which the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is applied to the P1394b standard, which is the next generation standard of IEEE 1394. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a specific example of the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This is a basic configuration of a differential circuit based on a differential pair in which the emitter terminals of bipolar transistors are connected. By providing a negative voltage level shift circuit V on the input signal IN&plus; input routes from the transmission path to the base terminal of the differential pair, it is made possible set an offset to the potential difference of the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; between which the output signal of the differential circuit is inverted. This voltage level shift circuit V can set a prescribed value of the voltage amplitude level difference between the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus;. Although the voltage level shift circuit V is denoted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> by a symbol of a voltage source, it can be easily set by, for instance, a configuration in which a resistance element (not shown) is provided on the input route for the input signal IN&plus; from the transmission path, and a constant current is drawn with a constant current source (not shown) via this resistance element from the transmission path. If the insertion of a resistance element does not fit the impedance standard of the input to the differential circuit, it is possible to provide an emitter follower or source follower configuration (not shown) at the input stage, connect the resistance element via this configuration, and shift down the voltage level with the constant current source. Although the output signals are expressed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> as differential signals OUT&plus; and OUT&minus;, a single phase output of a logic level can be obtained by connecting a known circuit configuration to a later stage than the differential output signals OUT&plus; and OUT&minus;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Though the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is configured of a bipolar transistor, obvious it can be constituted of a MOS transistor as well. In this case, if the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D in the first or second embodiment are used as the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, voltage overshooting and voltage undershooting in the differential output signals OUT&plus; and OUT&minus; can be effectively restrained against high speed transition of the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrating a specific example of the signal-detect setting circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The edge detect signal EDG from the leading edge detecting circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to the enable terminal E of a counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and also connected to an the edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The output terminal of the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is entered as an on/off signal into an Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Into the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, not only the clock signal CLK and a set point Nx, but also an output signal for supplying the count is connected to an identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A count &ldquo;0&rdquo; at the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is entered into the identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> as the reference, and the result of identity detection is inputted to one of the input terminals of an OR gate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and at the same time inputted to an inverter gate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. A valid signal-detect signal D is outputted from an AND gate <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> which is connected to the output terminal of the inverter gate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and to the output terminal of an edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The output signal of the edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> here is set in response to the number of times of identity detection by the edge detect signal EDG with a setpoint (not shown) and supplies a high level signal. The valid signal-detect signal D is connected to the other input terminal of the OR gate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and the output terminal of the OR gate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is disposed for inputting to the reset terminal R of the edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and to the reset terminal R of the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The valid signal-detect signal D is entered into an AND gate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> together with a signal deriving from the signal-detect signal SD via an inverter gate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and the signal detect set signal SET is supplied from the AND gate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The operation of the signal-detect setting circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> will be described with reference to state transition diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In the &ldquo;idle&rdquo; state IDL in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, there is a state permitting acceptance of the edge detect signal EDG at its high level. Upon acceptance of a high level edge detect signal EDG here, the state transitions into a state of having accepted the first edge detect signal EDG (first edge). Referring to the circuit diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when a high level edge detect signal EDG is entered, this is matched by the supply of an &ldquo;on&rdquo; signal from the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> This &ldquo;on&rdquo; signal is entered into the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, which takes in the &ldquo;on&rdquo; signal in synchronism with the clock signal CLK and starts counting. From the &ldquo;first edge&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the count increases by 1 at a time in synchronism with the clock signal CLK (from the &ldquo;1&rdquo; state till the &ldquo;Nx&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). The count-up continues until the count becomes identical with the setpoint Nx, when the count is reset to its initial value &ldquo;0&rdquo; at the next clock signal CLK. When the count is initialized to &ldquo;0&rdquo;, the output signal of the identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> takes on a high level, and is entered into the OR gate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to reset the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is placed in a reset state in synchronism with the clock signal CLK of the next cycle. Thus it returns to the idle state IDL. The setpoint Nx here is given from outside the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and can be altered as appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> When the edge detect signal EDG takes on a high level at one of the timings of the count-up operation by the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the leading edge of the output signal of the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is detected, the edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, deciding that the edge has been detected a prescribed number of times (twice in this case), sets the output terminal, and supplies a high level signal. On the way of count-up by the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, the output of the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is a count other than &ldquo;0&rdquo;. Therefore, a signal deriving from the output signal of the identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> via the inverter gate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> maintains a high level. As a result, the valid signal-detect signal D, which is the output signal of the AND gate <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is at a high level. At this point of time, the signal-detect signal SD is at a low level, and the output terminal of the inverter gate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is at a high level. Both input terminals of the AND gate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> take on a high level, and the signal detect set signal SET is set to a high level (the &ldquo;set&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Simultaneously with the outputting of the signal detect set signal SET, the valid signal-detect signal D resets the edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> via the OR gate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is reset in synchronism with the clock signal CLK of the next cycle to initialize the count to &ldquo;0&rdquo;. This count &ldquo;0&rdquo; is recognized for identity detection by the identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which then supplies an output signal of a high level. One of the input signals to the AND gate <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> takes on a low level via the inverter gate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>; the valid signal-detect signal D takes on a low level; and the signal detect set signal SET also returns to a low level. On the other hand, as the high level of the signal detect set signal SET causes the signal-detect signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to raise the signal-detect signal SD to a high level, the output signal of the inverter gate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is fixed to a low level not to accept any more valid signal-detect signal D (the &ldquo;wait&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). If in this state the signal detect reset signal RST, to be described in more detail afterwards, causes the signal-detect signal SD to take on a low level via the signal-detect signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the idle state IDL, in which the edge detect signal EDG can be accepted, will be resumed. To add, though the setpoint of the edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the state transition diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, so that, if the edge detect signal EDG is supplied twice, the output signal is set to output a high level, it is also possible to use a configuration in which the count can be set as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates a specific example of the signal-detect resetting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The valid signal-detect signal is inputted to one of the input terminals of an OR gate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and its output terminal is arranged for inputting to the reset terminal R of a counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. To the enable terminal E of the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is inputted the signal-detect signal SD. The output terminal of the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is disposed for entry of on/off signals into an Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Into the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are entered the clock signal CLK and a setpoint Ny, and the output signal indicating the count is connected to an identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The setpoint Ny is entered into the identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as the reference, and the result of identity detection is connected to the other input terminal of the OR gate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and supplied as the signal detect reset signal RST. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The operation of the signal-detect resetting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> will be described with reference to the state transition diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In the idle state IDL of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, when a high level signal-detect signal SD is entered into the enable terminal E, the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> supplies an &ldquo;on&rdquo; signal to the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, and a state of having detected a signal (the &ldquo;signal detect&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>) is reached. After this &ldquo;on&rdquo; signal, the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> starts counting in synchronism with the clock signal CLK that is entered into the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. From the &ldquo;signal detect&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the count increases by 1 at a time in synchronism with the clock signal CLK (from the &ldquo;1&rdquo; state till the &ldquo;Ny&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). The count-up continues until the count becomes identical with the setpoint Ny, when the identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> supplies the signal detect reset signal RST. The signal detect reset signal RST resets the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> via the OR gate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, and supplies an &ldquo;off&rdquo; signal to the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> as the output signal of the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is reset and returns to the idle state IDL. The setpoint Ny here is given from outside the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, and can be altered as appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When the valid signal-detect signal D takes on a high level at one of the timings of the count-up operation by the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, and a valid signal is detected by the signal-detect setting circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is reset via the OR gate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is reset, and state of having detected a signal (the &ldquo;signal detect&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>) is resumed. In this case, as the signal-detect signal SD is at a high level, the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, again placed in the &ldquo;enable&rdquo; state, supplies an &ldquo;on&rdquo; signal from the output terminal to the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. In synchronism with the clock signal CLK, the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, after being reset, resumes the count-up operation (the &ldquo;signal detect&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 19</cross-reference> are time charts of the operational sequences of the signal-detect signal SD shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 16</cross-reference>.

To add, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference> illustrate a case in which the leading edge of the output signal L of the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is detected in synchronism with the switching cycle of the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus;, wherein the period of the clock signal CLK for the counting by the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is synchronized with the switching cycle of the input signals. Signal detection here covers only the cases in which the input signal IN&plus; is at a higher level than the input signal IN&minus;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Signal (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows a case in which the cycle in which the potential difference between the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; reaches a prescribed value occurs in only one bit length. When the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; have come to manifest a prescribed voltage difference, the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supplies an output signal L of a high level, and the leading edge detecting circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supplies the edge detect signal EDG. This places the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the enable state, actuating the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to start counting up. However, because no succeeding edge is detected with a prescribed length of time Xns, which is a period for counting Nx times, the output signal of the edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> maintains a low level, but no valid signal-detect signal D is set. Therefore, the signal detect set signal SET is not set, and the signal-detect signal SD maintains a low level. As the output signal of the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> takes on a low level after counting Nx, the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is reset via an inverter gate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and an &ldquo;off&rdquo; signal is delivered to the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The count-up action is stopped upon resetting of the count, and the idle state IDL is resumed. only one bit has been judged valid in the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus;, and no succeeding signal is detected. Therefore, what appears to be a detect signal of one bit length obtained here is judged to be noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Signals (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> represent a case in which the potential difference between the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; has surpassed a prescribed value for two bits with one bit intervening between them. When the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; manifest a prescribed voltage difference, the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> gives an output signal L of a high level, and the leading edge detecting circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supplies the edge detect signal EDG. At the first bit the edge detect signal EDG is supplied, and the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is placed in the enable state, actuating the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to start counting up. At the next bit but one, the edge detect signal EDG is again given. As the interval between the leading edges of two bits with one intervening bit between them is usually short enough relative to the P1394b standard on the t_ad_on time, it can be considered a length of time within the prescribed length of time Xns for counting Nx times. Therefore, the output signal of the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> maintains a high level and, with the output signal of the inverter gate <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> continuing to maintain a high level, the output signal of the edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also takes on a high level. If the valid signal-detect signal D is set and the signal-detect signal SD is not to set to a high level, the signal-detect signal SD will be set to a high level. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the clock signal CLK synchronized with the leading edges of the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; causes the signal-detect signal SD to be set in synchronism with a second output signal L. As the signal-detect signal SD is already entered into the AND gate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> via the inverter gate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the valid signal-detect signal D is masked by the AND gate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and no subsequent valid signal-detect signal D can be accepted. In the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus;, the leading edges of two bits with one intervening bit between them can be detected, and as this edge interval is a length of time within the prescribed length of time Xns for counting Nx times, it is judged that a valid signal has been detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Signals (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> represent a case in which, though two bits of the cycle in which the potential difference between the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; reaches a prescribed value are detected, the time interval is not within the prescribed length of time Xns for the counting of Nx by the Nx counter. Whereas the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> starts counting up the output signal L, which is signal (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), the Nx counter completes counting Nx before the edge detect signal EDG, which is the next signal (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). Therefore, the output count of the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, resulting in a high level of the output of the identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The edge counter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the counter control circuit {circle over (1)} <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are reset via the OR gate <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to reset the count of the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the operation is stopped to return to the idle state IDL. Accordingly, what appears to be signal (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) of an output signal L is judged to be noise. Incidentally, output signal (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is detected as a valid signal if its time interval from the preceding output signal L is not longer than Xns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Signal (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> represents a case in which the cycle for the potential difference between the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; to reach a prescribed value has two consecutive bits, and in signal (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) the cycle has more than two consecutive bits. As a 1-bit equivalent of inverted signal intervenes between the two signals, the edge interval between signals (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) is three bits long. As the leading edge interval between these bits is usually short enough relative to the P1394b standard on the t_sd_on time, it can be considered a length of time within the prescribed length of time Xns for counting Nx times. Therefore, a leading edge attributable to the second bit signal is detected on the way of counting by the Nx counter having started counting up upon the detection of the first edge, and it is judged that a valid signal has been detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The operation of the signal-detect resetting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is in a state of having detected a signal (the &ldquo;signal detect&rdquo; state in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>) because the signal-detect signal SD is at a high level. Then the valid signal-detect signal D detected by signal (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and the preceding signal of signal (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is entered, and the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is reset. The Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> resumes counting up after its count is reset. It is at the timing of the detection of the leading edge of signal (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) as mentioned above that the valid signal-detect signal D is entered again. If after the restart of the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> by signal (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) a prescribed length of time Yns in which the count reaches Ny has not been attained, the count is less than Ny, and there is no detection of identity with the setpoint Ny. Therefore, no signal detect reset signal RST is supplied, the counter control circuit {circle over (2)} <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> resets the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to restart counting the prescribed length of time Yns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Signals (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> represent a case in which the time interval in which the potential difference between the differential input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; reaches a prescribed value does not exist in the prescribed length of time Xns for the counting of Nx by the Nx counter. As in the case of signals (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, what appears to be signal (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) is judged to be noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Since signal (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) is judged to be noise, it is at the timing of signal (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) that the signal-detect signal SD is supplied. Therefore, the count of the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is reset by signal (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>), and counting is resumed. Since what appears to be signal (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) that is detected in the meantime is judged to be noise and no output signal L is detected either, the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> continues counting up until the setpoint Ny. When the count has reached Ny, the signal detect reset signal RST, which is the output signal of the identity detection circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, comes out at a high level, and the signal-detect signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> resets the signal-detect signal SD. Actions for failure to detect a signal takes place because no valid signal has been detected within the prescribed length of time Yns. </paragraph>

If the flows charted here are incorporated into a program, the method can be executed by the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as well. In this case, the program is recorded in the memory <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and/or the magnetic disk unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or if recorded on the external memory medium <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such as a CD-ROM or a magnetic medium, will be recorded via the external memory medium drive unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and further via a telecommunication line such as the Internet (not shown) into the memory <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and/or the magnetic disk unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or directly transferred to the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The flows of the signal detection method will be described below in specific terms with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> charts the flow of setting the signal-detect signal SD. At processing step (hereinafter abbreviated to S) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the presence of the leading edge of the signal waveform based on the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; entered from the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or via a communication interface is checked (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>:NO), and if it is detected (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>:YES) the edge detection count is increased by 1 at a time (S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). If then the Nx counter for measuring the prescribed length of time for edge detection is not counting (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>:NO), it starts counting (S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) to return to the edge detection state (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). If it is counting (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>:YES), it further judges whether or not edge detection has reached the prescribed number of times (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). If the prescribed number of times has not been reached (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>: NO), the count of the Nx counter is determined (S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). If the Nx count has been reached (S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>: YES), the edge counter is reset (S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and the Nx counter is also reset (S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). If the Nx count has not been reached (S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>:NO), detection of the leading edge is continued as it has been (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> If edge detection has reached the prescribed number of times (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>:YES), the entered signal is judged to be a valid input signal and the valid signal-detect signal D is supplied (S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) to reset the edge counter (S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) and also to reset the Nx counter (S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). Next it is judged whether or not the signal-detect signal SD is set (S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). If the signal-detect signal SD is not set (S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>:NO), the signal detect set signal SET is set (S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). If it is set (S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>:YES), the signal detect set signal SET need not be set, the leading edge detection state is resumed to detect the next valid signal-detect signal D (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> charts the flow of resetting the signal-detect signal SD. At S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is checked whether or not the signal-detect signal SD is supplied (S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>:NO) and, if this signal is detected (S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>:YES), the Ny counter for measuring the prescribed length of time to judge non-detection of the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; starts counting up (S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). It is judged whether or not the valid signal-detect signal D is detected, which would indicate detection of a valid signal during the count-up operation (S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). If it is detected (S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>:YES), the Ny counter is reset (S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) and counting is restarted (S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). If it is not detected (S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>:NO), the count of the Ny counter is further checked (S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). If the Ny count has not been reached (S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>:NO), the process returns to the S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of valid signal-detect signal D detection to continue the detection attempt. If the Ny count is reached (S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>:YES), the signal detect reset signal RST is set (S<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>), and the Ny counter is reset (S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) to complete the flow of signal-detect signal SD resetting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As hither to described in detail, in the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the signal detection method in the third embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>), the leading edge detecting circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for detecting any state transition of the output signal L of the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the signal-detect setting circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for signal confirmation, the signal-detect resetting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for non-signal confirmation and the signal-detect signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for generating detect signals can be configured of logic circuits except the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for comparing the voltage amplitude level of the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; with a prescribed voltage REF. Accordingly the circuit operation can be realized with reduced current consumption if a digital integrated circuit, such as a CMOS-LSI, is used. Less power consuming operation can be realized in the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the signal detection method in the third embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>). Where this system is used in a battery-powered system such as portable equipment, it will prove suitable for continuous use for many hours, ease the problem of heat generating in IC packaging, and thereby make possible high density mounting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The count frequencies and setpoints (Nx and Ny) of the Nx and Ny counters <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for setting first and second prescribed lengths of time for signal confirmation and non-signal confirmation can be appropriately set in accordance with the detection period standard allocated for signal detection, and it is not absolutely necessary to accomplish signal detection in a length of time matching the high signal transfer speed. Therefore, the clock signal CLK for determining the count frequencies of the Nx and Ny counters can be caused to operate at a low frequency relative to the high signal transfer speed. A high frequency clock circuit or the like, such as a PLL circuit, which would be required if the operation should match the signal transfer speed can be dispensed with. Less power consuming operation can be realized in the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the signal detection method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>). These systems can be suitably used in a battery-powered system such as portable equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Especially under the P1394b standard, whereas high speed transmission standards including the S800 standard calling for 800 Mbps and the S3200 standard calling for 3.2 Gbps are formulated, because the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the signal detection method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>) are realized with a digital integrated circuit such as a CMOS-LSI, less power consuming operation can be realized. Furthermore, it is made possible to integrate circuits into what is known as a system LSI, so that the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the signal detection method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>) in high density packaging, meeting or compliant with the P1394b standard can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Further, the P1394b standard, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, includes provisions on the delay time from the detection of a valid signal until the assertion of the signal-detect signal SD (t_sd_on) and the detection of an invalid signal until the negation of the signal-detect signal SD (t_sd_off), and prescribes 100 &mgr;sec as the maximum for each. Therefore, the count frequencies and setpoints (Nx and Ny) for the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the signal-detect setting circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of the signal-detect resetting circuit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be appropriately set to be compatible with this standard. Thus signal detection can be accomplished at a lower frequency relative to the high signal transfer speed of the S800 or S3200 standard. A high frequency circuit, such as a PLL circuit, which would be required if the operation should match the signal transfer speed can be dispensed with, and less power consuming operation can be realized. These systems can be suitably used in a battery-powered system such as portable equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Further, the P1394b standard calls for 8b10b coding for signal transmission. In 8b10b coding, no more than five bits of the same bit value appear consecutively in 10-bit length codes propagating over a transmission path. Therefore, the maximum length of time in which any state transition occurs at the time of bit value switching is determined. For instance under the S800 standard (800 Mbps), the bit length is 1 ns because bit signals of 1 Gbps are transmitted after coding, and the maximum length of time in which any state transition occurs is 5 ns (200 MHz). Thus, during an attempt at signal detection, if no state transition is detected within the maximum length of time (5 ns under the S800 standard), the seeming input signal in which the first state transition is detected can be judged to be noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the standard on the transmission of 8b10b-coded signals any state transition of input signals can occur within the prescribed period of no longer than five bits and the maximum length of time in which state transition is repeated is determined. As the number of state transitions (count Nx) that can be detected by the leading edge detecting circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is the detector, within a period of time counted by the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, which is the first time counter, is determined, by using the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, or the signal detection method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>), it is possible to accurately judge whether or not a seeming input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus; is a valid signal or noise by checking whether or not a prescribed number of state transitions are detected within a first prescribed length of time, which is the delay time (t_sd_on) from the detection of a valid signal until the assertion of the signal-detect signal SD according to the P1394b standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Or if signal detection is carried out by detecting any state transition with respect to a prescribed combination of the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus;, there is no need to have all the signals transmitted at a high signal transfer speed samples by the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or at the level detection step for detecting the voltage amplitude level of the input signals IN&plus; and IN&minus;. Accordingly, the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the level detection step can be configured to operate at a lower speed than the signal transfer speed, and this feature enables less power consuming operation to be realized. It can be suitably used in a battery-powered system such as portable equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In particular under the P1394b standard, in the code tables of 8b10b codes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, two kinds of codes are allocated for each set of 8-bit data, including a 10-bit length code pattern having a greater number of bits &ldquo;0&rdquo; and a 10-bit length code pattern having, conversely, a greater number of bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; with a view to maintaining a DC balance in the voltage level on the transmission path. Among the 10-bit length codes, the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or the level detection step involves <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> patterns in which the bit length of bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; including the leading edge is not consecutive (patterns in bold italic characters in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>). They include 12 patterns in which the number of bits &ldquo;0&rdquo; and the number of bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; are equal (patterns in shadowed bold italic characters in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>). In each of these 12 patterns, mutually inverse bits &ldquo;0&rdquo; and bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; are paired to match one set of 8-bit data. Therefore, before coding, they are six patterns of 8-bit data, i.e. 8-bit data patterns of <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, AAh, ACh and ADh. In the 34 patterns remaining after the subtraction of these 12 out of the total of 46 patterns, the number of bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; is smaller than that of bits &ldquo;0&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the foregoing, 10-bit length codes to be transmitted in accordance with the P1394b standard will be discussed. Since there are two kinds for 10-bit length codes for each set of 8-bit data, the number of 10-bit length codes is 256&times;2&equals;512. Since only 46 codes out of this total are codes in which bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; do not appear consecutively, the number of codes in which bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; appear consecutively for a 2-bit length or more is 512&minus;46&equals;466. Thus, more than 90% of all the 10-bit length codes have a part in which two or more bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; are consecutive. Further, 34 out of the 46 are codes in which the number of bits &ldquo;0&rdquo; is greater and bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; are not consecutive. However, according to the P1394b standard, in order to maintain a DC balance on the transmission path, the number of bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; is greater in the 10-bit length code to be transmitted next. Thus, a code immediately following any one of the 34 has at least two consecutive bits &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The remaining 12 codes include only six kinds of 8-bit data and account for only 2% of the total of 256 kinds of data. Moreover, as 8-bit data are scrambled by a spread spectrum system, it is unthinkable for any two or more of these six 8-bit patterns to emerge consecutively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Because of the foregoing, if a bit data string of 10-bit length codes in units of an appropriate byte length of two bytes or more each is looked at, the probability of the emergence of a part in which bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; are consecutive is rather high. Considering that the delay time (t_sd_on)until the assertion of the signal-detect signal SD and the delay time (t_sd_off) from the detection of an invalid signal until the negation of the signal-detect signal SD are 100 &mgr;sec each at the maximum under the P1394b standard, a valid signal can be detected without fail by detecting the leading edge when two or more bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; emerge consecutively in a data length of two bytes or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has only to detect a part in which two or more bits &ldquo;1&rdquo; emerge consecutively. By optimizing the detection sensitivity of the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the need to follow a high data transfer speed of the S800 standard or the like is eliminated, and the designing of the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is thereby facilitated, resulting in less current consuming operation by the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which in turn makes important contributions to less power consuming operation by the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> It is sufficient to suitably set the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> for measuring the first and second prescribed lengths of time for signal confirmation and non-signal confirmation in accordance with the standard detection period allocated for signal detection, but signal detection need not be accomplished in a length of time matching a high signal transfer speed. Therefore, the clock signal CLK according to which the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are to operate may be operate at a lower speed than the signal transfer speed, and it is thereby made possible for the Nx counter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the Ny counter <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, which are the first and second time counters in the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or represent the first and second time counting steps in the signal detection method, to operate with reduced current consumption. This arrangement can be suitably used in a battery-powered system such as portable equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and signal detection method in the fourth embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>) can provide the same advantages as the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the third embodiment. In addition, steps for executing a method of detecting valid signals in signal transmission over a serial bus BB (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>) as a computer-readable program, besides being recorded in the memory <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and/or the magnetic disk unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, where they are recorded on the external memory medium <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such as a CD-ROM or a magnetic medium, can be stored into the memory <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or the magnetic disk unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the external memory medium drive unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and further via a telecommunication line such as the Internet (not shown), or directly transferred to the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to be executed as instructed by the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Further by fitting this program to the P1394b standard, the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be made usable as a detection device for valid signals in signal transmission over the serial bus BB meeting or compliant with the P1394b standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, because a sequence of steps (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>) can be stored in a computer-readable program, it can recorded on various recording media or flexibly distributed and installed by recording it on the external memory medium <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> such as a CD-ROM or a magnetic medium or downloading it via a telecommunication line such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Typical systems are described below. An example of differential signal transmission system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> uses the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D in the first and second embodiments as a drive circuit for a twisted pair cable TP under the IEEE <highlight><bold>1394</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>standard. By the use of the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D, it is made possible to provide a differential signal transmission system capable of preventing transitional voltage overshooting and/or voltage undershooting from occurring at the differential output terminals OUT and OUTX during differential input signals switching, and stably transmitting high speed differential signals over the twisted pair cable TP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Another example of signal transmission system configuration illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, using the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the signal detection method (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>) in the third and fourth embodiments as the interface, configures n&plus;1 apparatuses comprising apparatuses A through H (ID&equals;0 through 7) over the serial bus BB and other apparatuses not shown (ID&equals;8 through n) according to the P1394b serial bus system. An interface according to P1394b can configure a system by assigning ID numbers to the constituent apparatuses. In each individual apparatus, the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is configured in the interfacing part with the serial bus BB, and in addition to these apparatuses there is provided as software or firmware an interface for realizing the signal detection method shown in the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>. The presence of these signal detection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the signal detection method in the interfacing part enables each apparatus to detect valid signals out of the signals on the serial bus BB and makes possible communication via the P1394b interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As the signal detection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the signal detection method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>) provided in the interfacing part with the serial bus BB can be configured of logic circuits, the circuit operation with reduced current consumption can be realized for the signal transmission system (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>) if a digital integrated circuit, such as a CMOS-LSI, is used. Where this signal transmission system is used in a battery-powered system such as portable equipment, it will prove suitable for continuous use for many hours, ease the problem of heat generating in IC packaging, and thereby make possible high density mounting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Further, if the standard on the detection time allocated for signal detection on the serial bus BB is satisfied, it is not absolutely necessary for signal detection to be accomplished in a length of time matching a high signal transfer speed. Therefore, the clock signal CLK to determine the count frequencies of the Nx and Ny counters can be caused to operate at a lower frequency relative to the signal transfer speed, and less power consuming operation can be realized in the signal transmission system (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>). This signal transmission system can be suitably used in a battery-powered system such as portable equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> If software or firmware to realize the signal detection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the signal detection method configured in the interfacing part with the other apparatuses (apparatuses A through H and others) with the serial bus BB are constituted to be compatible with the P1394b standard, the signal transmission system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> can be configured as an interface conforming to the P1394b standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> If the serial bus BB in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is configured of a twisted pair cable TP, the interfaces of the apparatuses A through H (ID&equals;0 through 7) and other apparatuses (ID&equals;8 through n) in the signal transmission system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> can be configured of the signal detection apparatuses <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the differential signal output circuits <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. It is further possible to configure the drive circuit for the serial bus BB, such as a twisted pair cable, connected to the voltage level detector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the communication interface <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the signal detection apparatus <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the differential signal output circuits <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above-described first through fourth embodiments, but obviously various improvements and modifications are possible within a scope not deviating from the essentials of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Although the first and second embodiments were described with respect to examples configured of MOS transistor, the invention is not limited to them, but can be similarly applied to examples configured of bipolar transistors or appropriate combinations of MOS transistors and bipolar transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Also, with respect to the first and second embodiments, cases in which the capacitor to constitute a transitional current path is connected to the current source, the power supply voltage or the ground voltage were described, the invention is not limited to these cases, but the capacitor can as well be connected to a low impedance node or a current supply unit having a sufficiently large current supply capacity. For instance, connection to a buffer output such as a source follower or an emitter follower or an internal power source or some other low impedance node can give a similar effect. It is also possible to use a current source in another circuit configuration permitting the flow of a large current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> It is thereby possible to secure a sufficient supply capacity for the transitional current and to securely restrain voltage variations at the connection nodes between differential pairs and current sources. Accordingly, voltage overshooting and/or voltage undershooting at the differential output terminals can be restrained without fail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, with respect to the differential signal output circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the prior art, a case of connecting the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a capacitor in the first embodiment was referred to, it is also possible to connect a first capacitor between the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the ground voltage GND and a second capacitor between the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the power supply voltage VDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Further in the third embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>, the cycle period of the clock signal CLK for counting by the Nx and Ny counters <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are set short relative to the time until the Nx count and the Ny count, which are the respectively prescribed lengths of time, the signal detection apparatus, signal detection method, signal transmission system and computer-readable program according to the invention are not limited to this setting, but the frequency of the clock signal CLK can as well be set low. In this case, the clock signal CLK will operate for signal confirmation or non-signal confirmation after the prescribed lengths of time are reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In the third and fourth embodiments, the configurations are such that the leading edge is detected when the input signal IN&plus; has reached a higher voltage level than the prescribed value relative to the input signal IN&minus;, the invention is not limited to this configuration, but a configuration in which the trailing edge is detected when the input signal IN&plus; has reached a lower voltage level than the prescribed value relative to the input signal IN&minus; is also acceptable, or both edges can as well be made the objects of detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Although a case in which a twisted pair cable is used for the transmission of differential input signals was referred to, the invention is not limited to this, but it can be similarly applied to a case in which a coaxial cable is used or one in which an optical fiber cable is used. In these cases, the input signals may conceivably be single phase signals instead of differential signals or optical signals instead of electrical signals, and to these cases as well the invention is made applicable by providing an input buffer capable of appropriately detecting the levels of input signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Although the P1394b standard was cited with respect to the first through fourth embodiments, this is not the only compatible standard, but obviously the invention can as well be applied to a next generation communication interface for realizing even faster transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a differential signal output apparatus capable of realizing stable high speed differential input signal switching by restraining the voltage overshooting and/or undershooting at differential output terminals due to timing lags of differential input signals owing to lags in response characteristics or differences in wiring delay ensuing from circuit configuration or fluctuations in manufacturing, a semiconductor integrated circuit apparatus and a differential signal transmission system in a next generation digital interface typically represented by P1394b or the like. It is also made possible to provide a signal detection apparatus, a signal detection method, a signal transmission system and a computer-readable program capable of realizing detection of input signals transmitted at high data transfer speed without large current consumption and at low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention. The embodiment chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the invention and its practical application to enable one skilled in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
