<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a conductive material for using in interior coating of a cathode ray tube (CRT), and more particularly, to a conductive material for using in coating a conductive layer on the inner surface of the funnel of a CRT with increased adhesiveness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> CRTs have conductive layers, which serve as an electric condenser, on the outer and inner surfaces of the funnel. The conductive layers formed of a conductive material accelerate electron beams towards a phosphor screen at a high voltage, and gather secondary electrons emitted from the shadow mask, magnetic shield, and phosphor screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The conductive material used to form the conductive layers includes graphite, a binder, and a dispersing agent. The conductive material further include a metal oxide to increase elastic resistance. A conductive layer formed of the conductive material, and a CRT adopting the conductive layer are obtained as follows. The conductive material is coated on the inner or outer surface of a funnel by a spraying or deposition technique, or by means of a brush or sponge. The coated conductive layer is dried and sintered in the air. The funnel having the conductive layer and a panel having a phosphor screen on its inner surface are sealed at a temperature of about 450&deg; C. using a glass having a low melting point. An electron gun which emits electron beams is equipped into the neck portion of the funnel, and the resultant structure is hot evacuated to complete a vacuum CRT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since the conductive layer coated on the inner surface of the funnel of a CRT adsorbs moisture and a variety of gases in the air, the adsorbed gases are removed from the conductive layer by hot evacuation before sealing of the CRT. However, although such evacuation is carried out, the adsorbed gas which still remains in the conductive layer is released during operation of the CRT, which causes undesirable reactions with the cathode of the CRT, thereby degrading the cathode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the conductive layer may partially laminate from the inner surface of the funnel in the manufacture of a CRT. As a result, arc discharging of the electron gun, or current leakage occurs during operation of the CRT. Such arc discharging or current leakage damages high-voltage stability of the CRT. For this reason, there is a need to form a conductive layer such that the conductive layer remains intact on the funnel against external vibration or impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. sho 55-2042; hei 3-59542; and sho 63-45428 disclose use of a metal oxide formed of iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), aluminum (Al), or silicon (Si) as an additive to a conductive material for the conductive layer of a CRT. Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 63-45428 discloses a method of uniformly dispersing negatively and positively charged particles in a negatively charged dispersion medium, in which negatively charged graphite particles and positively charged metal oxide particles such as titanium dioxide (TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are agglomerated together, and negatively charged silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) particles are dispersed around the particle complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. sho 61-20990 discloses a method of increasing adhesiveness of the conductive layer formed on the inner side of a CRT funnel by addition of silicon carbide particles as well as graphite particles. U.S. Pat. No. 4,479,824 discloses use of a silicon monomer as well as graphite particles to suppress separation of the conductive layer from a CRT funnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. sho 52-52362 and sho 63-45428 disclose use of lithium silicate, potassium silicate, or sodium silicate as a binder of conductive layer. Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. hei 3-141539 discloses use of a cement, which less adsorbs moisture or gases, as a binder of a conductive layer. Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. sho 63-114025 discloses addition of a metal hydride which can adsorb and desorb gases to a conductive material of conductive layer. Japanese Patent Application No. hei 6-093079 discloses use of potassium silicate, which less adsorbs moisture or gases, as a binder of conductive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The conductive layers formed by the above-described methods are unsatisfactory, and need an improvement in terms of adhesiveness to the inner surface of the funnel. In addition, in the case where the conductive layers are left in the air after sintering, there is a need to extend a period of time for which hot evacuation is performed to exhaust the adsorbed moisture or carbonic acid gas, which lowers productivity of CRTs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A conductive material for use in interior coating of a cathode ray tube (CRT) according to the present invention is characterized in that potassium silicate having a silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) to potassium oxide (K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) mole ratio in the range of 4.5:1 to 6:1. The potassium silicate is formed by adding a water-soluble hydrosilica gel to a potassium silicate aqueous solution having a SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio less than 4.5:1. If the SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio of the silica potassium exceeds 6:1, gelation of the conductive material occurs, so that adhesiveness of a conductive layer formed of the conductive material becomes poor. Meanwhile, if the SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio is less than 4.5:1, a conductive layer formed of the conductive material adsorbs an excess of moisture and gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A potassium silicate aqueous solution having a SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio less than 4.5:1 is commercially available as KASIL (from the Philadelphia Quartz Company) or OHKA SEAL (from Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co., Ltd.). Hydrosilica gel is commercially available as PM (from the Philadelphia Quartz Company) or DARACLAR (from W. R. Grace Inc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The conductive material according to the present invention includes graphite particles, and an aqueous dispersion medium containing potassium silicate and a dispersing agent. A SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio in the aqueous dispersion medium is in the range of 4.5:1 to 6:1. The potassium silicate whose SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio is in the above range is formed by adding hydrosilica gel in a potassium silicate aqueous solution having a SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio less than 4.5. This preparation of the potassium silicate is preferred in terms of adhesiveness of a conductive layer to be formed with the conductive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Hydrosilica gel differs from colloidal silica in terms of their phase, water solubility, particles size, and the like, as shown in Table 1. Specifically, in preparation of a binder, the SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio at which gelation is initiated is different between hydrosilica gel and colloidal silica. In particular, gelation of the hydrosilica gel is initiated at a SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio greater than 6:1, whereas gelation of the colloidal silica is initiated at a SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio greater than 5:1. Thus, when a potassium silicate having a SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio greater than 5:1 is prepared with colloidal silica, and the potassium silicate is used as a binder of a conductive material, due to gelation of the conductive material, adhesiveness of a conductive layer formed of the conductive material becomes poor. Meanwhile, when a potassium silicate having a SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio in the range of 4.5:1 to 5:1 is prepared with colloidal silica, moisture or gas adsorption by the conductive layer is unsatisfactory.

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the amount of potassium silicate is in the range of 20-80 parts by weight, more preferably, in the range of 30-40 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight the total solids of the conductive material. If the amount of potassium silicate exceeds 80 parts by weight, the amount of graphite particles relatively decreases, so that conductivity of the conductive layer becomes poor. Meanwhile, if the amount of potassium silicate is less than 20 parts by weight, adhesiveness of the conductive layer is unsatisfactory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Any dispersing agent can be used in the aqueous dispersion medium. In the present invention, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) is used as a dispersing agent. The amount of dispersing agent is in the range of 1-3 parts by weight, more preferably, 2 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight the total solids of the conductive material. If the amount of dispersing agent is less than 1 part by weight, dispersion of each solid component in the aqueous dispersion medium becomes poor. Meanwhile, if the amount of dispersing agent exceeds 3 parts by weight, the amount of graphite particle and potassium silicate serving as a binder relatively decreases. This is undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The conductive material according to the present invention may further comprise a metal compound, as well as graphite particles and the aqueous dispersion medium containing potassium silicate and a dispersing agent. Addition of the metal compound slightly increases electric resistance. At least one metal compound selected from the group consisting of ferric oxide (Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), titanium dioxide (TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), and silicon carbide (SiC) may be used. The amount of metal compound is in the range of 5-50 parts by weight, more preferably, 10-40 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight the total solids of the conductive material. If the amount of metal compound is less than 5 parts by weight, there is no resistance control effect. Meanwhile, if the amount of metal compound exceeds 50 parts by weight, resistance becomes too high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the case where a metal compound is further added to the conductive material, the amount of graphite particles is in the range of 15-50 parts by weight, preferably, 30-40 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight the total solids of the conductive material. The amount of potassium silicate is in the range of 20-50 parts by weight, preferably, 30-40 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight the total solids of the conductive material. The amount of dispersing agent is in the range of 1-3 parts by weight, preferably, about 2 parts by weight, based on the total solids of the conductive material. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIG. 2, the conductive layers formed in Examples 1 through 5 have satisfactory specific resistances, and have enhanced adhesiveness compared with the conductive layers of Comparative Examples 1 and 2. The specific resistances of the conductive layers of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 are almost the same as those of the conductive layers of Examples 1 through 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, hot-evacuation temperature and time were measured for CRTs adopting the conductive layers of Examples 1 through 5, and Comparative Examples 1 and 2. As a result, for the CRTs adopting the conductive layers of Examples 1 through 5, the hot-evacuation time can be shortened, even at a low-evacuation temperature, compared with the CRTs having the conductive layers of Comparative Examples 1 and 2. In addition, the CRTs having the conductive layers of Examples 1 through 5 can be evacuated to a high vacuum level under the same processing conditions as applied in conventional CRT manufacturing method. Due to excellent adhesiveness of the conductive layer according to the present invention to the funnel of a CRT, lifetime of the CRT becomes longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As previously described, the conductive material according to the present invention, which is applied to form a conductive layer on the funnel of a CRT, uses potassium silicate dispersed in an aqueous dispersion medium with a SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O mole ratio in the range of 4.5:1 to 6:1, as a binder, so that adhesiveness of the conductive layer markedly increases. Use of the potassium silicate as a binder decreases the amount of gas released during a hot-evacuation process. As a result, evacuation time can be shortened. In addition, a CRT having almost same quality as a conventional CRT can be produced even at a low-evacuation temperature. The lamination of the conductive layer by external vibration or impact can be effectively suppressed. Thus, lifetime of the CRT becomes longer with increased productivity of the CRT. </paragraph>
