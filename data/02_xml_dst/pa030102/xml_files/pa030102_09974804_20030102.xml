<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a technology for providing information such as news via a network such as the Internet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, dissemination of information such as news or advertisement has been performed actively, using electronic mail (hereinafter, simply referred to as &ldquo;mail&rdquo;) or homepage through Internet. Also, transfer of mails via Internet and access to the homepage have recently performed not only by using personal computers, but also by using small portable terminal units such as mobile phones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, there exist services for providing information such as news to users as well as inserting advertising articles in the mail, by mailing list/mail distribution (so-called &ldquo;mail magazine&rdquo;) of the Internet. There also exist services for providing advertisement in line with user&apos;s intention, by distributing questionnaires beforehand to users to thereby grasp users&apos; taste and preference based on the contents of the questionnaire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, in the provided information, information necessary to a user and information not necessary to the user exist together, making arrangement of necessary information complicated. As a result, there is a problem in that not only the memory capacity of an information terminal unit is suppressed by unarranged information, but also it is difficult to find necessary information quickly. In particular, with an increase of information content, much time and labor are required only for deleting unnecessary information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the same information is transmitted to a personal computer and to a terminal unit having a small size such as mobile phone, there is a problem in that the information cannot be referred to efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, there is a problem in that advertisement distributed together with the provided information may become hindrance at the time of referring to the information and arranging the information. An advertisement having no relation to the provided information is particularly a problem. Preliminary questionnaires heretofore performed in order to handle this problem have a problem in that it is complicated for users and cannot correspond to changes in taste and preference of users. Offer of confused advertisement has a problem in that it has less advertising effect also for the provider of the advertisement. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of and an apparatus for distributing information and a computer program that make it possible for users to refer to, select and obtain information efficiently, and that can act for users in arrangement of the selected information. It is another object of the present invention to make it possible to provide effective advertisement to users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention according to one aspect is characterized by transmitting intensive information obtained by gathering all of or a part of the to-be-distributed information to a predetermined client unit, receiving selective information related to the to-be-distributed information selected from a plurality of to-be-distributed information gathered by the intensive information, extracting only predetermined to-be-distributed information from the to-be-distributed information database, based on the received selective information, creating contents by using the extracted to-be-distributed information and registering the created contents in a predetermined site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention according to another aspect is characterized by transmitting intensive information obtained by gathering all of or a part of the to-be-distributed information to a predetermined client unit, receiving selective information related to the to-be-distributed information selected from a plurality of to-be-distributed information gathered by the intensive information, extracting only predetermined to-be-distributed information from the to-be-distributed information database, based on the received selective information, and transmitting the extracted to-be-distributed information to the predetermined client unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a user only selects desired to-be-distributed information from the transmitted intensive information, to automatically create a homepage comprising only desired to-be-distributed information (and advertising information), or transmit a mail containing only desired to-be-distributed information (and advertising information). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Embodiment/s of the method of and the apparatus for distributing information and the computer program according to the present invention will now be described, with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The summary of this embodiment of the present invention will be first described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an outline of this embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> reference numeral <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> denotes an agent of distributed news (or a distributor of news). For example, it is an Internet provider or the like, and it is specifically constituted of hardware such as a server (details of the system structure will be described later (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral, <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> denote a user of the distributed news. Each user is constituted of hardware of an information processing unit having a communication function, such as a personal computer or a mobile phone, as a client unit, and connected to the server of the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via a network. <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> denote an advertiser who provides advertisement attached to the news distributed by the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises various files such as an advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, a user information file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a news source file <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a news category file <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and a news category file by user <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, and includes various processes such as a transmission process (A), a homepage (HP) creation process (C) and a mail preparation process (D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the transmission process (A), intensive information of the news information (news source) stored in the news source file <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as a summary mail. In the next reply step (B), a reply mail related to the selective information of the above news information (specifying necessary portion) is sent back to the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In the HP creation process (C), a homepage related to the news information is created based on the above selective information (and the advertising information) and registered in a predetermined site. Also, in the mail preparation process (D), a detailed mail of the news information is prepared based on the above selective information (and the advertising information), and transmitted to the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> By performing such processing, the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> selects desired news information, by looking at only the summary mail. Then, only the selected news information, the detailed information thereof is created as a homepage, and hence only the desired news information can be read efficiently in the later stage (user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the to-be-distributed information may be information having high urgency, which is desired to see immediately, without relying on the information processing terminal unit (media). Furthermore, there is a case where it is desired to judge whether it is necessary or not after having confirmed not only the selective information but also the detailed information, or there is a case where it is judged to be necessary after having confirmed the detailed information. In order to correspond to such needs, detailed information of the selected news information can be also received by mail (user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), so that only the desired news information can be read at once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> also has an information processing terminal unit connected to the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via a network. As the information processing terminal unit (medium), there are generally a personal computer (user X) and a portable type information processing terminal unit (user Y) such as a mobile phone or a PDA.

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The contents of processing in the transmission process (A) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents of processing in the transmission process (A). In the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the user information is first extracted from the user information file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (step S<highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>). Then, the detailed level is judged from the contents of the &ldquo;detailed level&rdquo; item in the user information file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>). When the content in the &ldquo;detailed level&rdquo; item is &ldquo;detailed&rdquo; (step S<highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>: detailed level&equals;detailed), control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, and when the contents in the &ldquo;detailed level&rdquo; item is &ldquo;simple&rdquo; (step S<highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>: detailed level&equals;simple), control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The medium is then judged in step S<highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> and step S<highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. Specifically, judgment is performed based on the contents in the &ldquo;media&rdquo; item in the user information file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Then, depending on the kind of each medium, editing of the respective summary mail, that is, editing of a detailed mail to a PC (step S<highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>), editing of a detailed mail to a mobile phone (step S<highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>), editing of a simple mail to a PC (step S<highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>), and editing of a simple mail to a mobile phone (step S<highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>) is performed using the news source file <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Specifically, for example, in the case of &ldquo;detailed level&equals;detailed&rdquo;, the &ldquo;title&rdquo;, &ldquo;item&rdquo; and &ldquo;text&rdquo; in the news source file <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are to be transmitted. On the other hand, in the case of &ldquo;detailed level&equals;simple&rdquo;, only the &ldquo;title&rdquo; and &ldquo;item&rdquo; in the news source file <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are to be transmitted. Thereafter, the edited summary mail is transmitted to the predetermined client unit (step S<highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a diagram showing one example of a detailed mail to a PC, edited in the transmission process (A). <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> shows one example of a display screen displayed on a display (large screen) of a personal computer (&ldquo;PC&rdquo;), being a client unit to which the summary mail has been transmitted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a diagram showing one example of a simple mail to a mobile phone, edited in the transmission process (A). <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> shows one example of a display screen displayed on a display (small screen) of a mobile phone, being a client unit to which the summary mail has been transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the transmission process (A) the medium that the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> uses and the necessary information contents are judged from the user information file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, to create the to-be-distributed information (news) corresponding thereto by using the news source file <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and distribute the created to-be-distributed information. Therefore, the contents of the summary mail to be displayed can be changed depending on the performance of the client unit and the size of the display. As a result, the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can confirm effectively the contents of the summary mail. The user can also select the desired format of the summary mail. The selected information is reflected in the user information file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this manner, the display format of the summary mail can be freely changed, depending on the taste and preference of the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the application of the summary mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The contents of processing in the reply process (B) in the user terminal unit (client unit) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will new described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents of processing in the reply process (B). In the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the client unit first judges whether the summary mail has been received or not (step S<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>). When waiting for receiving the summary mail, and the summary mail has been received (step S<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>: Yes), the received summary mail is displayed on the display of the client unit (step S<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> It is then judged whether there is an instruction to reply from the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or not, that is, whether the preparation operation of the reply mail described later has been performed or not (step S<highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>). Waiting for the preparation operation of the reply mail from the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and when the reply mail has been prepared (step S<highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>: Yes), the prepared reply mail is transmitted (replied) to the apparatus for distributing information (step S<highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>), to thereby complete a series of reply process. In this manner, the user can select the news that he/she wants the detailed information thereof to be distributed, or the news that he/she wants the detailed information thereof to be developed in the homepage, and can ask for its distribution to the apparatus for distributing information, serving as the distributor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the reply process with respect to the summary mail has been described, but even if it is a detailed mail which is prepared in the mail preparation process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and received, instead of the summary mail, the reply mail can be prepared by the reply process similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. By performing such processing, a homepage can be created again in the HP creation process, with regard to the contents confirmed by the detailed mail. This is for making the apparatus for distributing information efficiently act for the user in arrangement processing of the to-be-distributed information, by making the apparatus for distributing information perform arrangement of the detailed information, which has been heretofore performed by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a diagram showing one example of a method of preparing a reply mail in the reply process (B). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13, 1300</cross-reference> shows one example of a summary mail displayed on the display of the personal computer of the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. As method 1 of preparing the reply mail, the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> studies the contents of this summary mail and selects only the necessary portion. Alternatively, the user deletes only the unnecessary portion. Then, by performing reply mail operation, the user prepares the reply mail <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and transmits the reply mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As method 2 of preparing the reply mail, the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> studies the contents of this summary mail and prepares a reply mail by inputting only the &ldquo;title&rdquo; and the number of &ldquo;item&rdquo; of the necessary news information. In the prepared reply mail <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, the number of &ldquo;item&rdquo;, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is input, and thereby the news information of &ldquo;1.xxx area sale in lots, Starting new sales of 20 new detached houses and 5 buildings of apartment in xxx area, . . . &rdquo; can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a diagram showing one example of another method of preparing a reply mail in the reply process. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, 1400</cross-reference> shows one example of the summary mail displayed on the display of the mobile phone of the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In order to prepare a reply mail by the mobile phone, the &ldquo;title&rdquo; in the summary mail is input to the title in the reply mail (or input automatically by the reply mail preparing processing), and the number of &ldquo;item&rdquo; is then input. Subsequently to the input of the number, it is selected (input) whether he/she wants detailed information to be distributed by mail, or wants detailed information to be inserted in the homepage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> When the user wants detailed information to be distributed by mail, as shown in the reply mail <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight>, the user inputs the number &ldquo;1&rdquo;, then &ldquo;-&rdquo; and &ldquo;ML&rdquo;. On the other hand, when the user wants detailed information to be inserted in the homepage, as shown in the reply mail <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>, the user inputs the number &ldquo;1&rdquo;, then &ldquo;-&rdquo; and &ldquo;HP&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in addition to the selective information, a keyword for classifying the news information maybe input, using the reply mail of the mobile phone. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a diagram showing one example of another method of preparing a reply mail in the reply process. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, as the reply mail <highlight><bold>1501</bold></highlight> with respect to the summary mail <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>, the user inputs the number &ldquo;1&rdquo;, then &ldquo;&num;&rdquo; and &ldquo;newly built&rdquo; as the keyword. Thereby, the keyword &ldquo;newly built&rdquo; is added in the news information of the number &ldquo;1&rdquo; of the &ldquo;item&rdquo;. Detailed contents related to the keyword will be described later (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the reply process (B), by preparing a reply mail with respect to the summary mail and transmitting the reply mail, a desired form can be selected from the following four kinds of processing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> (1) To insert the selected news information only in HP; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> (2) To specify the selected news information as the to-be-distributed information and transmit (distribute) the detailed information thereof; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> (3) To specify the selected news information as the to-be-distributed information and transmit (distribute) the detailed information thereof, as well as being inserted in HP; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> (4) To specify the selected news information as the to-be-distributed information and transmit (distribute) the detailed information thereof, and the contents of the to-be-distributed information inserted in HP upon confirmation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The contents of processing in the HP creation process (C) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in particular, the contents of the HTML edit processing (C)-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents of processing in the HP creation process (C). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the contents of the HTML edit processing (C)-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the HP creation process. In the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, at first, it is judged whether a reply mail from a client unit has been received or not (step S<highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>). Here, as described above, the reply mail may be a reply mail with respect to the detailed mail transmitted by the mail preparation process (D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>, waiting for receiving the reply mail, and when the reply mail is received (step S<highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight>: Yes), the selective information (for example, a reply mail <highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>) is extracted from the received reply mail (step S<highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>). The news source selected by the user is specified from the selective information (step S<highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight>), and the specified news source is read from the news source file <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> (step S<highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>). Waiting for the completion of read in of the specified news source, and when the read in has been completed (step S<highlight><bold>1605</bold></highlight>: Yes), by performing the text&mdash;html conversion processing, the contents in the HTML format is created (step S<highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The information related to the site in which the created contents are registered (site information) is then extracted from the user information file <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>1607</bold></highlight>). However, when the created contents are to be registered in a new site, the site information newly set by a site setting section (not shown) is extracted. Then, the contents created in a predetermined site based on the extracted site information are registered (step S<highlight><bold>1608</bold></highlight>). The registered contents are displayed in the user area (details of news) in the homepage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as the contents in the browser screen <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to need, the site information is transmitted to the contents unit (step S<highlight><bold>1609</bold></highlight>). The contents unit, being a destination to which the site information is transmitted, may be the contents unit from which the reply mail has been transmitted, or a contents unit related to the created contents. The related contents unit stands for a case where, for example, the user has registered in advance a contents unit (a mobile phone or the like) of a separate medium from the contents unit (PC or the like). The contents of the transmitted site information includes a message, for example, &ldquo;A homepage has been created and registered, based on the reply mail transmitted at 14:20 on Jun. 12, 2001. The site where the homepage is registered is &ldquo;http://www.***.fujitsu.ne.jp&rdquo;. The registered period of the homepage is for two months.&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> are diagrams showing one example of a display layout of a homepage created by the HP creation process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows one example of a display by news, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows one example of a display by keyword. Detailed contents of the keyword addition and switching of the display will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Contents of processing in the HP creation process (C) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, particularly, contents of the advertisement selection processing (C)-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents of processing in the HP creation process (C), particularly, in the advertisement selection processing (C)-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the contents of the advertisement selection processing (C)-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, each step of from step S<highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>2003</bold></highlight> are similar to the contents in each step in step S<highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight> in the flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, and hence the description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The information related to the specified news source (news category) is then read from the news category file <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> (step S<highlight><bold>2004</bold></highlight>). It is then judged whether the read news category (&ldquo;housing&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>) coincides with (or resembles) the categories stored in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> or not, in other words, whether the category &ldquo;housing&rdquo; is in the &ldquo;category&rdquo; item in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (or may not necessarily coincide therewith, but a category similar to the category &ldquo;housing&rdquo; in the meaning is in the &ldquo;category&rdquo; item in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) or not (step S<highlight><bold>2005</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> It is judged whether the read news category coincides with (resembles) the categories stored in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, in one-to-one correspondence, or a plurality of news categories may be matched off against the categories stored in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to thereby judge whether the both categories coincide with each other (or may not necessarily coincide with each other, but there is a similar meaning in the both categories) or not. It is because there are normally many cases where the advertising information is inserted one in the vicinity of the display area of a plurality of news information, with respect to the plurality of news information. Specifically, when the first news category is &ldquo;X&rdquo; and the second news category is &ldquo;Y&rdquo;, only when the categories stored in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> include both categories of &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo;, it may be judged that the both categories coincide with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> If these categories do no coincide with each other, that is, the matching category does not exist in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>2005</bold></highlight>: No), the advertisement selection processing is finished without doing anything. On the other hand, if these categories coincide with each other (step S<highlight><bold>2005</bold></highlight>: Yes), the corresponding advertising information is selected from the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and the selected advertising information is subjected to the processing for making it to HTML format, and is added to the contents created in step S<highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> (step S<highlight><bold>2006</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, it can be judged that the category is &ldquo;Housing&rdquo; from the reply mail, from the news category file <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). It can be also judged that the advertising information having the category consistent with this category &ldquo;Housing&rdquo; is of company &ldquo;A&rdquo;, from the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). When this advertising information &ldquo;a_cm01.jpg&rdquo; of company &ldquo;A&rdquo; is processed into the HTML format, as shown in <highlight><bold>2101</bold></highlight>, the browser screen display as shown in <highlight><bold>2102</bold></highlight> is obtained. This display content is displayed in the advertising area <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the homepage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, in step S<highlight><bold>2007</bold></highlight>, the counter (calculation section <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) provided for respective advertising information is incremented by 1 (step S<highlight><bold>2007</bold></highlight>), in order to show that the insertion frequency in the homepage is increased by 1 with respect to the selected advertising information. Thereafter, control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1607</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a diagram showing an example of a display layout of a homepage created by the HP creation process. It is a homepage created by the processing (particularly, the advertisement selection processing (C)-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) in the HP creation process (C). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the details of the news are displayed in the user area <highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight>, together with the advertising information displayed in the advertising area <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Based on the contents of the news (housing-allied information), the advertising information related to the contents (information related to the house present) is displayed in the area <highlight><bold>2221</bold></highlight> close to the news display area <highlight><bold>2211</bold></highlight> in the advertising area <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight>. With respect to the information related to &ldquo;Gardening&rdquo;, the advertising information related to the &ldquo;wooden deck sale&rdquo; is displayed in the area <highlight><bold>2222</bold></highlight> close to the display area <highlight><bold>2212</bold></highlight> thereof in the advertising area <highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight>. In this manner, by displaying the contents of the news and the advertising contents in the same page, associated with each other, convenience with respect to the user can be improved, as well as improving the advertising effect of the advertiser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Contents of processing in the mail preparation process (D) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents of processing in the mail preparation process (D). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is also a diagram showing the contents in the mail preparation process (D) (text editing and advertisement selection). In the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, each step of from step S<highlight><bold>2301</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>2304</bold></highlight> has the same contents as each step of from step S<highlight><bold>1601</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, and hence its description is omitted. Read in of the news source in step S<highlight><bold>2304</bold></highlight> is performed from the news source file <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. When the read news source is not a text format, text editing is performed to make it text format (step S<highlight><bold>2305</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It is then judged whether an advertisement is attached to the detailed mail or not (step S<highlight><bold>2306</bold></highlight>). In the case of a mail without advertisement (step S<highlight><bold>2306</bold></highlight>: No), control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2311</bold></highlight> without doing anything. On the other hand, when an advertisement is attached, that is, in the case of a mail with advertisement (step S<highlight><bold>2306</bold></highlight>: Yes), the information related to the specified news source (news category) is read in from the news category file <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>2307</bold></highlight>), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. Then, it is judged whether the read news category (&ldquo;Housing&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>) coincides with the categories stored in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, in other words, the category &ldquo;Housing&rdquo; exists in the &ldquo;category&rdquo; item in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> or not (step S<highlight><bold>2308</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> If the both categories do not coincide with each other, that is, the matching category does not exist in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>2308</bold></highlight>: No), control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2311</bold></highlight> without doing anything. In this case, no advertisement is inserted. On the other hand, when the both categories coincide with each other (step S<highlight><bold>2308</bold></highlight>: Yes) the corresponding advertising information is selected from the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and the selected advertising information is processed into a text. Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, it can be judged that the category is &ldquo;housing&rdquo; from the reply mail, from the news category file <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Also, it can be judged that the advertising information having the category consistent with this category &ldquo;Housing&rdquo; is of company &ldquo;A&rdquo;, from the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). When this advertising information of company &ldquo;A&rdquo; is processed into a text, the browser screen display as shown in <highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight> is obtained. This display content is displayed in the mail <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Contents of re-display processing of the display screen will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents in the screen re-display processing according to this embodiment of the present invention. In the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, at first on the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> side (client unit), it is judged whether an instruction to display by keyword has been input by a user or not (step S<highlight><bold>2601</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> With regard to the display instruction, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, display instruction buttons <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> for display instruction are displayed at the lower side of the display screen. Moreover, the display instruction buttons <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight> indicate that which display form is being taken at present by means of a change of color of the button itself (reversing or the like). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, it is shown that the color of the &ldquo;Display by news&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight> is reversed, and the display screen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is sorted by news. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, in the state with the screen being sorted by news, by pushing the &ldquo;Display by keyword&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight>, display by keyword is instructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2601</bold></highlight>, waiting for having an instruction to display by keyword, and when the display by keyword is instructed (step S<highlight><bold>2601</bold></highlight>: Yes), the display instruction information is transmitted to the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> side (step S<highlight><bold>2602</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> On the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> side, waiting for receiving the display instruction information (step S<highlight><bold>2651</bold></highlight>), and when the display instruction information is received (step S<highlight><bold>2651</bold></highlight>: Yes), the registration information (homepage) created by the HP creation process (C) and registered by the registration section <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is extracted (step S<highlight><bold>2652</bold></highlight>) The keyword stored in the &ldquo;keyword&rdquo; item in the news category file by user <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is then extracted, based on the received display instruction information (step S<highlight><bold>2653</bold></highlight>), and based on the extracted keyword, the contents of the homepage extracted in step S<highlight><bold>2652</bold></highlight> is sorted (step S<highlight><bold>2654</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> It is then judged whether an advertisement is to be attached to the detailed mail or not (step S<highlight><bold>2655</bold></highlight>). In the case of not attaching advertisement (step S<highlight><bold>2655</bold></highlight>: No), control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2659</bold></highlight> without doing anything. On the other hand, when an advertisement is attached (step S<highlight><bold>2655</bold></highlight>: Yes) the information related to the specified news source (news category) is read in from the news category file <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or the news category file by user <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>2656</bold></highlight>) It is then judged whether the read news category coincides with (or resembles) the categories stored in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, in other words, the above-described read category exists in the &ldquo;category&rdquo; item in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> or not (step S<highlight><bold>2657</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> If the both categories do not coincide with each other, that is, coincided categories are not exist in the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>2657</bold></highlight>: No), control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2659</bold></highlight> without doing anything. On the other hand, when the both categories coincide with each other (step S<highlight><bold>2657</bold></highlight>: Yes), the corresponding advertising information is selected from the advertising information file <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and the selected advertising information is processed into an HTML format (step S<highlight><bold>2658</bold></highlight>), and control proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2659</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>2659</bold></highlight>, the registration processing similar to that in step S<highlight><bold>1608</bold></highlight> shown in the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is performed. As a result, a series of processing on the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> side is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Then, on the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> side, re-read in is performed (step S<highlight><bold>2603</bold></highlight>). As a result, the registration information registered in step S<highlight><bold>2659</bold></highlight> is received (step S<highlight><bold>2604</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, re-display processing is performed (step S<highlight><bold>2605</bold></highlight>) to thereby terminate a series of processing. The display shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is one example of the display screen which is subjected to the re-display processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As described above, by changing the order of display of the news information, the display position of the advertising information is also changed. Generally, in many cases, the advertising information is inserted in the area close to the news information in the display area with respect to a plurality of news information. Therefore, when the combination of the news information is changed by changing the order of display of the news information, the selected advertising information is also changed. That is to say, depending on the contents of the re-display, the advertising information selected before may not be selected anymore, and on the contrary, advertising information that has not been selected before may be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The contents of the update processing of the news source and the advertising information will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents in the update request processing according to this embodiment of the present invention. In the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, at first on the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> side (client unit), it is judged whether there is an update request from the user or not (step S<highlight><bold>2701</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> With respect to the update request, though not shown, for example, an instruction button instructing whether update is performed for respective news or not is displayed on the display screen of the client unit, and if this instruction button is pushed, it is judged that there has been an update request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2701</bold></highlight>, waiting for receiving the update request, and when the update request is received (step S<highlight><bold>2701</bold></highlight>: Yes) the information related to the update request (update request information) is transmitted to the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> side (step S<highlight><bold>2702</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> On the agent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> side, waiting for receiving the update request information (step S<highlight><bold>2751</bold></highlight>), and when the update request information is received (step S<highlight><bold>2751</bold></highlight>: Yes), setting whether update is necessary or unnecessary is performed (step S<highlight><bold>2752</bold></highlight>), to thereby update the &ldquo;update necessary or unnecessary&rdquo; item in the news category file by user shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (step S<highlight><bold>2753</bold></highlight>). When the one once set to &ldquo;update necessary&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;update unnecessary&rdquo;, this can be done by performing the same processing as the processing described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents in the update processing according to this embodiment of the present invention. In the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the information update section <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> first gathers news (step S<highlight><bold>2801</bold></highlight>). It is then judged whether the gathered news is the updated version of the news published before or not (step S<highlight><bold>2802</bold></highlight>). Here, when it is not the updated version (step S<highlight><bold>2802</bold></highlight>: No), the processing is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in step S<highlight><bold>2802</bold></highlight>, if it is the updated version of the news published before (step S<highlight><bold>2802</bold></highlight>: Yes), relevant No. is then set (step S<highlight><bold>2803</bold></highlight>), and the &ldquo;Relevant No.&rdquo; item in the news category file <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is updated (step S<highlight><bold>2804</bold></highlight>). The contents in the &ldquo;Relevant No.&rdquo; item in the news category file <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the contents in the &ldquo;No.&rdquo; item in the news category file by user <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> are compared, to thereby judge whether the both coincide with each other or not (step S<highlight><bold>2805</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2805</bold></highlight>, when the both do not coincide with each other (step S<highlight><bold>2805</bold></highlight>: No), the processing is terminated. On the other hand, the both coincide with each other (step S<highlight><bold>2805</bold></highlight>: Yes), it is then judged whether the &ldquo;update necessary or unnecessary&rdquo; item in the news category file by user <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> becomes &ldquo;update necessary&rdquo; or not (step S<highlight><bold>2806</bold></highlight>). Here, in the case of &ldquo;update unnecessary&rdquo; (step S<highlight><bold>2806</bold></highlight>: No), the processing is terminated. On the other hand, in the case of &ldquo;update necessary&rdquo; (step S<highlight><bold>2806</bold></highlight>: Yes), the HTML edit processing is performed (step S<highlight><bold>2807</bold></highlight>), and the content shaving subjected to the HTML edit processing is registered (step S<highlight><bold>2808</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Then, the update informing mail is transmitted to the contents unit by the recreated information transmission section <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> (step S<highlight><bold>2809</bold></highlight>), to thereby terminate a series of processing. The update informing mail contains information informing that it has been updated and that date and time, by the contents of, for example, &ldquo;This news has been updated on Jun. 12, 2001, at 10:00 am (last time), and on Jun. 9, 2001, at 10:00 pm (at the time before last).&rdquo;. If there are several updates, the information contains the date and time information for each update. Moreover, what is updated is not only news, but also may include advertising information. In the case of the advertising information, transmission of the update informing mail (step S<highlight><bold>2809</bold></highlight>) is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the contents of the news information, of which insertion into the HP has been requested, can be updated. Therefore, even in a case where predetermined time has passed since request of insertion into the HP has been made, the contents of the inserted news can be used sufficiently practically. Moreover, it may be set so as not to update, so that it can be prevented that the past information is rewritten by new information, thereby making impossible to refer to that information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Contents of accounting information preparation processing according to this embodiment of the present invention will now be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the contents in the accounting information preparation processing according to this embodiment of the present invention. In the flowchart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, the accounting information preparation section <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> comprises a timer (not shown), and it is judged whether it is predetermined date and time which is determined beforehand or not (step S<highlight><bold>2901</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The predetermined date and time may be predetermined date and time at the end of each month, or predetermined time interval (for example, for every 10 days). In step S<highlight><bold>2901</bold></highlight>, waiting for becoming the predetermined date and time, and when it becomes the predetermined date and time (step S<highlight><bold>2901</bold></highlight>: Yes), the counter information is extracted from the calculation section <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> (step S<highlight><bold>2902</bold></highlight>). Then, the accounting information preparation section <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> prepares accounting information (step S<highlight><bold>2903</bold></highlight>), and performs output processing of the prepared accounting information (step S<highlight><bold>2904</bold></highlight>), to thereby terminate the processing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, based on the extracted to-be-distributed information, only the predetermined advertising information is extracted, and the contents (homepage) are created by using the extracted to-be-distributed information and the extracted advertising information. As a result, advertising information is automatically selected based on the desired to-be-distributed information of the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and only the advertising information having contents matched to the taste and preference of the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is inserted, thereby enabling effective advertising for the advertiser <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Moreover, since the number of times the advertising information has been extracted, or the number of times the advertising information has been used for creation of the contents (homepage) is calculated for each advertising information, and accounting information is prepared based on the calculated number of times, proper charging based on the advertising effect can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the updated information is the extracted to-be-distributed information or the extracted advertising information, the contents are recreated using the updated information. As a result, the latest information can be always confirmed, and the user <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be informed of this matter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> News has been described above as one example of the to-be-distributed information (contents), but the to-be-distributed information is not limited to the news information. The to-be-distributed information may include not only the character information, but also all kinds of contents such as image information, video information, audio information, and the one obtained by uniting these contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the method of distributing information in this embodiment may be a computer readable program that is prepared beforehand, and can be realized by executing the program by a personal computer or a computer such as workstation. This program is recorded in a computer readable recording medium such as HD (hard disk), FD (floppy disk), CD-ROM, MO and DVD, and executed by being read from the recording medium by the computer. This program may be a transmission medium that can be distributed via a network such as Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As described above, with this invention, a user only selects desired to-be-distributed information from the transmitted intensive information, to automatically create a homepage comprising only desired to-be-distributed information (and advertising information), or transmit a mail containing only desired to-be-distributed information (and advertising information). Therefore, information can be arranged, by utilizing respective media characteristics, such as a mobile phone, or a personal computer, and without relying on the media. As a result, there is the effect that there can be obtained a method of distributing information, an apparatus for distributing information and an information distribution program that make it possible for users to refer to, select or obtain information efficiently, and that can act for users in arrangement of the selected information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with respect to a specific embodiment for a complete and clear disclosure, the appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to be construed as embodying all modifications and alternative constructions that may occur to one skilled in the art which fairly fall within the basic teaching herein set forth. </paragraph>
