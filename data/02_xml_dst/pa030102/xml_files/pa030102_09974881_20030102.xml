<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a liquid crystal display and a computer, particularly but not limited to, an active matrix liquid crystal display suitable for the display of a dynamic image and a computer suitably used with the liquid crystal display. The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 314274/2000, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, the display screen of a liquid crystal display (LCD) has been enlarged, and the definition has been enhanced. A displayed image ranges from a static image as in a liquid crystal display used for a personal computer, a word processor and the like, to a dynamic image as in a liquid crystal display used for TV and the like. Since the compression technology for dynamic images has progressed and a dynamic image can now be also easily handled in a computer, a frequency at which a dynamic image is displayed also increases in a liquid crystal display used for a personal computer and the like. It is conceivable that as LCD is thin, compared with TV provided with a cathode ray tube (CRT), and can be installed without occupying a large place, the ratio of popularization of LCD TVs in the general home will increas in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the schematic structure of a liquid crystal display as a related art. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> case that a computer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> such as a personal computer and a liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are separately provided is shown as an example. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, gradation data D<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and synchronism data D<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are output from the computer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, gradation data D<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> means an RGB signal and synchronism data D<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is data including a vertical synchronizing signal, a horizontal synchronizing signal, a data enable signal (DE) and a clock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes an LCD controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, a scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a reference gradation voltage generator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a backlight <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and an inverter for the backlight <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The LCD controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> generates gradation data D<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a signal side control signal D<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> respectively output to the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> based upon gradation data D<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and synchronism data D<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> respectively output from the computer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The LCD controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> also generates a scanning side control signal D<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> output to the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and controls the displayed contents of an image displayed on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the structure of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will be described below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an example of the structure of an active matrix LCD as a related art. Though the first and second glass substrates are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, LCD is provided with the first and second glass substrates. On the first glass substrate, n scanning lines <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> (n: natural number) and m signal lines <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (m: natural number) are arranged in a grid and a thin film transistor (TFT) <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> which is a nonlinear device (a switching device) is provided in the vicinity of each cross-point of the scanning line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the signal line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The gate electrode of TFT <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is connected to the scanning line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, the source electrode is connected to the signal line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the drain electrode is connected to a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The second glass substrate is arranged in a position opposite to the first glass substrate and a common electrode <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is formed on one surface of the glass substrate by a transparent electrode such as an indium-thin-oxide (ITO) film. Each common electrode <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is connected to a common electrode driving circuit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and the electric potential is set by the common electrode driving circuit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Liquid crystal is filled between the common electrode <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> formed on the first glass substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The scanning line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the signal line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> executes scanning by sequentially applying high potential to n scanning lines <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and turns on the TFT <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> connected to each scanning line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. Gradation voltage is written to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> via turned-on TFT <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> when the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> outputs gradation voltage. The signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> outputs gradation voltage according to image data to one of the m signal lines <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> while the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> turns on the scanning line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The amount of transmitted light is controlled based upon potential difference between the common electrode <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> set to a fixed potential and the gradation voltage written to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided with the backlight <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the inverter for the backlight <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for supplying power to the backlight <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. As the backlight <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> emits light at fixed luminance in a state in which the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is operated, the amount of transmitted light emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is controlled and display is made according to the above-mentioned operational principle. The reference gradation voltage generator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> supplies reference gradation voltage to the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the waveforms of signals output from the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which are respectively provided to the scanning line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and the signal line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in the conventional type liquid crystal display. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an x-axis shows time and VG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to VGn respectively show the waveform of a scanning signal applied to each scanning line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, high potential is applied to only one scanning line <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> at a time and the scanning signals VG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to VGn are signals sequentially output to n scanning lines <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. VD shows the waveform of a signal output to one signal line <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and Vcom shows the waveform of a signal applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. In an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the signal strength of the signal VD varies according to each image data, and the signal Vcom has a fixed value and is a signal which does not vary with time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display of the related art and its driving method are described above. However, in the liquid crystal display of the related art, voltage applied to each pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is held until the scanning line is selected next, thereby fixing transmitted light for one frame period. In the meantime, CRT sequentially scans using an electronic beam. In case a dynamic image is displayed on this LCD, a problem occurs in that the image quality deteriorates due to causes such as a residual image phenomenon. The cause of this deterioration is thought to be because the speed of a response of liquid crystal material is slow. As a result, when gradation varies, the variation of gradation cannot be completed in one field period and an accumulative response is performed in a few field periods. One approach to preventing this deterioration has involved the research of various liquid crystal materials that enable a high speed response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> However, it has been reported that the above-mentioned problems such as the residual image phenomenon are not caused by only the speed of the response of liquid crystal, but are also caused by the methods used to change the image displayed on LCD. Such reports have been made by NHK Broadcast Technical Research Institute and others (for example, refer to pp. 207 and 208 of SC-8-1 at 99&apos; General Meeting of The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers). To address the problems caused by the conventional methods used to change the image displayed on LCD, a method of driving CRT and a method of driving LCD will be described and compared below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show the result of comparison between CRT and LCD in the time response of display light at a certain pixel. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows the time response of CRT and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows the time response of LCD. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, CRT is a so-called &ldquo;impulse display&rdquo; that emits light only for a few milliseconds since an electronic beam reaches a fluophor on the surface of the tube, while LCD shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a so-called &ldquo;hold-type display&rdquo; that holds display light for one field period since the writing of data to a pixel is finished until the next writing is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When a dynamic image is displayed on CRT and LCD respectively having such characteristics, display as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> are made. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show examples of when a dynamic image is respectively displayed on CRT and LCD, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> showing the example of CRT, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> showing the example of LCD. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, a circular display object moves in a direction shown by x. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A, a</cross-reference> display object is instantaneously displayed in a position corresponding to time on CRT, while an image before one field remains until immediately before new writing on LCD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In case a person looks at a dynamic image displayed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, the dynamic image is viewed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> are explanatory drawings for explaining an image viewed by a person when a dynamic image is displayed on CRT and LCD, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> showing a case of CRT and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> showing a case of LCD. As shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, when a dynamic image is displayed on CRT, it is never viewed that an image displayed at a certain time is overlapped with an image from before that time. However, when a dynamic image is displayed on LCD, an image currently displayed is viewed in a state in which it, and an image displayed immediately before it, are overlapped due to the visual time integral effect and other effects, causing movement to become dim. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Some methods have been proposed for reducing the hold time of the displayed image by inputting voltage corresponding to a black image, prior to inputting voltage according to image data into each pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Such proposed methods prevent movement from being dim, thereby solving the above-mentioned problems caused when a dynamic image is displayed on LCD. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>D are explanatory drawings for explaining a method of preventing movement from being dim by inserting a black image between each image data. This method basically prevents movement from being dim by applying predetermined voltage for black display to liquid crystal for a horizontal blanking period as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. That is, after an image in one field is displayed, black is displayed on the whole screen and an image in the next field is displayed. However, according to this method, as display time is different for each respective scanning line of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. This difference in display time causes a problem in that luminance difference depends upon the location on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> as shown in an example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A method of preventing luminance difference from being caused is proposed in Japanese published unexamined patent applications No. Hei. 9-127917, No. Hei. 10-62811 and Japanese published unexamined patent applications No. Hei. 11-30789. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the structure of a liquid crystal display to solve the problem caused by the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. This structure is proposed in the above-mentioned patent application No. Hei. 9-127917. The same reference number is allocated to the same member as that in the liquid crystal display shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in addition to the circuit structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> circuit for writing black is newly provided, including: a black signal feeder <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a black signal supply line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, a scanning line for supplying a black signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, TFT for supplying a black signal <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and a scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> for driving the scanning line <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> for supplying a black signal. The gate electrode of the TFT for supplying a black signal <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is connected to the scanning line for supplying a black signal <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, the source electrode of the TFT for supplying a black signal <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is connected to the black signal supply line <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the drain electrode is respectively connected to the drain electrode of TFT <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the liquid crystal display having the above-mentioned configuration, voltage corresponding to black is applied to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in one field, and afterward, voltage according to image data is applied to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Image data is reset by independently driving each scanning line as described above, and illustrated in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. That is, difference in luminance is prevented by resetting each scanning line independently, inserting black after each image is displayed, instead of resetting all of the scanning lines simultaneously as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. By resetting the scanning lines as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the screen luminance differences can be prevented, as shown by the panel display in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, the deterioration of image quality such as a flicker occurs due to a black screen inserted also in the display of a static image, both in the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7C</cross-reference> and in the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, even though a hold-type display is suited for the display of the static image. Also, because the brightness of a display screen is reduced when a black screen is inserted, the luminance of the backlight is required to be set to a high value so as to acquire the brightness of the same extent as the brightness acquired in case no black screen is inserted. This increase in the luminescence of the back light increases power consumption, which is also a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A liquid crystal display in the present invention may display a dynamic image without dim movement or without the deterioration of luminance. A liquid crystal display in the present invention also may display a static image without needless power consumption or without the deterioration of image quality such as a flicker. Further, a computer suitably used with the liquid crystal display is provided by the illustrative embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The following description of the embodiments discloses specific configurations, features, and operations. However, the embodiments are merely examples of the present invention, and thus, the specific features described below are merely used to more easily describe such embodiments and to provide an overall understanding of the present invention. Accordingly, one skilled in the art will readily recognize that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described below. Furthermore, the descriptions of various configurations, features, and operations of the present invention that would have been known to one skilled in the art are omitted for the sake of clarity and brevity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram showing the schematic structure of a liquid crystal display according to a first illustrative, non-limiting embodiment of the present invention. In the first embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such as a personal computer and the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are separately provided. The computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> outputs gradation data D<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, synchronism data D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and an image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The gradation data D<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the synchronism data D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are respectively similar signals to gradation data D<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and synchronism data D<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, the gradation data D<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an RGB signal, and the synchronism data D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is data including a vertical synchronizing signal, a horizontal synchronizing signal, a data enable signal (DE) and a clock. The image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a signal of one bit showing whether image data (a signal composed of the gradation data D<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the synchronism data D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) outputted from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a dynamic image or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at a high level indicates that image data is a dynamic image and its at a low level indicates that image data is a static image. The image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be set so that the value is at a high level, for example, when an application for handling a dynamic image is run in the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Also, in another example, the value may be set to a high level when the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a TV tuner and the image data are based upon a signal output from the TV tuner. Further, in another example, the value may be also set manually by a user of the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes an LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a reference gradation voltage generator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a backlight <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, an inverter for the backlight <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a backlight control circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> generates gradation data D<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a signal side control signal D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> outputted to the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which are based respectively upon the gradation data D<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the synchronism data D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> outputted from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also generates a scanning side control signal D<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> outputted to the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and controls image display contents on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises the discriminating signal input terminal <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for outputting the image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, outputted from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the backlight control circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> controls the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, to define whether a black display is performed or not based upon the image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when a dynamic image is displayed to prevent movement from being dim. The black display causes a deterioration of the luminance in the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, without regards to a dynamic image or a static image. The black display is required when the dynamic image is displayed in order to prevent movement from being dim. However, black display is not required when the static image is displayed because no movement is made in a static image. Then, the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> defines whether the gradation data D<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the synchronism data D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are for the dynamic image or for the static image based upon the image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and it controls the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so that the black display is not performed and an line-sequential driving is performed when a static image is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The backlight control circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> outputs a control signal for controlling the luminance of light emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for illuminating the rear surface of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the inverter for the backlight <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> based upon the image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> input via the discriminating signal input terminal. Concretely, in case the image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates a dynamic image, the luminance of light emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is set to a high value to prevent the deterioration of display luminance caused due to black display for preventing movement from being dim. In the meantime, in case the image discriminating signal shows a static image, the luminance of light emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is set to a low value from the viewpoint of the reduction of power consumption because the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> controls so that black display is not made. The reference gradation voltage generator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is similar to the reference gradation voltage generator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the structure of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the structure of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the waveforms of a part of signals output from the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The waveforms of the signals shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> are those of signals respectively output from the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> when a dynamic image is displayed and in the case of a static image, the waveforms of the similar signals to the waveforms shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are output and line-sequential driving is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is provided with first and second glass substrates as in the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. On the first glass substrate, n scanning lines <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (n: natural number) and m signal lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (m: natural number) are arranged in a grid, and TFT <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is a nonlinear device (a switching device) is provided in the vicinity of each cross-point of a scanning line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a signal line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The gate electrode of TFT <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is connected to the scanning line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the source electrode is connected to the signal line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the drain electrode is connected to a pixel electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The second glass substrate is arranged in a position opposite to the first glass substrate and a common electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed on one surface of the glass substrate by a transparent electrode such as ITO. Liquid crystal is filled between the common electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> formed on the first glass substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Scanning signals VG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to VGn in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> are applied to each of the scanning lines <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. A signal VD in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> corresponding to image data is applied to the signal line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, each of the scanning signals VG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to VGn includes two scanning line selection periods which are a selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in one field. For a selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, writing gradation voltage according to image data is loaded to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. For a selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, writing voltage according to black display is loaded to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Gradation voltage according to image data and voltage according to black display are alternately outputted to each signal line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is one characteristic of the first embodiment is corresponding to approximately a half of a conventional scanning line selection period t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. For example, scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is selected at the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then the scanning line Gj, which is separated from the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by at least one other scanning line G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is selected for black display at the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Voltage according to black display is applied to the signal line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a black screen which is called a &ldquo;reset image&rdquo; is displayed because liquid crystal capacitance <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> shields light from the backlight <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As describe above, scanning line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is selected individually for black display, which is so-called &ldquo;reset driving&rdquo;, instead of selecting all scanning line for black display at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the liquid crystal display in the first illustrative embodiment will be described in detail. In the following description, each of plural scanning lines <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is discriminated using G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Gn and each of signals <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is discriminated using D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Dm. Suppose that the display of image data is made in the order of the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, - - - and black display is made from the &lsquo;j&rsquo;th (j: natural number: 1&lt;j&lE;n) scanning line Gj. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> First, the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is selected for the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in this state, gradation voltage according to image data is applied to the signal line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. TFT <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected to the scanning line G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on and the display of the liquid crystal capacitance <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> begins to display according to image data. Next, the scanning line Gj is selected for the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and in this state, voltage according to black display is applied to the signal line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When this voltage is applied, TFT <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected to the scanning line Gj is turned on and the liquid crystal capacity <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> becomes black. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the scanning line Gj elapses, and then the scanning line G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is scanned and the similar operation to a case in which the scanning line D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is scanned is executed. The scanning line Gj&plus;1 is scanned next to the scanning line G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the similar operation to a case in which the scanning line Gj is scanned is executed. Afterward, similarly, the scanning line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is selected in the order of the scanning line G<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, Gj&plus;2, - - - . A band black screen display area shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is displayed on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by such a driving method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the contents displayed instantaneously on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> when a dynamic image is displayed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in case the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set to substantially the center of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, one screen is composed of three display areas of a normal image display area A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a normal image display area A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As time elapses, the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is moved in a direction shown by an arrow D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. When the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> reaches the lower end of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a part of the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is moved to the upper end of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the area occupied by the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the lower end decreases and the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is moved in the direction shown by the arrow D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, increasing area occupied by the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the upper end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the first illustrative embodiment, black display prevents movement from being dim when a dynamic image is displayed. An interval between the scanning line selected in the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the scanning line selected in the selection period for image data is equivalent to the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A rate occupied by the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on one screen is set to a degree at which dim movement is not identified when a dynamic image is displayed. The black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is scrolled by one scanning line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by making the above-mentioned black display as the normal image display areas A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, luminance is almost similar at any location on the display screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It is described that the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set after the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.

Generally, in case a liquid crystal display has a large area according to XGA, the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are composed of plural members. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a case that the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is composed of three scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is also composed of plural members, however, they are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A scanning side start pulse (STV), a scanning side clock (VCLK) and an output control signal (OE) are output from the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to each scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Gradation data (Data), a signal side start pulse (STH), a signal side clock (HCLK), a signal output pulse (STB) and a polarity inversion pulse (POL) are output from the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. As the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> controls by respectively outputting scanning side start pulses STV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to STV<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and further, outputting output control signals OE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to OE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are separately controlled by the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The scanning side start pulses STV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to STV<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are respectively a pulse for instructing each scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to start scanning. That is, the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>starts scanning when the scanning side start pulse STV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is input, the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>starts scanning when the scanning side start pulse STV<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is input, and the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>starts scanning when the scanning side start pulse STV<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is input. If three scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are provided, one frame period is divided into three and the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is scanned from the upside to the downside because the scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>scan each divided frame period in the order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned output control signals OE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to OE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are for controlling whether one scanning line is activated or deactivated in a period for scanning one scanning line, when the scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>scan, for example, two scanning lines. That is, in the first embodiment, as described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> period in which one scanning line is scanned is divided into the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A scanning line different from a scanning line activated to apply gradation voltage according to image data in the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is activated to apply voltage according to black display in the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a scanning line to apply voltage according to black display in the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is required to be deactivated and in the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a scanning line to apply gradation voltage according to image data in the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is required to be deactivated. The output control signals OE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to OE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are used to control the above-mentioned activation and inactivation of scanning lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation when a static image is displayed will be described. As described above, when a displayed image is a static image, a value of an image discriminating signal output from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is at a low level. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a timing chart showing various signals output from the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when a static image is displayed. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, signals for one frame if the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has 768 scanning lines are shown. VG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VG<highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> and VG<highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> respectively show the waveforms of scanning signals applied to first, 257th and 513th scanning lines. In case 768 scanning lines are provided, the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>scans the first to the 256th scanning lines, the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>scans the 257th to the 512th scanning lines and the scanning line driving circuit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>scans the 513th to the 768th scanning lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when a static image is displayed, scanning side start pulses STV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to STV<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are respectively output to the scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in one frame period only once. Therefore, line-sequential driving is performed by the scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>As the control of the activation and inactivation of scanning lines in a period in which one scanning line is scanned is not required in case a static image is displayed, output control signals OE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to OE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are controlled so that they are always at a low level. As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, when a static image is displayed, line-sequential driving is performed. That is, a scanning line is provided with fixed voltage in a period for scanning one scanning line and retained active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> When a static image is displayed, an image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the value of which is at a low level, is also input to the backlight control circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In this case, the backlight control circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> sets the luminance of light emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the same extent as the luminance of light emitted from a backlight with which a conventional type liquid crystal display is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation when a dynamic image is displayed will be described. As described above, in case a displayed image is a dynamic image, a value of an image discriminating signal output from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is at a high level. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a timing chart showing various signals output from the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when a dynamic image is displayed. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, signals for one frame in case the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has 768 scanning lines are also shown and VG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, VG<highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> and VG<highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> respectively show the waveforms of scanning signals applied to first, 257th and 513th scanning lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, when a dynamic image is displayed, scanning side start pulses STV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to STV<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are respectively output to scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>twice in one frame period and two scanning lines are scanned at a time. When a dynamic image is displayed, control is required to be performed so that only one of the two scanning lines scanned at a time is activated in a period in which one scanning line is scanned. Therefore, output control signals OE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to OE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are signals, the cycle of which is set to a half of a period in which one scanning line is scanned, and the phase of which is inverse only once in one frame. It is for the following reasons that the phase of the output control signals OE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to OE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inverse only once in one frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, gradation voltage according to image data and voltage according to black display are alternately supplied to the signal line driving circuit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from the LCD controller <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (refer to STH (Data) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). In STH (Data) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> location B is a location where voltage according to black display is supplied. In a state in which such a signal is supplied, as voltage applied to the pixel electrode <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> connected to a certain scanning line is required to be switched from gradation voltage according to image data to voltage according to black display and is required to be switched from voltage according to black display to gradation voltage according to image data, the inversion of the phase is made. In other words, to switch the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, phase inversion is made. In an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, each polarity of output control signals OE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to OE<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inverted in locations P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, black display is made on 256 scanning lines equivalent to one third of 768 scanning lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> When a dynamic image is displayed, an image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the value of which is at a high level, is also input to the backlight control circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. In this case, the backlight control circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> controls so that the luminance of light emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is set to a higher value than the luminance of light emitted from a backlight with which a conventional type liquid crystal display is provided. As described above, black display is made to prevent dim movement when a dynamic image is displayed. However, as the display luminance of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is deteriorated for black display, the deterioration of the display luminance is prevented by setting the luminance of light emitted from the backlight <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to a high value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned embodiment, for the simplification of description, the case that the plural scanning line driving circuits <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are provided and the scanning line connected to one of these circuits is set to the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) is described. However, the area of the black screen display area A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the display screen of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be set to an arbitrary value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, a second illustrative, non-limiting embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the first illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the display method and the backlight of the liquid crystal display are controlled based upon whether image data is a dynamic image or a static image. In case a dynamic image is displayed, it may be also displayed on a part of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Dim movement caused in a hold-type display is caused by a difference between the amount of movement of a displayed dynamic image and the following kinetic competence of a person&apos;s eye. Therefore, it has been reported that the degree of dim movement is large when the mount of movement of a dynamic image is large on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and that the degree of dim movement is small when the amount of the movement of a dynamic image is small on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (refer to pp. 207 and 208 of SC-8-1 at 99&apos; General Meeting of The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> That is, when the dynamic image is displayed in a window, which is not a whole of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, but is a part of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, dim movement is not perceived so much, as long as the part of the liquid display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is proper size. That is because difference between the amount of the movement of a dynamic image and the following kinetic competence of a person&apos;s eye is small. Then, in the second embodiment of the present invention, the criterion of a display method of a liquid crystal display and the judgment of whether a backlight is controlled or not is based upon the area ratio of a liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a window in which a dynamic image is displayed. That is, in case the area ratio of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a window in which a dynamic image is displayed is a certain threshold or more, an image displayed on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is judged to be a dynamic image and an image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned to a high level. In the meantime, in cases when the area ratio of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a window in which a dynamic image is displayed is smaller than a certain threshold, an image displayed on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is judged to be a static image and the image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned to a low level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> explains a principle for judging whether an image displayed on the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a dynamic image or not based upon the area ratio of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the window. In case a dynamic image is handled by a computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the processing speed is generally enhanced using an overlay function of hardware. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> reference number <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> denotes VRAM for temporarily storing image data. In VRAM <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, an on-screen area SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for temporarily storing image data for display and an off-screen area SC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for temporarily storing dynamic image information are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In case an application that handles a dynamic image is activated, an area R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for defining in which position of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> a dynamic image stored in the off-screen area SC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is displayed is secured in the on-screen area SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An area R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the on-screen area SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shows a display area of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Data showing key color (for example, black and dark blue) is stored in the area R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In case a dynamic image is displayed, an overlay selection circuit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> generates the image data Im read in the area R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in which data showing key color defined in the on-screen area SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored of a dynamic image temporarily stored in the off-screen area SC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and displays the image data Im on the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The above-mentioned structure is used heretofore to realize the overlay function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the second illustrative embodiment of the present invention, an area threshold memory for discriminating a dynamic image/a static image <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a key color area detecting/comparing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are provided in addition to the above-mentioned configuration. The area threshold memory <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> stores a first predetermined threshold value to judge whether an image is a dynamic image or not. The first predetermined threshold value is an area ratio of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the area R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which defines the display area of a dynamic image. The key color area detecting/comparing circuit <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> judges whether an image is a dynamic image or not by detecting the area R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> data showing key color set in the on-screen area SC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored, calculating the area ratio of the area R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an area R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> showing the display area of the liquid crystal display panel <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and comparing this area ratio with the first predetermined threshold value stored in the area threshold memory <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and outputs the result of the judgment as an image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An image judged to be a dynamic image includes an image in a part of which a dynamic image is included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Next, a liquid crystal display according to a third illustrative, non-limiting embodiment of the present invention will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram showing the structure of the liquid crystal display according to the third illustrative embodiment of the present invention. The liquid crystal display shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is provided with an image discriminating circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for judging whether image data outputted from a computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shows a dynamic image or not. The liquid crystal display shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is different from the liquid crystal display according to the first illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in that the image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> outputted from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the first illustrative embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, as the image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is outputted from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a circuit for judging whether an image is a dynamic image or not is required to be provided in the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. However, in the third illustrative embodiment, as the liquid crystal display <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> itself is provided with the image discriminating circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that judges whether an image is a dynamic image or not and the structure of the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not required to be changed, the third illustrative embodiment is suitable for device configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram showing the internal structure of the image discriminating circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The image discriminating circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided with a frame memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a comparison/determination circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The frame memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> stores image data outputted from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for one frame. The comparison/determination circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> compares image data outputted from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and image data previous by one frame stored in the frame memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and judges whether an image is a dynamic image or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the image discriminating circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference> are explanatory drawings for explaining the operation of the image discriminating circuit. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference> shows an example of image data previous by one frame stored in the frame memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</cross-reference> shows an example of the image data of a frame currently outputted from the personal computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference>, a dynamic image of an automobile crossing in front and only movement of the automobile is shown. For such a dynamic image, the comparison/determination circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> judges that image data outputted from the computer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is image data showing a dynamic image because image data is different between frames. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned third embodiment, it is judged whether image data is a dynamic image or not based upon whether there is movement in two frames or not. However, the storage capacity of the frame memory <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be increased to store the image data of plural frames, and the plural frames may be compared in order to judge whether image data is a dynamic image or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned third embodiment, image data is considered to be a dynamic image when there is any movement between frames. Therefore, an image discriminating signal J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be turned to a high level even if a display area where a dynamic image is displayed is so small that it might not necessary to control the LCD controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as described in the first embodiment. Then, a frame may be divided in to a plurality of blocks, which is a detection area, and it may be detected how many detection areas have movement, instead of comparing whole frames. When a number of detection areas which have movement is larger than or equal to a second predetermined threshold value, an image data should be judged to be a dynamic image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> A few detection points may be set in the frame for detecting movement, instead of defining detection areas in the frame. When a number of detection points which have movement is larger than or equal to a third predetermined threshold value, an image data should be judged to be a dynamic image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The liquid crystal displays according to the embodiments of the present invention are described above. However, the present invention is not limited to the illustrative embodiments and the present invention may be freely changed in a scope of the present invention. For example, in the above-mentioned embodiments, black display is made by separating a period in which one scanning line is scanned into the selection period for image data t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the selection period for black display t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to prevent dim movement. However, a method of black display is not limited to this and the embodiment can be also applied to the method described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>D and the liquid crystal display provided with the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The invention is not limited to the case that black is displayed as the reset image and if dim movement can be prevented by displaying a single color as the reset image in a part of image data, the present invention can be applied, and one skilled in the art will readily know that the present invention can be applied to devices containing different layers and materials. Accordingly, other structural configurations may be used, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the luminance control circuit is provided to control the luminance of the backlight based upon whether a display image is a dynamic image or a static image. Therefore, the luminance may not be deteriorated even when a dynamic image is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Further, the display control circuit is provided to control so that a part or the whole of a dynamic image is turned to be a single color for a predetermined time based upon whether a displayed image is a dynamic image or a static image. Therefore, dim movement may be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> When a static image is displayed, the display control circuit performs line-sequential driving, instead of turning a part of a static image or a whole of a static image into a single color. Therefore, the deterioration of image quality such as a flicker may be prevented. In addition, the deterioration of display luminance may also be prevented. As a result, as the luminance of the backlight is not required to be set to a high value, wasteful power consumption can be prevented. </paragraph>
