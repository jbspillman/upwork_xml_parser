<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a display apparatus, and more particularly, to a display apparatus capable of indicating a picture-in-picture (PIP) function on a color display tube (CDT) monitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With a jump to a higher level of information society, multimedia systems have rapidly come into wide use. Accordingly, the importance of display devices functioning as a bridge between human beings and electronic devices has increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Analog signals have been generally used when displaying a signal from a personal computer (PC) or television/video through a CDT monitor system. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> signal from a PC <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is amplified by an amplification unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is displayed on a CDT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> monitor such as a cathode-ray tube. On the other hand, digital data must be used when a signal from the PC or television/video is displayed through a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to realize the PIP (picture-in-picture) function of indicating at least one sub-screen together with one main screen at the same time, as an optional function of a monitor, a signal from a PC or television/video must undergo a digital signal process. Therefore, the PIP function can be more easily realized in the LCD monitor than in the CDT monitor. To realize the PIP function in the CDT monitor, a scaler integrated circuit (IC) that is used in the LCD monitor is needed. However, when the scaler IC is used, a signal is displayed on the CDT screen after being converted into a digital signal, processed with a PIP process in the scaler IC, and then converted back into an analog signal. During these processes, screen image quality may be degraded. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for processing signals in a monitor so that an image of high definition is displayed without any degradation of image quality when the PIP function is realized in the CDT monitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is another object to have an apparatus for processing signals in a monitor for the picture-in-picture function that is easy to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object to have an apparatus for processing signals in a monitor for the picture-in-picture function that is inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the above and other objects are achieved by an apparatus for processing a signal. It is preferable that the apparatus includes a signal dispensing unit for dispensing an output signal output from a personal computer in the form of an analog or digital signal and outputting the same, a signal processing unit for performing picture-in-picture signal processing enabling one of a digital personal computer signal generated by the signal dispensing unit and a decoded television or video signal input from an outside source to be displayed on a main screen and the other to be displayed on one or more sub-screens, and for processing the television or video signal to be displayed alone on the main screen, an outputting unit for outputting an analog personal computer signal generated from the signal dispensing unit in response to a control signal for displaying only the person computer signal, and outputting an output signal of the signal processing unit in response to a control signal for displaying the picture-in-picture and television or video signals, and a monitor for amplifying the signal output from the outputting unit to be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the apparatus further includes a signal conversion unit for converting the picture-in-picture signal output from the signal processing unit into an analog signal before a signal is output from the outputting unit. The signal processing unit includes a decoding unit for converting the television or video signal into a digital signal and decoding the same, a scan rate conversion unit for converting a scan rate of the decoded television or video signal, and a signal processing unit for performing a picture-in-picture signal process on the television or video signal whose scan rate is converted and the digital personal computer signal, so that one of the television or video and the digital personal computer signal is displayed on the main screen and the other of the television or video and the digital personal computer signal is displayed on the plurality of sub-screens, or for processing the television or video signal to be displayed alone on the main screen.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the apparatus includes an ADC (analog to digital converter) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for converting an analog signal output from a personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into a digital signal, a decoding unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for converting a signal from a television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into a digital signal and decoding the same, a scan rate conversion unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for changing a scan rate of the decoded signal from the television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a signal processing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for performing the picture-in-picture (PIP) function of displaying one of the personal computer (PC) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> signal output from the ADC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> signal output from the scan rate conversion unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the main screen and displaying the other on a plurality of sub-screens, or processing the television or video signal to be displayed, a DAC (digital to analog converter) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for converting an output signal generated from the signal processing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into an analog signal, an outputting (switching) unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for outputting the analog signal output from the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when only the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> signal is displayed and outputting a signal output from the DAC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> when both the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> signal and the television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> signal are displayed using the picture-in-picture function, an amplifying unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for amplifying a signal output from the outputting unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and a color display tube <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for displaying the amplified signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the apparatus for processing a signal in the monitor is operated largely in three modes including displaying a signal from the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (1st mode), displaying a signal from the television or video (TV/video) (2nd mode); and displaying two or more signals at the same time, i.e., picture-in-picture function (3rd mode). The television signal can be defined as broadcast video signals used to display an image that are for example transmitted through the air or through mediums such as conducting wire, fiber optics, or other mediums. The video signal can be defined as any possible signal that can be used to display an image and may include for example non-broadcast video signals such as from a video cassette recorder, digital versatile disc, video compact disc, and other media that can be used to generate a video image. The television or video signal can for example be originally in formats such as NTSC (National Television Standards Committee), SECAM (Sequential Color and Memory System), PAL (Phase Alternating Line), or other formats. The signal from the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be for example in a VGA (Video Graphics Array) mode format or other modes with higher resolution (i. e., SVGA for super video graphics array, XGA for extended graphics array, etc.). The signals above have varying constraints such as frequencies and resolutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the first mode, the color display tube <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> displays a signal from the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without modification. A signal from the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is selected by inputting an outputting (switching) control signal to the outputting unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The selected signal from the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is amplified by the amplifying unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and output to the color display tube <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. A signal dispensing unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for dispensing a pure analog signal output from the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a digital signal passing through the ADC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is included in the apparatus. In the first mode, the analog signal from the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is output from the signal dispensing unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the second mode, a signal from the television or video unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is converted into a digital signal and decoded in the decoding unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. For smoothly processing a signal, a scan rate of the decoded signal from the television or video is changed by the scan rate conversion unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A horizontal frequency of the personal computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is 30&tilde;85 kHz (17&Prime;, 19&Prime; diagonal measurement of display screen) and that of the television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is 15.7 kHz (kilohertz) and thus, an error due to a large difference between the horizontal frequencies maybe made during signal processing. This problem can be solved by changing the scan rate of a signal generated from the television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> signal having a horizontal frequency of 15.7 kHz is changed to have a horizontal frequency of 31.4 kHz when passing through the scan rate conversion unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> signal whose scan rate is changed is scaled in the signal processing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to be displayed on the CDT <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The scaled television or video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> signal passes through the DAC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and is then converted into an analog signal. A signal output from the DAC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is selected by inputting an outputting control signal to the outputting unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The selected signal from the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is amplified in the amplifying unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and output to the CDT <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the third mode, at least two signals are displayed (PIP function) at the same time, i.e., the signals of the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the TV/video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are displayed at the same time. According to one embodiment of the third mode, a digital signal output by the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is output from the signal dispensing unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the signal processing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The signal from the TV/video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> passes through the decoding unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the scan rate conversion unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is output to the signal processing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In this mode, the signal processing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> selects a main screen and sub-screens, processes a signal to correspond to a selected screen and processes a scaling for displaying the signal. As another embodiment, to realize the PIP function, a signal from the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a signal from the TV/video are displayed, one on the main screen and the other on a sub-screen. A PIP signal generated from the signal processing unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is converted into an analog signal in the DAC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this mode, a signal output from the DAC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is selected by inputting an outputting control signal to the outputting unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The selected signal from the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is amplified in the amplifying unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and output to the CDT <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The function of the outputting unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is the same in the second and third modes, i.e., it is controlled to switch an output signal of the DAC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. However, the function of the DAC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is not the same. That is, the DAC <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> outputs the scaled signal of the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be displayed in the second mode, whereas it outputs signals from the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the TV/video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which are PIP processed, to be displayed in the third mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described apparatus, a pure signal from the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a signal from the TV/video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> or a PIP signal that is the combined signals from the PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the TV/video <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is displayed on the CDT <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, the PIP function can be realized, and also, a signal of high definition can be displayed on the CDT monitor. </paragraph>
