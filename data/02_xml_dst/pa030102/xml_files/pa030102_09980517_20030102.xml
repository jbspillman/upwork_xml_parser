<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a receiving apparatus and method, and is particularly applicable to a receiving apparatus and method for receiving and demodulating broadcasting waves distributed via a broadcasting satellite in a digital satellite broadcasting system (a transmission medium). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years a digital satellite broadcasting system has been proposed to distribute hundreds of programs to audiences via a broadcasting satellite using carrier frequencies allocated to corresponding channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In an IRD (Integrated Receiver Decoder) being a device to receive each carrier frequency in this digital satellite broadcasting system, a receiving and demodulating device provided therein is designed to obtain a transport stream by receiving carrier frequencies (satellite broadcasting waves) distributed via a broadcasting satellite and selecting and demodulating an arbitrary frequency out of the received carrier frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an information transmission-reception relationship between a CPU <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> inside the IRD and a front end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The front end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being a receiving/demodulating device as a receiving/demodulating means consists of a tuner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to select a desired frequency, a demodulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to demodulate a modulated signal, and an error corrector <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to detect errors occurring during transmission, and to correct them by means of a given method, and is controlled by the CPU <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Designed to perform various processes in accordance with a program read out from a prescribed memory (not shown in figure), the CPU <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises an operating system <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (called &ldquo;OS&rdquo; hereinafter) as a CPU functional unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>X for performing various processes, an application program <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The OS <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is to conduct a variety of processes based on the application program <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the program of the driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this connection, the OS <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the application program <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are not physical blocks but functional ones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When a user performs the operation of selecting a channel of a desired program with a given input means provided in the IRD, the application program <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the CPU functional unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>X judges which carrier frequency a user-desired program is allocated to, and transmits the result (information on what hertz of a carrier frequency for the user-desired channel) to the driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> performs a process on data so that the front end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (tuner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, demodulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and error corrector <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) can operate properly based on the judgement result transferred from the application program <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, resulting in the selection of an arbitrary frequency out of the carrier frequencies (satellite broadcasting waves) allotted to a zone, in Japan for example, where an IRD is used, and the selected carrier frequency is changed (set) so as to be outputted as a transport stream to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In this case, the tuner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> selects a channel (carrier frequency) specified by the user out of the carrier frequencies received via a broadcasting satellite, and creates an intermediate frequency by conducting the given frequency converting process on the selected carrier frequency, and transmits it to the demodulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The demodulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> performs the given demodulating process on the intermediate frequency supplied from the tuner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and transmits it to the error corrector <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The error corrector <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> performs the given error correcting process on the transport stream with the use of a data line allocated in advance for conducting processes such as error detection, subsequently the resultant transport stream is outputted to outside the front end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In such an IRD as described above, since the driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> inside the CPU functional unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>X is to set a carrier frequency and a demodulating method predetermined for a designated zone, using the IRD outside of the designated zone presents a problem in that it is necessary to alter the hardware structure (namely, the tuner <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the demodulator <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the error corrector <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) of the front end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in accordance with the carrier frequency and the demodulating method used in the zone, and the program of the driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> inside the CPU functional unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>X for controlling the whole IRD has to be altered accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In such an IRD which receives a satellite broadcast, since the driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> inside the CPU functional unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>X and the hardware of the front end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are designed to set a carrier frequency and a demodulating method in satellite broadcasting, the case of receiving a broadcast by a different transmission medium such as CATV (Cable Television) presents problems in that it is also necessary to alter the hardware structure of the front end <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in accordance with a transmission medium, and the program of the driver <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> inside the CPU functional unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>X has to be altered accordingly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Detailed description is given on one mode of carrying out the present invention hereinafter with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shows a digital broadcast receiving system as a whole, wherein an IRD (Integrated Receiver/Demodulator) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is designed to receive via a parabola antenna <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> satellite broadcasting waves distributed via a broadcasting satellite (not shown in figure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The IRD selects, as required, a user-desired channel (carrier frequency) out of satellite broadcasting waves received, based on an infrared signal S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> outputted via a remote controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and outputs to a TV set <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> given data such as video data, audio data and program guide information (this program guide information is referred to as &ldquo;Electronic Program Guide&rdquo; hereinafter) obtained based on the selected carrier frequency. The TV set <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> visibly displays images, and a program guide if necessary, obtained based on the given data supplied from the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on a monitor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> such as a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) or a liquid crystal display, with audio sounds outputted from a speaker (not shown in figure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As the internal structure of the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when a user conducts a given operation to turn on the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> loads a startup program stored in a ROM <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> on a RAM <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to perform various processes according to the program. The CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives a given command obtained by operating an operation button switch (not shown in figure) on a front panel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and loads a program corresponding to the command on the RAM <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to control each circuit in accordance with the program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By operating the operation keys of the remote controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the command is outputted, superimposed onto the infrared signal S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by the IR (Infrared) transmitter (not shown in figure) of the remote controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and then the infrared signal S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is received by a IR receiving unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which supplies the result of the reception to the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It means that the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also receives the given command obtained by operating the remote controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and then loads on the RAM <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> the given program corresponding to the command given, to control each circuit unit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> According to the above structure, since the data processing unit (CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) can control the hardware structures in the front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; merely by sending a common control command, independent of transmission media, an IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> suitable for an individual transmission medium can be manufactured merely by altering the front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; of which hardware and software can be altered according to a transmission medium, which may enhance its convenience for engineers in designing an IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Note that, the foregoing embodiment has described the case where the front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives the satellite broadcasting waves and the MPEG transport distributed using an arbitrary carrier frequency out of the satellite broadcasting waves is outputted outside the front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (that is, the case where a transmission medium is a digital satellite broadcasting system), and the case where the front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; receives the CATV broadcasting waves and the MPEG 2 transport distributed using an arbitrary carrier frequency out of the CATV broadcasting waves is outputted outside the front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; (that is, the case where a transmission medium is a CATV broadcasting system).

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> That is to say, in the case of receiving communications satellite broadcasting waves, for example, and outputting the MPEG 2 transport stream distributed using an arbitrary carrier frequency out of the communications satellite broadcasting waves to outside of the front end, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the control application program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime;B (namely, a program stored in the prescribed memory inside the microcomputer) includes (stores) various programs in advance at the manufacturing stages of the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to output the MPEG 2 transport stream distributed using a carrier frequency allocated to each channel of the CS broadcasting waves to outside of the front end. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In this manner at the manufacturing stages of an IRD, a control application program (namely, a program stored in the prescribed memory inside the microcomputer) can include (store) various programs in advance to output the MPEG 2 transport stream distributed using a carrier frequency allocated to each channel of the transmission media to outside of the front end, according to a transmission medium of outputting an MPEG 2 transport stream to outside of the front end, out of the transmission media. Thus the IRD may be applied to a variety of transmission media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Also, the foregoing embodiment has described the case of receiving the satellite broadcasting waves or the CATV broadcasting waves in Japan and outputting the MPEG 2 transport stream that is distributed using an arbitrary carrier frequency out of the satellite broadcasting waves or the CATV broadcasting waves to outside of the front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. However, the present invention is not limited to it, and may be applied to other zones including U.S.A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In this case, at the manufacturing stages of an IRD, depending upon a zone where the IRD is used, a control application program (namely, a program stored in the prescribed memory (not shown in figure) inside the microcomputer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) includes (stores) various programs in advance to output outside of the front end the MPEG 2 transport stream distributed using a carrier frequency allocated to each channel of the transmission media in the specific zone. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Since the data processing unit (CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) can control the hardware structures inside the front end merely by sending a common control command, independent of a zone where a digital broadcast is received, an IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> suitable for a zone where a digital broadcast is received can be manufactured merely by altering the front end of which hardware and software can be altered according to a zone where the digital broadcast is received, which may increase the convenience for engineers in designing an IRD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Also, the foregoing embodiment has described the case where a program corresponding to one transmission medium (the satellite broadcast or the CATV) is stored in advance into a prescribed memory (not shown in figure) inside the microcomputer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime;). However, the present invention is not limited to this, and a program which corresponds to a plurality of transmission media and is applicable to various zones where IRDs are used may be stored in advance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In this case, a program regarding a demodulating method, for example, for each transmission medium and zone as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> are stored into the control application program (namely, a program stored in the prescribed memory (not shown in figure) inside the microcomputer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) at the manufacturing stages of an IRD. Also, the IRD is provided with a demodulator to perform the demodulating process for a plurality of transmission media, at the manufacturing stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the case where the same program is broadcasted by both of the satellite broadcast and CATV broadcast for example, that is, in the case where the parts dependent on a transmission medium such as a transmission frequency and a modulation method only are different and the contents of an MPEG 2 transport stream are the same except for information (frequency information and information regarding modulation method, etc.) relating to transmission, the front end performs demodulation for a modulating method (e.g., QPSK, 8PSK modulation) corresponding to the satellite broadcast when receiving the satellite broadcast, while it performs demodulation for a modulation method (e.g., 64QAM modulation) corresponding to the CATV broadcast when receiving the CATV broadcast. In the case where the demodulator can cope with the modulating methods of the satellite broadcast and the CATV broadcast and a control application program stores in advance a program which can handle the both methods, an IRD is to be common for the satellite broadcast and CATV broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As described above, since the control application program (namely, a program stored in a prescribed memory (not shown in figure) inside the microcomputer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) can include (store) in advance a program corresponding to a plurality of transmission media according to a zone where the transmission medium is received, at the manufacturing stages of an IRD, in the case where a demodulator which corresponds to the demodulating processing of a plurality of transmission media is installed at the manufacturing stages of an IRD, demodulation can be performed according to the transmission media no matter where zone the IRD is used, or no matter what a transmission medium is received in a zone where the IRD is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation is given on a digital broadcast receiving system in the case of receiving ground digital broadcasting waves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a structural example of a digital broadcast receiving system for receiving and processing ground digital broadcasting waves in addition to the BS broadcasts. In this instance, connected to an IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime; with an IEEE 1394 serial bus <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> based on the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 1394 is a ground digital receiving adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> (called &ldquo;ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>&rdquo; hereinafter) including a front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> to be described later) comprising a tuner <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, a demodulator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and an error corrector <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to process ground digital broadcasting waves received via the antenna <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, so that a user can watch not only the satellite digital broadcasts but also the ground digital broadcasts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> An IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime; capable of processing the ground digital broadcasting waves is structured as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime; has an IEEE serial bus interface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to perform the interface process to give and receive information to and from another device (in this instance, the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>) through an IEEE1394 serial bus <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Other parts of the structure are the same as those of the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a structural example of the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> loads a program stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> on RAM <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> based on a control command given from the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime;, to control the creation process of a transport stream in a ground wave front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. A transport stream created in the ground wave front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is supplied to the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the IEEE1394 serial bus interface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and IEEE1394 serial bus <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, explanation is given on the operations of these devices. When a user operates the remote controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) to specify the 20th channel as a desired channel for example out of the digital broadcasting waves in Japan shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the specified command is outputted and superimposed onto an infrared signal S<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by the IR transmitting unit of the remote controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The outputted infrared signal S<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is received by the IR receiving unit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which transmits the reception result to the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> creates a control command in accordance with the command specified with the remote controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> controls the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> indirectly through the IEEE1394 serial bus <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> using the control command so as to receive the carrier frequency of the 20th channel specified by the user out of the digital broadcasting waves, via the antenna <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, whereby supplying an MPEG 2 transport stream distributed to the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> There are, as a control command created by the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>: a DSIT (Direct Select Information Type) command to make a notice of the frequency (frequency of a user-desired channel) of the ground digital broadcasting waves that the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> has to receive; a command (Tuner States Descriptor) to recognize the state of the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>; and a command (Tuner Subnit Identifier Descriptor) to recognize the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. These commands are regulated by the &ldquo;BS Digital Broadcast Receiving Apparatus Standard Specifications&rdquo; (Version ARID STD-B21 1.1). Note that, in a ground digital broadcast receiving system according to the present invention, a command created by the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&Prime; are converted into a data format recognizable for the ground front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, by applying processing such as addition of lacked data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a diagram explaining the transmission and reception relationship of information including command information between the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and other devices (the front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). When a user selects a program carried upon the satellite digital broadcasting waves with the remote controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the transmitting and receiving processes as described above are performed on information by the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and front end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when a program to be carried upon the ground digital broadcasting waves is selected, the following processes are conducted by the CPU <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> That is, the OS <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>C makes the application program <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A create a control command to supply the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) with an MPEG 2 transport stream distributed using a carrier frequency allocated to the 20th channel of the ground digital broadcasting waves, transfers it to an interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>D to notify the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>D transfers the control command to the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> through the IEEE1394 serial bus <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As in the case of the IRD <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the CPU functional unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>X of the CPU <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the ground adapter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> comprises an application program <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A, an interface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B, an OS <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>C, and an interface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>D. The interface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>D supplies the control command transferred from the interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>D, to the application program <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The application program <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A applies processes such as affixing of lacked data to the control command to convert it into a control command recognizable for the ground front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, under the control of the OS <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>C. The application program <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A transfers to the interface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B the control command in the form of data format recognizable for the ground wave front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, to notify the ground front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The interface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B transfers the control commands processed by the application program <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A, to the control application program <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B via the interface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A, following the given procedure, in accordance with a communication protocol which is called I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>C between the interface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the ground wave front end <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the interface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The driver <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>C converts the contents of the program transferred from the control application program <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B into a data format recognizable for the hardware (the tuner <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the demodulator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and the error corrector <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>), to control the hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> That is, the tuner <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> selects the carrier frequency of the 20th channel by performing the tuning process on a ground digital broadcast wave RF received via the antenna <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, mixes the selected carrier frequency with the local frequency to obtain an intermediate frequency S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (image frequency of 513.25 MHz, audio frequency of 517.75 MHz in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) which is then sent to the demodulator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The demodulator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> takes out a data line D<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by performing the demodulating process based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) method which is a demodulating method corresponding to the ground digital broadcasting waves, on the intermediate frequency S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supplied from the tuner <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, and sends it out to the error corrector <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The error corrector <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> performs processes such as the error detection on the data line D<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> supplied from the demodulator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> using a data line allocated in advance.

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> performs the descrambling process on the supplied transport stream (D<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) in the buffer memory <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> using a de-scramble key supplied from the IC card <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, to output the extracted video data (D<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) to the MPEG video decoder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and to output the audio data (D<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>) to the MPEG data decoder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.
