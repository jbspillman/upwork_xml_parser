<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to optical scanning devices, imaging apparatuses, and imaging methods, and more particularly to an optical scanning device including a plurality of scanning optical systems having a plurality of light sources and arranged in a main scanning direction, an imaging apparatus forming an image by means of such an optical scanning device, and an imaging method using such an optical scanning device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An optical scanning device scanning a surface to be scanned (a scanned surface) with a light beam from a light source deflected by a deflector and passing through a scanning optical element can cover a large scanning area by dividing the scanned surface in a main scanning direction even if the optical scanning device is compact. Further, since the optical scanning device has each of its scanning optical systems and scanning optical elements reduced in size, it becomes easy to correct wave front aberration correlated greatly with a beam spot diameter so that a variation in the beam spot diameter due to a component variation or a component attachment error can be minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the scanning optical system can have a higher scanning rate by including a plurality of light beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, if the scanned surface is divided in the main scanning direction, a deviation between recording positions at the joint of scanning areas causes image degradation. Further, if each scanning optical system employs a plurality of light beams, it is difficult to match the recording positions in a sub scanning direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 10-246861 discloses an apparatus that correct the joint of scanning areas in the main scanning direction by controlling the recording timing of one of a pair of laser scanning optical systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, if each of the laser scanning optical systems employs a plurality of light beams, recording positions are prevented from being matched in the sub scanning direction with high accuracy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the optical scanning device can perform scanning with the scanning start and end positions being matched also in the main scanning direction with high accuracy at the joint of the scanning areas. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the above-described imaging method, one of the light sources of the one of the scanning optical systems which one includes the light source selection part is selected so as to minimize a deviation in the sub scanning direction between scanning start and end positions in the scanning area of the one of the scanning optical systems and a scanning area adjacent thereto at the joint of the two scanning areas.

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thereby, scanning can be performed with the scanning start and end positions being matched also in the main scanning direction with high accuracy at the joint of the scanning areas.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A description will now be given, with respect to the accompanying drawings, of an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a configuration of an imaging apparatus according to the present invention. The imaging apparatus includes an optical scanning device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a charging device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a developing device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a transfer charging device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a fixing device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and a cleaner <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The imaging apparatus employs a well-known principle of image formation. That is, the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is uniformly charged by the charging device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, has its electrical potential reduced in accordance with a distribution of exposure formed by the optical scanning device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photosensitive body. Then, the developing device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes the toner to adhere to the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The toner adhering to the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, after being transferred to a paper sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the transfer charging device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, is melted and fixed on the paper sheet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the fixing device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The cleaner <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> removes residual toner from the surface (a surface to be scanned or a scanned surface) of the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The scanning optical systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> include semiconductor laser arrays <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, coupling lenses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, apertures <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, cylindrical lenses <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, polygon scanners (deflectors) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, scanning lenses <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, bending mirrors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, respectively. A light-receiving element <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is a component common to the scanning optical systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The scanning optical systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are arranged in a main scanning direction so that their respective scanning areas <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the surface of the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are connected side by side in the main scanning direction by a joint <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Each of the semiconductor laser arrays <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes four light sources LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through LD<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> emitting light beams that are modulated separately from one another in accordance with image data by light source driving circuits <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the scanning optical systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively. Each of the light source driving circuits <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> employs a well-known configuration in the field of multi-beam scanning techniques in addition to any of configurations corresponding to later-described <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</cross-reference>. The light beams emitted from the light sources LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through LD<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor laser arrays <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are coupled by the coupling lenses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. Here, the light beams coupled by the coupling lens <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the scanning optical system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are referred to as a first light beam, and the light beams coupled by the coupling lens <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the scanning optical system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are referred to as a second light beam. Thereafter, the first and second light beams pass through the apertures <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the cylindrical lenses <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, each of which has power in the sub scanning direction, to be focused into line images long in the main scanning direction on the polygon scanners <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or in the vicinities thereof, respectively. Further, the first and second light beams are deflected by the polygon scanners <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to pass through the scanning lenses <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The polygon scanners <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are rotated in the same direction by a driving mechanism (not shown in the drawing) to deflect the first and second light beams so that the first and second light beams of the scanning optical systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> scan the surface of the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> equally in the main scanning direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are disposed in positions on which the first and second light beams that have passed through the scanning lenses <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are made incident before reaching the bending mirrors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The first and second light beams reflected back from the mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are made incident on the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, respectively. The light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> receive and detect the first and second light beams from the scanning lenses <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to generate synchronizing detection signals indicating the start of each scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The first and second light beams, after reaching the bending mirrors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, are bent in a direction toward the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be incident thereon so that the light beams emitted from the light sources LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through LD<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of each of the first and second light beams scan given scanning areas with a given distance kept in the sub scanning direction between each adjacent two of the light beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are disposed in positions on which the first and second light beams are made incident after scanning the given scanning areas. The first and second light beams reflected back from the mirrors <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are made incident on the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, respectively. The light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> receive and detect the first and second light beams from the scanning lenses <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to generate synchronizing detection signals indicating the end of each scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The light source driving circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the scanning optical system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of measuring a period of scanning time between a time at which the first light beam is received by the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a time at which the first light beam is received by the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, using the results of detection of the first light beam by the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the light source driving circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the scanning optical system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is capable of measuring a period of scanning time between a time at which the second light beam is received by the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a time at which the second light beam is received by the light-receiving element <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> by means of the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The scanning optical systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> control respective recording start times based on times at which the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> detect the first and second light beams. Therefore, the light sources LD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through LD <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the scanning optical systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are switched off between the times at which the light-receiving elements <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> detect the first and second light beams and the recording start times so as to prevent the first and second light beams from being incident on the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and forming a latent image. Once recording is started, the scanning optical systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> perform drawing modulation such as on-off keying or intensity modulation on the first and second light beams and scan the surface of the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> rotated by the driving mechanism so as to form a desired latent image on the surface of the photosensitive body <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
