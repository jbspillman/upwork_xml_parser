<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to small molecule inhibitors of the IgE response to allergens that are useful in the treatment of allergy and/or asthma or any diseases where IgE is pathogenic </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An estimated 10 million persons in the United States have asthma, about 5% of the population. The estimated cost of asthma in the United States exceeds $6 billion. About 25% of patients with asthma who seek emergency care require hospitalization, and the largest single direct medical expenditure for asthma has been inpatient hospital services (emergency care), at a cost of greater than $1.6 billion. The cost for prescription medications, which increased 54% between 1985 and 1990, was close behind at $1.1 billion (Kelly <highlight><italic>Pharmacotherapy </italic></highlight>12:13S-21S (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, asthma accounts of all ambulatory care visits, and the disease continues to be a significant cause of missed school days in children. Despite improved understanding of the disease process and better drugs, asthma morbidity and mortality continue to rise in this country and worldwide (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; 1991, publication no. 91-3042). Thus, asthma constitutes a significant public health problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The pathophysiologic processes that attend the onset of an asthmatic episode can be broken down into essentially two phases, both marked by bronchoconstriction, that causes wheezing, chest tightness, and dyspnea. The first, early phase asthmatic response is triggered by allergens, irritants, or exercise. Allergens cross-link immunoglobin E (IgE) molecules bound to receptors on mast cells, causing them to release a number of pre-formed inflammatory mediators, including histamine. Additional triggers include the osmotic changes in airway tissues following exercise or the inhalation of cold, dry air. The second, late phase response that follows is characterized by infiltration of activated eosinophils and other inflammatory cells into airway tissues, epithelial desquamonon, and by the presence of highly viscous mucus within the airways. The damage caused by this inflammatory response leaves the airways &ldquo;primed&rdquo; or sensitized, such that smaller triggers are required to elicit subsequent asthma symptoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A number of drugs are available for the palliative treatment of asthma; however, their efficacies vary markedly. Short-acting &bgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-adrenergic agonists, terbutaline and albuterol, long the mainstay of asthma treatment, act primarily during the early phase as bronchodilators. The newer long-acting &bgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-agonists, salmeterol and formoterol, may reduce the bronchoconstrictive component of the late response. However, because the &bgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;agonists do not possess significant antiinflammatory activity, they have no effect on bronchial hyperreactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Numerous other drugs target specific aspects of the early or late asthmatic responses. For example, antihistamines, like loratadine, inhibit early histamine-mediated inflammatory responses. Some of the newer antihistamines, such as azelastine and ketotifen, may have both antuinflammatory and weak bronchodilatory effects, but they currently do not have any established efficacy in asthma treatment. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, like theophylline/xanthines, may attenuate late inflammatory responses, but there is no evidence that these compounds decrease bronchial hyperreactivity. Anticholinergics, like ipratopium bromide, which are used in cases of acute asthma to inhibit severe bronchoconstriction, have no effect on early or late phase inflammation, no effect on bronchial hyperreactivity, and therefore, essentially no role in chronic therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The corticosteroid drugs, like budesonide, are the most potent antiinflammatory agents. Inflammatory mediator release inhibitors, like cromolyn and nedocromil, act by stabilizing mast cells and thereby inhibiting the late phase inflammatory response to allergen. Thus, cromolyn and nedocromil, as well as the corticosteroids, all reduce bronchial hyperreactivity by minimizing the sensitizing effect of inflammatory damage to the airways. Unfortunately, these antuinflammatory agents do not produce bronchodilation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Several new agents are currently being developed that inhibit specific aspects of asthmatic inflanmmation. For instance, leukotriene receptor antagonists (ICI-204, 219, accolate), specifically inhibit leukotriene-mediated actions. The leukotrienes have been implicated in the production of both airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, while numerous drugs are currently available for the treatment of asthma, these compounds are primarily palliative and/or have significant side effects. Consequently, new therapeutic approaches which target the underlying cause rather than the cascade of symptoms would be highly desirable. Asthma and allergy share a common dependence on IgE-mediated events. Indeed, it is known that excess IgE production is the underlying cause of allergies in general and allergic asthma in particular (Duplantier and Cheng, <highlight><italic>Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>29:73-81 (1994)). Thus, compounds that lower IgE levels may be effective in treating the underlying cause of asthma and allergy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> None of the current therapies eliminate the excess circulating IgE. The hypothesis that lowering plasma IgE may reduce the allergic response, was confirmed by recent clinical results with chimeric anti-IgE antibody, CGP-51901, and recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, rhuMAB-E25. Indeed, three companies, Tanox Biosystems, Inc., Genentech Inc. and Novartis AG are collaborating in the development of a humanized anti-IgE antibody (BioWorld&reg; Today, Feb. 26, 1997, p. 2) which will treat allergy and asthma by neutralizing excess IgE. Tanox has already successfully tested the anti-IgE antibody, CGP-51901, which reduced the severity and duration of nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis in a 155-patient Phase II trial (Scrip &num;2080, Nov 24, 1995, p.26). Genentech recently disclosed positive results from a 536 patient phase-II/III trials of its recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, rhuMAB-E25 (BioWorld&reg;) Today, Nov. 10, 1998, p. 1). The antibody, rhuMAB-E25, administered by injection (highest dose 300 mg every 2 to 4 weeks as needed) provided a 50% reduction in the number of days a patient required additional &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; medicines (antihistimines and decongestants), compared to placebo. An NDA filing for this product is projected to be in the year 2000. The positive results from anti-IgE antibody trials suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at IgE down- regulation may be effective. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to small molecule inhibitors of IgE (synthesis and/or release) which are useful in the treatment of allergy and/or asthma or any diseases where IgE is pathogenic. The particular compounds disclosed herein were identified by their ability to suppress IgE levels in both ex vivo and in vivo assays. Development and optimization of clinical treatment regimens can be monitored by those of skill in the art by reference to the ex vivo and in vivo assays described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Ex Vivo Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This assay begins with in vivo antigen priming and measures secondary antibody responses in vitro. The basic protocol was documented and optimized for a range of parameters including: antigen dose for priming and time span following priming, number of cells cultured in vitro, antigen concentrations for eliciting secondary IgE (and other Ig&apos;s) response in vitro, fetal bovine serum (FBS) batch that will permit optimal IgE response in vitro, the importance of primed CD4&plus; T cells and hapten-specific B cells, and specificity of the ELISA assay for IgE (Marcelletti and Katz, Cellular Immunology 135:471-489 (1991); incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The actual protocol utilized for this project was adapted for a more high throughput analyses. BALB/cB3y mice were immunized i.p. with 10 pg DNP-KLH adsorbed onto 4 mg alum and sacrificed after 15 days. Spleens were excised and homogenized in a tissue grinder, washed twice, and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 pg/ml streptomycin and 0.0005% 2-mercaptoethanol. Spleen cell cultures were established (2-3 million cells/ml, 0.2 ml/well in quadruplicate, 96-well plates) in the presence or absence of DNP-KLH (10 ng/ml). Test compounds (2 pg/ml and 50 ng/ml) were added to the spleen cell cultures containing antigen and incubated at 37&deg; C. for 8 days in an atmosphere of 10% CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Culture supernatants were collected after 8 days and Ig&apos;s were measured by a modification of the specific isotype-selective ELISA assay described by Marcelletti and Katz (Supra). The assay was modified to facilitate high throughput. ELISA plates were prepared by coating with DNP-KLH overnight. After blocking with bovine serum albumin (BSA), an aliquot of each culture supernatant was diluted (1:4 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with BSA, sodium azide and Tween 20), added to the ELISA plates, and incubated overnight in a humidified box at 4&deg; C. IgE levels were quantitated following successive incubations with biotinylated-goat antimouse IgE (b-GAME), AP-streptavidin and substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Antigen-specific IgGI was measured similarly, except that culture supernatants were diluted 200-fold and biotinylated-goat antimouse IgGI (b-GAMG1) was substituted for b-GAME. IgG2<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>was measured in ELISA plates that were coated with DNP-KLH following a 1:20 dilution of culture supernatants and incubation with biotinylated-goat antimouse IgG2<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(b-GAMG2<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Quantitation of each isotype was determined by comparison to a standard curve. The level of detectability of all antibody was about 200-400 pg/ml and there was less than 0.001% cross-reactivity with any other Ig isotype in the ELISA for IgE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In Vivo Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Compounds found to be active in the ex vivo assay (above) were further tested for their activity in suppressing IgE responses in vivo. Mice receiving low- dose radiation prior to immunization with a carrier exhibited an enhanced IgE response to sensitization with antigen 7 days later. Administration of the test compounds immediately prior to and after antigen sensitization, measured the ability of that drug to suppress the IgE response. The levels of IgE, IgGI and IgG2<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in serum were compared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Female BALB/cByj mice were irradiated with 250 rads 7 hours after initiation of the daily light cycle. Two hours later, the mice were immunized i.p. with 2 pg of KLH in 4 mg alum. Two to seven consecutive days of drug injections were initiated 6 days later on either a once or twice daily basis. Typically, i.p. injections and oral gavages were administered as suspensions (150 p/injection) in saline with 10% ethanol and 0.25% methylcellulose. Each treatment group was composed of 5-6 mice. On the second day of drug administration, 2 pg of DNP-KLH was administered i.p. in 4 mg alum, immediately following the morning injection of drug. Mice were bled 7-21 days following DNP-KLH challenge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Antigen-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>antibodies were measured by ELISA. Periorbital bleeds were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supematants were diluted 5-fold in saline, and centrifuged again. Antibody concentrations of each bleed were determined by ELISA of four dilutions (in triplicate) and compared to a standard curve: anti- DNP IgE (1:100 to 1:800), anti-DNP IgG2a (1:100 to 1:800), and anti-DNP IgGI (1:1600 to 1:12800). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Suppression of IgE Response </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The inhibitory activity of the small molecules of the present invention were assayed using both the ex vivo and in vivo assays as described above. All of the compounds presented above were active in suppressing the IgE response. In the ex vivo assay, compounds in genuses I-XI produced 50% inhibition at concentrations ranging from I pM to 100 tM. In the in vivo assay, the compounds were effective at concentrations ranging from less than about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day, when administered in divided doses (e.g., two to four times daily) for at least two to seven consecutive days. Thus, the small molecule inhibitors of the present invention are disclosed as being useful in lowering the antigen-induced increase in IgE concentration, and consequently, in the treatment of IgE- dependent processes such as allergies in general and allergic asthma in particular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Treatment Regimens </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The amount of the IgE inhibitor compound which may be effective in treating a particular allergy or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in a given situation will also depend on the choice of compound and the seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient&apos;s circumstances. Appropriate dosages can be determined and adjusted by the practitioner based on dose response relationships between the patient&apos;s IgE levels as well as standard indices of pulmonary and hemodynamic changes. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that dose ranges can be determined without undue experimentation by following the protocol(s) disclosed herein for ex vivo and in vivo screening (See for example Hasegawa et al., J. Med. Chem. 40: 395-407 (1997) and Olunori et al., Int. J Immunopharmacol 15:573-579 (1993); employing similar ex vivo and in vivo assays for determining dose-response relationships for IgE suppression by naphthalene derivatives; incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Initially, suitable dosages of the compounds will generally range from about 0.001 mg to about 300 mg per kg body weight per day in divided doses, more preferably, between about 0.01 mg and 100 mg per kg body weight per day in divided doses. The compounds are preferably administered systemically as pharmaceutical formulations appropriate to such routes as oral, aerosol, intravenous, subcutaneously, or by any other route which may be effective in providing systemic dosing of the active compound. The compositions of pharmaceutical formulations are well known in the art. The treatment regimen preferably involves periodic administration. Moreover, long-term therapy may be indicated where allergic reactions appear to be triggered by continuous exposure to the allergen(s). Daily or twice daily administration has been effective in suppressing the IgE response to a single antigen challenge in animals when carried out continuously from a period of two to seven consecutive days. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the compound is administered for at least two consecutive days at regular periodic intervals. However, the treatment regimen, including frequency of dosing and duration of treatment may be determined by the skilled practitioner, and modified as needed to provide optimal IgE down-regulation, depending on nature of the allergen, the dose, frequency, and duration of the allergen exposure, and the standard clinical indices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, an IgE-suppressing compound may be administered in conjunction with one or more of the other small molecule inhibitors disclosed, in order to produce optimal down-regulation of the patient&apos;s IgE response. Further, it is envisioned that one or more of the compounds of the present invention may be administered in combination with other drugs already known or later discovered for treatment of the underlying cause as well as the acute symptoms of allergy or asthma. Such combination therapies envisioned within the scope of the present invention include mixing of one or more of the small molecule IgE-inhibitors together with one or more additional ingredients, known to be effective in reducing at least one symptom of the disease condition. In a variation, the small molecule IgE-inhibitors herein disclosed may be administered separately from the additional drugs, but during the same course of the disease condition, wherein both the IgE-inhibitor(s) and the palliative compounds are administered in accordance with their independent effective treatment regimens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> While a number of preferred embodiments of the invention and variations thereof have been described in detail, other modifications and methods of use will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. Accordingly, it should be understood that various applications, modifications and substitutions may be made of equivalents without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
