<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A short duration of exposure is selected for the object for EVEN fields and a long duration of exposure is selected for the object for ODD fields by the electronic shutter, the obtained images being subsequently synthetically combined according to a synthetic reference levels in a dynamic range broadening mode. For the EVEN field, the duration of exposure is automatically controlled according to the brightness for high speed shutter operation. The level of REF is lowered when a small value is selected for the duration of exposure whereas the level of REF is raised when a large value is selected for the duration of exposure. In the case of a dark object that does not require any dynamic range, REF rises to get to the white clip level, when the mode is switched to an ordinary mode to increase the duration of exposure for both EVEN fields and ODD fields. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an image pickup device and a video signal processing method that can suitably be used in a monitoring video camera. More particularly, the present invention relates to the technology for broadening the dynamic range of a video signal so that the picked up image of the object including dark areas and bright areas may be clearly viewed with a sufficient contrast (gradation) effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, the image pickup device that is used in a monitoring video camera typically comprises an image pickup element such as a CCD (charge-coupled device) and the video signal obtained from the image pickup element is subjected to a predetermined signal processing operation (KNEE, gamma, detail, white balance, etc.) to produce a final video signal to be used for producing an image of the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, image pickup devices such as CCDs generally show a narrow dynamic range and hence it is difficult to pick up an image of an object having a large difference of luminance between the dark areas and the bright areas thereof. Techniques for broadening the dynamic range by adding or synthesizing two video signals obtained from an object in different imaging conditions and weighted appropriately in order to alleviate the above identified problem are known. An image pickup device disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2000-209492 (to be referred to as the first prior art document hereinafter) will be briefly described below as one of such known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to the first prior art document, an image pickup device is adapted to obtain sequentially a first video signal for an image picked up by appropriately opening the diaphragm and a second video signal for an image picked up by narrowing the opening of the diaphragm. Then, the first video signal is compressed to a specified amplitude level. In the case where the compressed signal exceeds a threshold value that represents a predetermined brightness, the compressed first video signal is attenuated by using a predetermined coefficient while the second signal is amplified by using another predetermined coefficient and then the two signals are added to produce a video signal showing a broad dynamic range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other prior art techniques for broadening the dynamic range of a video signal are disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 10-233966 (to be referred to as the second prior art document hereinafter) and Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-164195 (to be referred to as the third prior art document hereinafter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An image pickup device according to the second prior art document is adapted to obtain sequentially two video signals with different extents of exposure to light by means of an image pickup element that is a CCD. Then, the video signal obtained with the smaller extent of exposure is corrected for gradation and the corrected signal is synthetically combined with the video signal that is obtained with the larger extent of exposure in order to provide the final video signal with a sufficient gradation effect for bright areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Now, an image pickup device according to the third prior art document is adapted to obtain sequentially two video signals respectively with a long exposure time and a short exposure time and hence with different brightness levels, which two video signals are then synthetically combined to produce a final video signal by using a composite function selected out of a predetermined number of composite functions depending on if the maximum luminance level exceeds a reference value or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, with any of the image pickup devices according to the above cited first through third prior art documents, while high luminance areas provide a sufficient gradation effect, the obtained image can provide only a poor contrast effect when an object having a narrow dynamic range is picked up. This is because the video signal of an image picked up with a scarcely opened diaphragm (and hence with a small extent of exposure to light) does not provide a satisfactory level of luminance so that the video signal of a corresponding image picked up with a normally opened diaphragm (and hence with a relatively large extent of exposure to light) is compressed to below the predetermined reference level although no signal will be practically added thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Additionally, when an image of an object showing a broad dynamic range is picked up, the parts of the signal obtained by addition show a fixed dynamic range to make the bright areas of the produced final image show only a poor contrast effect because the video signal of the image picked up with a normally opened diaphragm (and hence with a relatively large extent of exposure to light) is compressed to a fixed reference level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, a system of obtaining two video signals sequentially under different exposure conditions provides an effect of broadening the dynamic range at low cost when it is applied to a conventional system for synthetically combining images obtained with different electronic exposure durations (a long exposure time of 1/60 seconds and a short exposure time) by using a CCD and a signal processing IC. However, the image obtained by means of such a system provides a vertical resolution that is only a half of the vertical resolution of an ordinary image (obtained by an ordinary imaging operation without the synthesizing process) and the number of images picked up per unit time is halved (e.g., 60 images per second to 30 images per second). This means that a jerkily and strangely moving image showing a low vertical resolution may be obtained from an object that does not require a wide dynamic range. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Now, the present invention will be described in greater detail by referring to the accompanying drawing that illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of image pickup device according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference symbol <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a lens diaphragm for regulating the extent of exposure of the image pickup device when picking up an image of an object. The opening of the lens diaphragm <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be controlled so as to regulate the extent of exposure stepwise. The image picked up with the extent of exposure controlled as a function of the opening of the lens diaphragm <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is led to image pickup element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprising a CCD and then subjected to photoelectric conversion by the image pickup element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that it is transformed into an analog video signal. The image pickup element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with an electronic shutter that can be operated stepwise for controlling the duration of exposure. Thus, the extent of exposure can be defined by controlling the opening of the lens diaphragm <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the image pickup element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and/or the duration of exposure. However, assume here that the extent of exposure is defined by controlling the duration of exposure for an image picked up by operating the shutter at high speed and by controlling the opening of the lens diaphragm for an image picked up by operating the shutter at low speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The analog video signals produced from the image pickup element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the selected respective extents of exposure are then transformed into a digital video signal by means of a sample/hold circuit (S/H) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and an analog/digital converter (A/D) <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and subjected to a predetermined video signal processing operation (KNEE, gamma, detail, white balance, etc.) by signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> extracts data on the brightness of the video signal picked up with a smaller extent of exposure and outputs the data to brightness detection circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The brightness detection circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> detects either the integrated value or the peak value of the brightness of the entire image or a predetermined region of the image from the input data on the brightness and outputs the obtained value to control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> comprises a CPU among others and controls the opening of the lens diaphragm <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the duration of exposure for the shutter of the image pickup element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the switching operation of switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which will be described hereinafter, according to the brightness detection data input from the brightness detection circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> determines reference level REF <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for controlling compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which will be described hereinafter, and reference level REF <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for controlling compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which will also be described hereinafter. As a result, it controls the compression ratio of the former circuit and the compression or expansion ratio of the latter circuit. Furthermore, the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> generates an image quality control signal for controlling image quality control circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which will also be described hereinafter, according to the brightness detection data input to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the operation of the image quality control circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be controlled by the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at a predetermined timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The video signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> output from the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is input to a single image memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> adapted to store only a single image. The single image memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is designed to delay the input video signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by a period of time corresponding to a single image. The video signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> produced from the single image memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with the delay time is fed to fixed terminals a<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the video signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> output from the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is fed directly to the fixed terminals b<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> without delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, said single image memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises a first memory block A and a second memory block B, each of which has a memory capacity corresponding to the video signal of a single image, along with switches SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for respectively selecting the input and the output of either of the memory blocks A and B. The read/write operation of each of the memory blocks A, B and the switching operation of each of the switches SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are controlled by means of memory control signals output from the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Note that a video signal representing an image obtained with a large extent of exposure by operating the shutter at high speed is expressed by VS, whereas a video signal representing an image obtained with a small extent of exposure by operating the shutter at low speed is expressed by VF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is controlled by the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for its switching operation in such a way that movable terminal c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is alternately connected to fixed terminals a<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and b<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, while movable terminal c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is alternately connected to fixed terminals a<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and b<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. With this arrangement, video signal VS representing an image obtained with a large extent of exposure is output from the terminal cl and video signal VF representing an image obtained with a small extent of exposure is output form the terminal c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The video signal VS output from the terminal c<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is input to the compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> by way of the image quality control circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and subjected to a compression processing operation in the compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> according to the control signal from the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The video signal obtained as a result of the compression processing operation is denoted by VS&prime;. Similarly, the video signal VF output from the terminal c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is input to the compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and subjected to a compression/expansion processing operation in the compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> according to the control signal from the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The video signal obtained as a result of the compression/expansion processing operation is denoted by VF&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The compression ratio of the compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is controlled by the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This control is denoted by REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> control hereinafter. The compression/expansion ratio of the compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is also controlled by the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This control is denoted by REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> control hereinafter. REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> control and REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> control will be described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The video signal VS&prime; output from the compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the video signal VF&prime; output from the compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are added by the adder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and then the sum signal is input to NTSC encoder <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and encoded into an NTSC signal. The NTSC signal is converted into an analog video signal by digital/analog converter (D/A) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and output as final video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Now, the operation of controlling the embodiment having the above configuration will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, it is so arranged that the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can change the synthetic reference levels REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to control the ratio to be used for synthetically combining the video signals VS&prime; and VF&prime; according to the brightness detection data input to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If the input video signal is determined to be a one with a small extent of exposure on the basis of the input data on the brightness, the brightness detection circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> raised the reference levels REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the video signal produced from the adder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may contain the video signal VS&prime; obtained by the low speed shutter at a high ratio. With this arrangement, it is possible to provide an optimal contrast for an image of a dark object showing a narrow dynamic range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, the input video signal is determined to be a one with a large extent of exposure on the basis of the input data on the brightness, the brightness detection circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> lowers the reference levels REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that the video signal produced from the adder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may contain the video signal VF&prime; obtained by the high speed shutter at a high ratio. With this arrangement, it is possible to provide an optimal contrast for an image of a bright object showing a wide dynamic range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of an addition signal that can be obtained by variably controlling the reference levels in the embodiment. Now, the control of the addition signal will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the output level of the video signal VS obtained by operating the shutter at low speed and output from the switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may rise according to the extent of exposure of the image pickup element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and eventually gets to a saturation level corresponding to the maximum output level of the image pickup element. So is the output level of the video signal VF obtained by operating the shutter at high speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As the video signal VS obtained by operating the shutter at low speed is input, the compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> compares the level of the video signal VS with the reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> given from the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and it outputs the video signal VS without modifying it if the level of the video signal VS is lower than the reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, whereas it compresses the video signal VS to video signal VS&prime; and outputs the latter signal if the level of the video signal VS is not lower than the reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) indicates an instance where the reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is lowered because of a large extent of exposure and (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) indicates an instance where the reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is raised because of a small extent of exposure. Thus, video signal VS&prime; (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is output from the compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> when the reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is lowered, whereas video signal VS&prime; (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is output from the compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> when the reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as the video signal VF obtained by operating the shutter at high speed is input, the compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> compares the level of the video signal VF with the reference level REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> given from the control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and it cuts out the output if the level of the video signal VF is lower than the reference level REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, whereas it reduces the level of the video signal VF to the level of REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to produce video signal VF&prime; and outputs the latter signal. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) indicates an instance where the reference level REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is lowered because of a large extent of exposure and (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) indicates an instance where the reference level REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is raised because of a small extent of exposure. Thus, video signal VF&prime; (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is output from the compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> when the reference level REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is raised, whereas video signal VF&prime; (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is output from the compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> when the reference level REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Thus, the sum signal output from the adder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is obtained by adding the video signal VS&prime; output from the compression circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the video signal VF&prime; output from the compression/expansion circuit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The sum signal (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) will be VS&prime; (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)&plus;VF&prime; (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) when the level of REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are raised, whereas the sum signal (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) will be VS&prime; (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)&plus;VF&prime; (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) when the level of REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the level of REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and that of REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are determined not independently but in an interlocked manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Now, the operation of automatically switching from the ordinary image pickup mode to the dynamic range broadening image pickup mode or vice versa depending on the difference between bright areas and dark areas of the object will be described below. It is assumed here that the image pickup element <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is adapted to generate a video signal for 1 frame and 2 fields and either of the two different extents of exposure is selected on a field by field basis by the electronic shutter in order to make an existing image pickup element and an existing signal processing unit applicable to the embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the low speed shutter fixed to {fraction (1/60)} seconds is used for picking up an image with a large extent of exposure whereas a variable high speed shutter is used for picking up an image with a small extent of exposure. The two extents of exposure are switched from one to the other for every field. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> schematically illustrates this operation. It is assumed here that the high speed shutter is used for EVEN fields and the low speed shutter is used for ODD fields. The obtained two images are then synthetically combined by referring to the above described synthetic reference levels (REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the EVEN field, the operation of the high speed shutter is automatically controlled according to the brightness of the video signal and optimal synthetic reference levels REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are determined as a function of the duration of open shutter. More specifically, if the duration of open shutter is further reduced for the high speed shutter (because the dynamic range of the bright object being shot is broadening), the synthetic reference levels REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be lowered. If, to the contrary, the duration of open shutter is reduced for the high speed shutter (because the dynamic range of the dark object being shot is narrowing), the synthetic reference levels REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, REF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will be raised. When this control operation is conducted in a manner as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the synthetic reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is raised to the highest level for outputting a video signal (the white clip level) for a dark object requiring no dynamic range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As a result of the above control operation, the ultimate output will be the video signal obtained by the low speed shutter. Since the adder <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not operates when a level higher than the white clip level is involved, the synthetic reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that gets to the white clip level is detected and the operation is switched to the ordinary image pickup mode so that the switching operation is conducted without changing the brightness and the dynamic range and the obtained image will not be affected by the switch operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the video signal VS output from the terminal cl of the switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is input to the image quality control circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to improve the quality of the synthesized image. For example, the image quality control circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may change the gamma curve to make dark areas of the image more visible and/or control so as to make details of the image clearly visible. At this time, the value used for the improvement is made to gradually converge to the corresponding value in the ordinary image pickup mode as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As a result, the image quality will not show any noticeable change that may otherwise appear due to the change in the value used for the improvement at the time of switching over to the ordinary image pickup mode. In the instance of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the value to be used fro the improvement is controlled by means of the synthetic reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Now, the operation of controlling the single image memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the single image memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises first and second memory blocks A, B. The control circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> changes the connections of the switches SW<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, SW<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> appropriately for the ordinary image pickup mode and the dynamic range broadening image pickup mode using two extents of exposure (to be referred to as WDR image pickup mode hereinafter) to selectively use the inputs and the outputs of the memory blocks A, B and, at the same time, controls the read and write operations of the memory blocks A, B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the ordinary image pickup mode, the data already written in the first memory block A is read out while the input data is being written into it as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. The read out data is not the data being written but the data that was written in the last write session. In other words, the read out data is that of the immediately preceding field. In the next field, the data of the immediately preceding field is read out from the second memory block B while the input data is being written into it. In this way, the memory blocks A, B are accessed alternately on a field by field basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the WDR image pickup mode, an operation as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> takes place for synthetically combining the image of the immediately preceding field (taken by using the high speed shutter) and the image of the current field (taken by using the low speed shutter). More specifically, while a data is being written in the first memory block A, the data of the immediately preceding field stored in the second memory block B is read out. Thus, the synthesized image is obtained by combining the data being written in the first memory block A and the data stored in the second memory block B for the immediately preceding field. Similarly, while a data is being written in the second memory block B, the data of the immediately preceding field stored in the first memory block A is read out. Thus, the synthesized image is obtained by combining the data being written in the second memory block B and the data stored in the first memory block A for the immediately preceding field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a timing chart illustrating the memory access control for a mode switching operation of the embodiment. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, A</cross-reference>* and B** indicate time advancement. The memory comprises a first memory block A and a second memory block B. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at the time when the mode is switched from the WDR image pickup mode to the ordinary image pickup mode, the field of B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is output in the ordinary image pickup mode and hence the low speed shutter needs to be selected in order to avoid any abrupt change in the image brightness. More specifically, since the synthetic reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is actually held to the white clip level, the output of B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&plus;A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is in fact equal to A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and hence no problem arises if the shutter is switched. Then, as B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is output immediately after the switch to the ordinary image pickup mode, the brightness is made to match the low speed shutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> With the above described control operation, the mode can be switched from the WDR image pickup mode to the ordinary image pickup mode or vice versa quite smoothly without any abrupt change in the image brightness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a schematic flow chart of a mode switching operation of the embodiment. On the way, the operation is held to a status of waiting for two fields so that B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be selected reliably. While the flow chart does not show any sequence of fields for the timing of mode switching, the mode switching control operation is made to start from an EVEN field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, firstly, the synthetic reference level REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is compared with the while clip level WC (S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and, if REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gE;WC (Y), the current mode is determined to be the WDR image pickup mode (S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). If the current mode is determined to be not the WDR image pickup mode (N), the processing operation of the ordinary image pickup mode continues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, the current mode is determined to be the WDR image pickup mode (Y) in Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the duration of exposure of the electronic shutter is made equal to that of the ordinary image pickup mode (EVEN field: {fraction (1/60)} seconds, ODD field: {fraction (1/60)} seconds) (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and the status of waiting for two fields is confirmed (S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, the memory control is switched (and hence WDR is switched from ON to OFF) (S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) to proceed with the processing operation of the ordinary image pickup mode thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> If it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that REF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gE;WC does not hold true (N), then it is determined if the current mode is the WDR image pickup mode or not (S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). If it is determined that the current mode is the WDR image pickup mode (Y), the processing operation of the WDR image pickup mode is continued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> If it is determined in Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that the current mode is not the WDR image pickup mode (N), the duration of exposure of the electronic shutter is made equal to that of the WDR image pickup mode (EVEN field: automatic (high speed), ODD field: {fraction (1/60)} seconds (low speed)) (S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and the memory control is switched (and hence WDR is switched from OFF to ON) to proceed with the processing operation of the WDR image pickup mode thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> With the above described video signal processing method, an image with a broadened dynamic range is output for an object that requires a dynamic range by synthetically combining images obtained with two different extents of exposure, whereas an image obtained for each field with an ordinary extent of exposure is output without any change in the brightness for an object not requiring any dynamic range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Thus, with the system of using two different extents of exposure for each field, while the synthesized image obtained immediately after an expansion of the dynamic range shows a degraded vertical resolution and a reduced number of frames, the degradation of vertical resolution and a reduced number of frames can be avoided for the image picked up for an object that does not require any dynamic range because the mode of operation is automatically switched to the ordinary image pickup mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the above described embodiment, not only the duration of exposure but also the opening of the lens diaphragm <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be used to regulate the extent of exposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As may be clearly understood from the above description of a preferred embodiment of image pickup device according to the invention using a signal processing method also according to the invention, an ordinary image pickup mode is automatically switched to a dynamic range broadening image pickup mode or vice versa in the embodiment depending on the difference between bright areas and dark areas of the object being shot. Then, in the wide dynamic range image pickup mode, the obtained image of the object shows a sufficient degree of contract between dark areas and bright areas of the object. Additionally, any abrupt changes in the image can be avoided at the time of switching from an ordinary image pickup mode to a dynamic range broadening image pickup mode or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
