<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device using a low dielectric constant film and a silicon-based composition used for the same, a low dielectric constant film, and a method for producing the low dielectric constant film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Arts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is important for integration and miniaturization of a semiconductor to reduce the parasitic capacitance that is generated between wirings in multilayer wiring processes of a semiconductor integrated circuit and to reduce the delay of the signal propagation speed (i.e., the wiring delay). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although the reduction of the signal propagation speed by the parasitic capacitance of an insulating film has been recognized so far, the influence of the wiring delay on the entire device has not been so remarkable in the semiconductor devices of generations in which the wiring gap is larger than 1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the case the wiring gap is 1 &mgr;m or less, however, the influence on the device speed becomes large. In particular, when a circuit is formed with the wiring gap being 0.5 &mgr;m or less as will be expected in near future, the parasitic capacitance between wirings will be affecting the device speed more. Accordingly this will be a big obstacle for the integration and miniaturization of a semiconductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In other words, while the reduction of the signal propagation speed depends largely on the wiring resistance and parasitic capacitance between wirings in the multilayer wiring of a semiconductor integrated circuit, higher integration of a device makes the width of a wiring and wiring gap narrower, resulting in increase in the wiring resistance and parasitic capacitance between wirings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The capacitance of an insulating film can be reduced by making the wiring thickness thinner to reduce the cross-sectional area. However, making the wiring thinner results in larger wiring resistance, and therefore, a higher signal propagation speed cannot be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is indispensable for achieving a higher signal propagation speed to make the resistance of a wiring and the dielectric constant of an insulating film lower, and it is expected that they will play very important roles in deciding properties of a device in future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Wiring delay (T) is affected by wiring resistance (R) and capacitance (C) between wirings as shown in Eq. 1.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>T&prop;CR</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In eq. 1, the relation between e (dielectric constant) and C is expressed by Eq. 1&prime;.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>C&equals;&isin;</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&isin;<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&middot;S/d</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1&prime;)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> wherein S is an electrode area; co is a dielectric constant of the vacuum; &isin;<highlight><subscript>r </subscript></highlight>is a relative dielectric constant of an insulating film; and d is a wiring gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the wiring delay is effectively diminished by making the dielectric constant of the insulating film lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Inorganic films such as silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), silicon nitride (SiN), and phosphate silicate glass (PSG) and organic polymers such as polyimide have been used as insulating materials so far. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> However, the dielectric constant of CVD-SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>films, which are most frequently used for semiconductor devices, is about 4 or so. Although the dielectric constant of an SiOF film, which is now being calling attentions as a low dielectric constant CVD film, is about 3.3-3.5, it is hygroscopic, so that it has a problem in that the dielectric constant is increased by absorbing water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In addition, as a low dielectric constant film, a porous film made of a siloxane resin having SiH bonds is known. However, when a semiconductor device is subjected to washing with an alkaline solution, there is a problem in that highly hygroscopic SiOH groups are formed as a result of hydrolysis, resulting in an increased dielectric constant, together with the problem of mechanical damages on the semiconductor part such as cracks caused by the washing. To solve these problems, a protecting film such as a SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film has been formed conventionally. However, this will make relatively smaller the rate of the low dielectric constant film in a semiconductor device, and accordingly, the effective dielectric constant will be increased when multilayer wirings are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> To compare, organic polymer films can be used to have a lower dielectric constant. However, the glass transition temperatures are as low as 200-350&deg; C. and the coefficients of thermal expansion are large, so that the damages to the wiring are problematic. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, the object of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned several problems in order to form an excellent film, as well as to provide an insulating film having a lower dielectric constant than those of conventional insulating films, and to provide fast and reliable semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention improves, in many cases, chemical resistance, especially against alkali solutions of a silica-based film, and it can solve the problem of highly hygroscopic characteristic presented in conventional porous films made of a siloxane resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition comprising a siloxane resin, a silicon compound substantially consisting of silicon, carbon and hydrogen, wherein the number ratio of carbon to silicon atoms forming an &mdash;X&mdash; bond (wherein X is (C)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(where m is an integer in the range of from 1 to 3), or a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group with carbon atoms of not more than 9) in the main chain of one molecule is from 2:1 to 12:1, as well as a solvent. Hereupon, it is to be noted that &lsquo;C&rsquo; of (C)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>means a carbon atom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As other aspects of the present invention, there are provided a low dielectric constant film obtained by subjecting the composition to a heat treatment, a semiconductor device having the low dielectric constant film as an interlayer insulating film, and a method for producing the low dielectric constant film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It was found that a film obtained by adding a silicon compound having a silicon-carbon bond(s) in the skeletal chain (main chain) to a siloxane resin is given a nature of repelling chemicals such as an alkali. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It was also found that, when the compound was added to a siloxane resin, the compound was homogeneously dispersed into the siloxane resin because of its high compatibility, and that the resistance against acidic and alkaline solutions was improved and was lasting even if the compound was added to the siloxane resin at a weight ratio of 0.1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the siloxane resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It was also found that a silicon compound having a silicon-carbon bond(s) in its skeleton had a high moisture resistance, and therefore, the composition according to the present invention was effective even in forming porous films that would have a problem of low moisture resistance, unless it were used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It was also found that the combination of a siloxane resin and such a silicon compound can prevent damages (mechanical damages such as cracks) caused on a siloxane-based low dielectric constant film in an alkaline solution, which has been a problem for low dielectric constant films having a SiH bond(s), and that the increase in the dielectric constant caused by the hygroscopic behavior can be solved in many cases, which has been another problem for low dielectric constant porous films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Such a silicon compound can be identified as a silicon compound having an &mdash;X&mdash; bond (wherein X is (C)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(where m&equals;1 to 3) or a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group with 9 or less carbon atoms) in its main chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> By using s silicon compound having the above-mentioned &mdash;X&mdash; bond (wherein X is (C)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(where m&equals;1 to 3) or a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group with 9 or less carbons) in its main chain, together with a siloxane resin, forming a coating film containing both, and heating the resultant film, it is possible to produce a low dielectric constant film with minimized hydrolysis and/or damages by the chemical treatment, while the elevation of the dielectric constant in a process for producing a semiconductor is suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the above-mentioned silicon compound has a structure represented by formula 2 below:

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the above-mentioned siloxane resin has a structure represented by formula 3 below:

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> (wherein R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are each, same or different, hydrogen, fluorine, a methyl group or an &mdash;O&mdash; bond; and n is an integer of 5 to 1,000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is not much preferable that R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group other than hydrogen, fluoride, or a methyl group since the elimination of hydrogen is enhanced, resulting in acceleration of the formation of cross linkage. It has been found that, although the &mdash;O&mdash; bond also promotes crosslinking reactions, they do not cause practical problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The &mdash;X&mdash; bond used herein (wherein X is (C)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(where m is 1 to 3) or a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group with 9 or less carbon atoms), taking the case of m&equals;3 for example, means a state in which three carbon atoms are serially linked as C&mdash;C&mdash;C, wherein each carbon can have a substituent group(s) other than hydrogen. A simple example of the case of m&equals;3 is propylene group. The m is limited to the range of from 1 to 3 because the decrease in heat resistance may be observed when m is 4 or larger. Phenylene group is an example of the substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group with 9 or less carbon atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Tests revealed that a silicon compound substantially consisting of silicon, carbon and hydrogen, wherein the number ratio of carbon to silicon atoms forming an &mdash;X&mdash; bond (wherein X is (C)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(where m is an integer in the range of from 1 to 3), or a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group with 9 or less carbon atoms) in the main chain of one molecule is from 2:1 to 12:1, is preferable, since it gives a low dielectric constant film having a good balance of low dielectric constant, chemical resistance against acids and alkalis, and moisture resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> From the viewpoint of the production method, the above-mentioned siloxane resin is preferably a siloxane resin obtained by subjecting to a heat treatment a mixture containing a tetraalkoxysilane (a) and an alkyltrialkoxysilane and/or trialkoxysilane (b) at a molar ratio (a:b) of 0:1 to 1:0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain a siloxane resin having consistent qualities, it is preferable to produce the resin by releasing, during the above-mentioned heat treatment, from 100 to 400 moles of alcohols out of 100 moles of (a&plus;b), the total of the tetraalkoxysilane (a) and the alkyltrialkoxysilane and/or trialkoxysilane (b). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It has been also found that it is preferable that the carbon concentration in the siloxane resin is in the range of from 1 to 80 atom % per total atoms in the siloxane resin to achieve a consistent low dielectric constant. It is conjectured that hydrolysis is suppressed upon formation of the low dielectric constant film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It has been also found that it is similarly preferable that the concentration of hydrogen atoms directly bonded to silicon in the siloxane resin is in the range of from 1 to 25 atom % per total atoms in the siloxane resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A case in which both conditions are satisfied is also one of the preferable embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the weight ratio of the above-mentioned silicon compound to the above-mentioned siloxane resin is in the range of from 0.001 to 2, that is, 0.1 to 200 parts by weight of the former based on 100 part by weight of the latter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the composition according to the present invention also contains a substance selected from the group consisting of a novolak resin, an epoxy resin, an acrylic resin, a polyester, polypropylene, a phenol compound, an imidazole compound, and an adamantane compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It has been found that an acrylic resin is especially preferable among the above-mentioned substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> There are various kinds of acrylic resins with respect to the degree of polymerization, the level of copolymerization, and so on. An appropriate one can be selected among them by a trial and error method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> These substances are added to form pores by the vaporization and dissipation thereof while a low dielectric constant film is being formed. That is, they are dissipating agents (pore-forming substances). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Although a low dielectric constant film having a further lower dielectric constant can be produced by the formation of pores, mechanical properties such as strength are deteriorated at the same time. Therefore, it is desirable that pores having appropriate sizes are distributed in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is preferable to add from 5 to 200 parts by weight of a dissipating agent to 100 parts by weight of a siloxane resin. This is because the dielectric constant is not reduced enough when it is less than 5 parts by weight, and the strength of the film is reduced when it is more than 200 parts by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It has been also found that a substance having a thermal weight loss coefficient in a specific range is appropriate as the above-mentioned substance. Namely, a substance is desirable which loses its weight by 5% by weight or more at 150&deg; C. and loses its weight by 90% by weight or more at 400&deg; C. when it is heated up from usual temperature at a rate of 10&deg; C./min. This is probably because formation of the above-mentioned pores is appropriately controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that the porosity of the above-mentioned pores is from 10% to 70% by volume per the total volume of the low dielectric constant film. When the porosity is less than 10% by volume, its porosity-generating effect is small. When the porosity exceeds 70% by volume, mechanical properties are deteriorated. A desirable average pore size (diameter) is in the range of from 50 to 200 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned examinations have revealed that a low dielectric constant film having an SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>bond(s), a C&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash; bond(s), as well as an &mdash;X&mdash; bond(s) (wherein X is (C)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(where m is an integer in the range of from 1 to 3), or a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group with 9 or less carbon atoms), and having a porosity of from 10% to 70% by volume and a relative dielectric constant of from 1.4 to 2.5 achieves a low dielectric constant, suppresses the hydrolysis, and has good mechanical properties. A low dielectric constant film having such properties can be achieved by combining a film with a composition comprising a siloxane resin and a silicon compound having a silicon-carbon bond(s) in its skeletal chain, with pores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As a representative mechanical strength, it is desirable that the tensile strength at break is from 30 to 80 MPa as measured by the Stud Pull method. A tensile strength at break of smaller than 30 MPa is not mechanically sufficient. When it exceeds 80 MPa, it is not inconvenient from a mechanical viewpoint, but the dielectric constant will be deteriorated in many cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been achieved as a result of investigations of a system having an SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>bond(s), a C&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash; bond(s), as well as an &mdash;X&mdash; bond(s) (wherein X is (C)<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(where m is an integer in the range of from 1 to 3), or a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group with 9 or less carbon atoms). However, when the achieved results are observed only from the viewpoint of physical properties, it can be considered that a low dielectric constant film having a porosity of from 10% to 70% by volume, a relative dielectric constant of from 1.4 to 2.5, and a tensile strength at break of from 30 to 80 MPa as measure by the Stud Pull method, and consisting substantially of silicon, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, provides the above-mentioned various effects.</paragraph>
