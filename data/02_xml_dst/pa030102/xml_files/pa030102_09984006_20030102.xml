<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to improved methods of detecting an early stage of renal disease and/or renal complications of a disease, particularly diabetes. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The appearance of excess protein such as albumin in the urine is indicative of kidney disease. Diabetic nephropathy is such a disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The applicant has found that proteins, including albumin, are normally excreted as a mixture of native protein and fragments that are specifically produced during renal passage Osicka T. M. et al., <highlight><italic>Nephrology, </italic></highlight>2:199-212 (1996)). Proteins are heavily degraded during renal passage by post-glomerular (basement membrane) cells that may include tubular cells. Lysosomes in renal tubular cells may be responsible for the breakdown of proteins excreted during renal passage. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates the progress of filtered intact albumin into tubular cells and breakdown of albumin to provide excreted albumin fragments. The breakdown products are excreted into the tubular lumen. In normal individuals, most of the albumin in the urine is fragmented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When lysosome activity or intracellular processes directing substrates to lysosomes is reduced, more of the high molecular weight, and substantially full length albumin appears in the urine. This reflects an imbalance in the cellular processes in the kidney tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The applicant has discovered that when proteins, including major plasma proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulin, are filtered by the kidney, they are subsequently degraded by cells in the kidney prior to the material being excreted (see, PCT published application WO 00/37944). It is likely that filtered proteins are taken up by tubular cells. Tubular cells lie beyond the kidney filter and come in direct contact with the primary filtrate. When proteins are internalized by the tubular cells, they are directed towards the lysosomes, where they are partially degraded to various size fragments, and then regurgitated to outside the cell. These regurgitated fragments, of which there may be at least 60 different fragments generated from any one particular type of protein, are then excreted into the urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The applicant has discovered that in renal disease fragmentation of proteins is inhibited. This means that substantially full-length filtered proteins are excreted in a person suffering from renal disease. This transition from fragmentation to inhibition of fragmentation of excreted proteins is a basis for the development of new drugs and diagnostic assays. For example, initial changes that occur with the onset of renal complications in diabetes are associated with a change in the fragmentation profile of excreted albumin. This leads to an apparent microalbuminuria that is synonymous with the development of diabetic nephropathy. It is likely that this is due to an inhibition in the lysosomal activity of tubular cells in diabetes. Thus, drugs can be formulated to turn on lysosomal activity in diabetes where renal complications are occurring. The drugs may also be useful in other renal diseases where lysosomal activities are affected, or in diabetes without renal complications in situations where lysosomal activity is turned off in non-renal tissues. Such drugs include antiproliferative drugs, such as anti cancer drugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, by the time the excess albumin is detected, kidney disease has progressed, possibly to a stage where it is irreversible and treatment has little effect. Therefore there is a continuing need in the art to provide a test that is more sensitive than the currently known radioimmunoassay to detect such a disease as early as possible so that the disease can be either prevented or a treatment protocol commenced early on in the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, previous attempts to use urinary protein profiles for diagnostic purposes have been rather disappointing with respect to their clinical validity, in part because of the insufficient reproducibility, sensitivity, and rapidity of available techniques. Thus, there exists a continuing need for an improvement in methods for improved methods of detecting an early stage of renal disease and/or renal complications of a disease, particularly diabetes </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention provides improved methods of detecting an early stage of renal disease and/or renal complications of a disease, particularly diabetes. A fragmentation profile is determined in terms of the size, and sequence of particular fragments derived from intact filtered proteins together with the position where enzyme scission occurs along the protein polypeptide chain. The fragmentation profile is characteristic of the diseased state of the kidney. Accordingly, methods of detecting early signs of a disease, including kidney disease, determining a patient&apos;s propensity for the disease, preventing the onset of the disease, and treating the disease at the earliest stage possible are some of the objects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The method involves taking urine from a subject, and separating all the fragments. In a particular embodiment, the separation is by HPLC (single dimensional or two dimensional or three dimensional electrophoresis and/or chromatography), then sizing the fragments by mass spectrometry and using amino acid sequencing to determine the peptide sequence and where enzyme scission occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Although not limited to any particular disease, according to the method of the invention, the disease sought to be diagnosed includes nephropathy, diabetes insipidus, diabetes type I, diabetes II, renal disease (glomerulonephritis, bacterial and viral glomerulonephritides, IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein Purpura, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, Sj&ouml;gren&apos;s syndrome, nephrotic syndrome (minimal change disease, focal glomerulosclerosis and related disorders), acute renal failure, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, GU tract inflammatory disease, Pre-clampsia, renal graft rejection, leprosy, reflux nephropathy, nephrolithiasis), genetic renal disease (medullary cystic, medullar sponge, polycystic kidney disease (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, tuborous sclerosis), von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial thin-glomerular basement membrane disease, collagen III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy, Alport&apos;s syndrome, Fabry&apos;s disease, Nail-Patella Syndrome, congenital urologic anomalies), monoclonal gammopathies (multiple myeloma, amyloidosis and related disorders), febrile illness (familial Mediterranean fever, HIV infection&mdash;AIDS), inflammatory disease (systemic vasculitides (polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener&apos;s granulomatosis, polyarteritis, necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis), polymyositis-dermatomyositis, pancreatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, gout), blood disorders (sickle cell disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, acute cortical necrosis, renal thromboembolism), trauma and surgery (extensive injury, burns, abdominal and vascular surgery, induction of anesthesia), drugs (penicillamine, steroids) and drug abuse, malignant disease (epithelial (lung, breast), adenocarcinoma (renal), melanoma, lymphoreticular, multiple myeloma), circulatory disease (myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), skin disease (psoriasis, systemic sclerosis), respiratory disease (COPD, obstructive sleep apnoea, hypoia at high altitude) and endocrine disease (acromegaly, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus). Specific proteinuria, and in particular, albuminuria (micro- and macro-), is a marker of these disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment, the invention provides improved methods of detecting non-renal diseases. With the recognition that filtered proteins are degraded during renal passage, the methods described in this application can also detect protein fragments derived from proteins generated by non-renal disease. Non-renal diseases, such as cancers, generate increased levels of proteins into the circulation. The urinary analysis of these filtered proteins would currently not detect the intact form of these proteins. Therefore a method as described below to detect and analyze fragments resulting from degradation during renal passage that will be able to detect the seriousness of the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Both embodiments can use non-antibody technology, by separating a desired protein and its fragments from urine samples in a three-dimensional fashion; isolating the fragments; and determining the sequence of the protein and its fragments. This assay is repeated over a period of time. A change in the fragmentation profile over time indicates early stage of a particular disease. A change in the size of the fragments, as determined by sequence analysis, can indicate which type of renal disease the subject has a propensity to develop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the invention will be more fully understood from the following description of the invention, the referenced drawings attached hereto and the claims appended hereto.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The applicant has discovered that when proteins, including major plasma proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulin, are filtered by the kidney they are subsequently degraded by cells in the kidney prior to the material being excreted.

These regurgitated fragments, of which there may be at least 60 different fragments generated from any one particular type of protein, are then excreted into the urine. </paragraph>

This means that substantially full-length filtered proteins will be excreted in a person suffering from renal disease. This transition from fragmentation to inhibition of fragmentation of excreted proteins is a basis for the development of new drugs and diagnostic assays. For example, initial changes that occur with the onset of renal complications in diabetes are associated with a change in the fragmentation profile of excreted albumin. This leads to an apparent microalbuminuria, which is synonymous with the development of diabetic nephropathy. It is likely that this is due to an inhibition in the lysosomal activity of tubular cells in diabetes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Thus, drugs can be formulated to turn on lysosomal activity in diabetes where renal complications are occurring. The drugs may also be useful in other renal diseases where lysosomal activities are affected, or in diabetes without renal complications in situations where lysosomal activity is turned off in non-renal tissues. Such drugs include antiproliferative drugs, such as anti cancer drugs or antibodies to neutralize TGF-beta. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The applicant has discovered a unique assay for detecting protein fragment arrays of specific proteins, which are detected in the urine of subjects. Detection of the protein fragment array and changes to the protein fragment array are predictive of a predisposition to renal disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The principle of the protein fragment array is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. The intact protein is represented by a series of regions representing specific amino acid sequences within the protein. All proteins have these specific primary structures. When such a protein from plasma, like albumin or immunoglobulin is filtered it is filtered intact. However, after the protein is filtered it may be taken up by renal cells, such as early proximal tubular cells, and be degraded, by enzymes within lysosomes, to many fragments (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). These fragments are excreted in urine. For normal functioning kidneys, the fragmentation process is maximal with small fragments derived from many individual filtered proteins being produced and ultimately excreted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> illustrates a fragmentation profile from the trypsin digest of albumin. A similar profile is seen in the urine of a control, normal volunteer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). In terms of the number of fragments produced from each protein and the nature of the peptide splitting (i.e., the position along the protein where scission occurs), the fragmentation profile is specific. The size and sequence characteristic of the individual fragments will be characteristic of the specificity and activity of lysosomal enzymes acting on the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Proteases such as V-8, trypsin and Lys-C can be used to produce a peptide map of a purified protein. Other proteases can be used, preferably proteases that cause limited proteolysis (&ldquo;enzyme scission&rdquo;), in which a protease cleaves only one or a limited number of peptide bonds of a target protein. The protease can be from any group of proteases, such as the serine proteinases (chymotrypsin, trypsin, elastase, kallikrein, and the substilisin family), the cysteine proteinases (the plant proteases such as papain, actinidin or bromelain, some cathepsins, the cytosolic calpains, and parasitic proteases (e.g., from Trypanosoma, Schistosoma), the aspartic proteinases (pepsin family members such as pepsin, chymosin, some cathepsins D, and renin; certain fungal proteases (penicillopepsin, rhizopuspepsin, endothiapepsin); and viral proteinases such as retropepsin); and the metalloproteinases (including thermolysin, neprilysin, alanyl aminopeptidase, and astacin). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In renal disease, the fragmentation process of filtered proteins is inhibited. The number of fragments is decreased and the size of the fragments is increased (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>). This is due to the fact that there are less points of scission by lysosmal enzymes. Therefore, in terms of the size and amino acid sequence, the fragment profile is considerably different from that obtained in normal kidneys for any particular filtered protein, such as albumin or immunoglobulin. The degree of inhibition of fragmentation will depend on the severity of the disease. As disease progresses the degree of fragmentation will become less as demonstrated in FIG A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,835 discloses a method of diagnosing renal diseases by detecting fragments of albumin in human urine. The &apos;835 patent discloses that the fragments are derived from the plasma and are filtered by the kidney, unaltered, and are ultimately excreted. The method of detection of the urinary fragments in the &apos;835 patent preferably involves the use of affinity binding to conventional albumin antibodies. In contrast to the method of present invention, there is an increased detection of albumin fragments in diabetes in the method of the &apos;835 patent. In the present invention, the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy can occur when there is a decrease in the number of fragments. The albumin fragments examined in the present invention are not necessarily detected by albumin antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the method of the &apos;835 patent, one embodiment of the invention is the taking urine from a patient, and separating all the fragments by HPLC (single dimensional or two dimensional or three dimensional electrophoresis and/or chromatography) and then sizing the fragments by mass spectrometry and then using amino acid sequencing to determine the peptide sequence and where peptide scission occurred. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Methods of Detection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Urinary protein profiles can be created and examined using the methods of Hampel D J et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. </italic></highlight>12(5): 1026-35 (2001), who have developed a sensitive, high-throughput technique, namely surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) ProteinChip&reg; array-time of flight mass spectrometry. Hampel et al. tested the applicability of the technique for protein profiling of urine and to exemplify its use for patients receiving radiocontrast medium. Assessment of the accuracy, sensitivity, and reproducibility of SELDI in test urinary protein profiling was performed in rats before and after intravenous administration of either ioxilan or hypertonic saline solution as a control. Administration of ioxilan to rats resulted in changes in the abundance of proteins of varying weights. Then, urine samples from patients undergoing cardiac catheterization were obtained. For patients, even in uncomplicated cases of radiocontrast medium infusion during cardiac catheterization, perturbations in the protein composition occurred but returned to baseline values after 6 to 12 hours. Proteins with certain defined molecular masses changed in abundance. For patients with impaired renal function, these changes were not reversible within 6 to 12 hours. As a proof of principle, one of the proteins was identified as &bgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-microglobulin. Even for patients without renal complications, proteins with a broad range of molecular masses either appear in or disappear from the urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Urinary protein profiles can also be created and examined using the commercially available ProteinChip&reg; System (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, Calif., USA), which uses SELDI (Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization) technology to rapidly perform the separation, detection and analysis of proteins at the femtomole level directly from biological samples. Each aluminum chip contains eight individual, chemically treated spots for sample application; this set-up facilitates simultaneous analysis of multiple samples. A colored, hydrophobic coating retains samples on the spots and simultaneously allows for quick identification of chip type. Typically, a few microliters of sample applied on the ProteinChip&reg; Array yield sufficient protein for analysis with the ProteinChip&reg; Reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> For more dilute samples, a ProteinChip&reg; Bioprocessor can be used to apply up to 500 &mgr;l. The mass determination of protein samples is accomplished by sample crystallization, sample ionization, flight through a vacuum tube, and detection of the ionized proteins. After washing off non-specifically bound proteins and other contaminants from the ProteinChip&reg; Array, a chemical Energy Absorbing Molecule (EAM) solution is applied and allowed to dry, during which time minute crystals form on the chip. These crystals contain the EAM and the protein(s) of interest. After inserting the ProteinChip Array into the ProteinChip Reader, a laser beam is focused upon the sample, which causes the proteins embedded in the EAM crystals to desorb and ionize. Released ions then experience an accelerating electrical field that causes them to &ldquo;fly&rdquo; through a vacuum tube, towards the ion detector. Finally, the ionized proteins are detected and an accurate mass is determined based on the time of flight (TOF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Proteases such as V-8, trypsin and Lys-C can be used to produce a peptide map of a purified protein bound to the ProteinChip&reg; Array by on-chip protease digestion as shown in the figure to the right. The molecular weights of the resulting fragments can be compared to a peptide database for identification. The process takes less than an hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Additionally, twelve ProteinChip Arrays aligned side-by-side create a 96-well plate footprint. A typical experiment using ProteinChip Array technology requires one to three hours of work at the bench followed by automated sample analysis with the ProteinChip Reader. The entire process thus can be completed in a single afternoon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Other Methods </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the diseases to be treated include, but are not limited to renal disease (glomerulonephritis, bacterial and viral glomerulonephritides, IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein Purpura, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, Sj&ouml;gren&apos;s syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome (minimal change disease, focal glomerulosclerosis, and related disorders), acute renal failure, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, GU tract inflammatory disease, Pre-clampsia, renal graft rejection, leprosy, reflux nephropathy, nephrolithiasis), genetic renal disease (medullary cystic, medullar sponge, polycystic kidney disease (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, tuborous sclerosis), von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial thin-glomerular basement membrane disease, collagen III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy, Alport&apos;s syndrome, Fabry&apos;s disease, Nail-Patella Syndrome, congenital urologic anomalies). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for determining a propensity for or early diagnosis of renal disease and/or renal complications of a disease. The method includes determining a change in the albumin content in a urine sample. The disease may be a kidney disease, although not necessarily limited to a kidney disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the method of the invention, albumin is used herein only as an example of a protein to be detected in urine. When the albumin in a patient is analyzed by conventional RIA, it is expected that a normoalbuminuric patient or normal individual would have albumin in the urine in the range of 3-10 &mgr;g/min in young people and greater in older people. However, normoalbuminuric patients also show levels of albumin in the urine if measured by HPLC. Applicant has found that these levels may be in the order of 5 &mgr;g/min. As kidney disease progresses, the level of intact/modified albumin will increase to microalbuminuria levels in the order of 20 to 200 &mgr;g/min as determined by RIA. This will be much higher when determined by HPLC or a method that determines the sum of intact albumin and intact modified albumin. By monitoring the increase in intact/modified albumin, early signs of kidney disease may be detected. However, these levels are not detectable by the methods currently available such as radioimmunoassay using antibodies currently commercially in use, possibly for the reason that antibodies detect certain epitopes. If the albumin is modified in any way as described above, the epitope may be destroyed thereby leaving the modified albumin undetectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A patient suspected of having diabetic kidney disease will not show signs of kidney degeneration until well after 10 to 15 years when albumin is detected by currently available methods such as RIA methods. Urinary excretion rates of at least 20 &mgr;g/min may be detected by RIA when an individual enters a microalbuminuric state. Again, by observing the excretion of modified albumin, a change in the kidney and possibly onset of a kidney disease may be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A normoalbuminuric subject, or normoalbuminuric diabetic patient may continue to have a low albumin excretion rate of less than 20 &mgr;g/min as determined by RIA, for many years. The presence of albumin in the urine is a sign that functions of the kidney may be impaired. Once this level begins to change, treatment may be initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In a normal individual a small amount of albumin is detectable in the urine. Total filtered albumin appears mainly as fragmented albumin in urine. Some albumin may be detected in normoalbuminuric individuals. However, the excretion rate of albumin in urine in a normoalbuminuric individual may be as low as 5 &mgr;g/min. This level is generally detectable by RIA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The modified protein of the invention can be detected by a variety of methods that are well-known in the art, including, but not limited to chromatography, electrophoresis and sedimentation, or a combination of these, which are described in Karger B L, Hancock W S (eds.) <highlight><italic>High Resolution Separation and Analysis of biological Macromolecules.

Chemistry, Cambridge, UK, which references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The electrophoresis method includes, but is not limited to, moving-boundary electrophoresis, zone electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The chromatography method includes, but is not limited to, partition chromatography, adsorption chromatography, paper chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography, gel chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Preferably, the method is a sizing gel chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. More preferably, the method is hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a HPLC column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The modified protein can also be detected by the use of specific albumin dyes. Such methods are described by Pegoraro et al., <highlight><italic>American Journal of Kidney Diseases </italic></highlight>35(4): 739-744 (April 2000), the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The modified albumin, as well as the whole albumin, is detectable by this dye method to provide the sum of modified albumin and whole or intact albumin. This detection method may be used with or without an initial separation of the albumin components from urine. Such dyes normally do not detect fragments &lt;10,000 in molecular weight, but will detect the modified albumin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In this dye method of detection, a dye such as Albumin Blue 580 is used. Such dyes are naturally non-fluorescent, but fluoresce on binding to intact albumin as well as the modified albumin, but do not bind to globulins. Therefore, globulins do not interfere with the assay so that measurements can be made in unfractionated urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Applicant has found that among diabetics, a normoalbuminuric diabetic patient has almost undetectable levels of modified or fragments of albumin when analyzed by conventional RIA. They appear to be normal. However, when the urine is tested by HPLC, the levels of modified albumin are much greater than found in a normal individual. This difference in albumin may be attributed to the inability of conventional RIA&apos;s to adequately detect all albumin (total albumin) in intact or modified forms. Thus, HPLC is preferred for generating a fragmentation profile. A fragmentation profile on HPLC is characterized by a series of peaks representing a number of species of albumin as fragments or in intact or modified forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In a preferred aspect of the present invention, the method of determining a propensity for or early diagnosis of a kidney disease in a subject is determined before the subject becomes microalbuminuric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Measuring albumin content in a sample by an HPLC method of the present invention may provide different results from its measurement by conventional RIA. In the HPLC technique, a low level of albumin is observed in normal individuals. When the level of modified albumin begins to be detected and its level increases, and progresses toward microalbuminuria then a patient can be determined to have a propensity for kidney disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In a normal individual, the HPLC generated fragmentation profile is characterized by the absence of a peak in a region where fall-length native albumin elutes. Instead, multiple fragmented albumin is detectable. A pure protein product (unmodified) produces essentially a single peak. For example, using a hydrophobicity HPLC, albumin was observed to elute in the range of 39-44 minutes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Thus, a normal individual would provide a distinct fragmentation profile indicative of an absence of kidney disease or no propensity for a kidney disease. However, as kidney disease progresses, an increasing amount of modified albumin first, and then native form later are detectable. The fragmentation profile begins to change and more products in the region of full-length albumin manifests as additional spikes or an enlarged peak indicative of more intact/modified albumin in the urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In a HPLC generated fragmentation profile of a urine sample, the modified albumin may appear in a region where native albumin elutes but may be manifest as multiple peaks indicating the presence of multiple forms of modified albumin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment, the propensity for kidney disease may be measured by determining the presence of or identifying at least one species of modified albumin. This may be determined or identified by the presence of a specific peak on a HPLC profile, preferably the peak is within the range of position that corresponds to the elution position of the native albumin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The method for determining the propensity for kidney disease is applicable to any individual. Kidney disease may be caused by a number of factors including bacterial infection, allergic, congenital defects, stones, tumors, chemicals or from diabetes. Preferably, the method is applicable for determining a propensity for kidney disease in diabetic patients that may progress to a kidney disease. Preferably, the individual is a normoalbuminuric diabetic. However, normal individuals may be monitored for propensity for the disease by determining increased levels of intact or modified albumin in the urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The method of the invention can be carried out using non-antibody separation procedures as described above. However, antibody specific for modified protein may also be used to detect the presence of the modified protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The antibody to the modified protein may be obtained using the following method. The procedure is described specifically for albumin by way of example only, and can be readily applied to antibody production against any other protein in the urine. The method seeks to determine which modified albumin molecule is the most sensitive marker to identify diabetic patients, for example, who will progress to kidney complications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The modified albumin is characterized by carrying out a quantitative separation of the modified albumin molecules, such as by preparative HPLC. The modified proteins are analyzed for ligand binding, such as glycation. Subsequently, amino acid sequence of the individual modified protein is determined, preferably by mass spectrometry using methods described in Karger B L, Hancock W S (eds.) <highlight><italic>High Resolution Separation and Analysis of biological Macromolecules. Part A Fundamentals in Methods in Enzymology, </italic></highlight>Vol. 270, 1996, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., USA; or Karger B L, Hancock W S (eds.) <highlight><italic>High Resolution Separation and Analysis of biological Macromolecules. Part B Applications in Methods in Enzymology, </italic></highlight>Vol. 271, 1996, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., USA, for example, which references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In a preferred embodiment, there may be about 3 to 4 modified albumin species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The method of generating antibody against the modified albumin seeks to develop a diagnostic immunoassay for the modified albumin that predicts those diabetic patients, for example, that progress to kidney complications. To accomplish this, sufficient quantities of modified albumin is prepared by HPLC. Antibodies are made by sequential injection of the modified albumin in an animal such as a rabbit, to generate good titer, and the antibodies are isolated using conventional techniques using methods described in Goding J W, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice. <highlight><italic>Production and Application of monoclonal Antibodies in Cell Biology, Biochemistry and Immunology, </italic></highlight>2nd Edition 1986, Academic Press, London, UK; or Johnstone A, Thorpe R, <highlight><italic>Immunochemistry in Practice, </italic></highlight>3rd edition 1996, Blackwell Science Ltd, Oxford, UK, for example, which references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The obtained antibodies may be polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Preferably, at least one species of a modified albumin is isolated and identified for use in determining a propensity for kidney disease. The isolated species may be used to generate antibodies for use in immunoassays. The antibodies may be tagged with an enzymatic, radioactive, fluorescent or chemiluminescent label. The detection method may include, but is not limited to radioimmuoassay, immunoradiometric assay, fluorescent immunoassay, enzyme linked immunoassay, and protein A immunoassay. The assays may be carried out in the manner described in Goding J W, <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice. Production and Application of monoclonal Antibodies in Cell Biology, Biochemistry and Immunology. </italic></highlight>2nd Edition 1986, Academic Press, London, UK; Johnstone A, Thorpe R, <highlight><italic>Immunochemistry in Practice, </italic></highlight>3rd edition 1996, Blackwell Science Ltd, Oxford, UK; or Price C P, Newman D J (eds.) <highlight><italic>Principles and Practice of Immunoassay, </italic></highlight>2nd Edition, 1997 Stockton Press, New York, N.Y., USA, for example, which references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide an article of matter or a kit for rapidly and accurately determining the presence or absence of modified protein such as modified albumin, in a sample quantitatively or non-quantitatively as desired. Each component of the kit(s) may be individually packaged in its own suitable container. The individual container may also be labeled in a manner, which identifies the contents. Moreover, the individually packaged components may be placed in a larger container capable of holding all desired components. Associated with the kit may be instructions, which explain how to use the kit. These instructions may be written on or attached to the kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The invention is also directed to a method of determining a treatment agent for renal disease and/or renal complications of a disease, comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (a) administering to a person an agent that is suspected of being able to treat the disease; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> (b) obtaining a urine sample from the person; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> (c) assaying for the modified form of the protein in the sample, wherein either the presence of or lack of presence of a modified form of the protein in the urine or decreasing amount of the modified form of the protein over time indicates that the agent is a treatment agent for the disease. The treatment agent may be a lysosome activating agent that may act directly or indirectly to activate lysosome, and thereby cause the lysosome to digest post-glomerular filtered proteins, which is a sign of a healthy kidney. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The process of trafficking of proteins to the lysosomes plays a role in the mechanism of albuminuria in diabetes. An intracellular molecule that is involved in trafficking is protein kinase C (PKC). It is contemplated that a drug or agent can be formulated that will activate lysosomal trafficking or inhibit PKC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lysosome-activating compound for use in reactivating lysosomes or processes that direct substrates to the lysosome or products away from the lysosome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a composition comprising a lysosome-activating compound and a carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preventing or treating kidney disease, said method including administering an effective amount of a lysosome-activating compound to a subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of screening a multiplicity of compounds to identify a compound capable of activating lysosomes or processes that direct substrates to the lysosome or products away from the lysosome, said method including the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> (a) exposing said compound to a lysosome and assaying said compound for the ability to activate a lysosome wherein said lysosome when activated has a changed activity; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (b) assaying for the ability to restore a cellular process to substantially normal levels in kidney tissue, wherein said kidney tissue has a low lysosome activity; and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> (c) assaying for the ability to restore tissue turnover to substantially normal levels in kidney tissue, wherein said kidney tissue has low lysosome activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Lysosomes may be associated with the breakdown of proteins, particularly albumin, in the kidney. In cases of microalbuminuria, substantial amounts of albumin escape lysosomal breakdown possibly due to a deactivated lysosome. Restoration of lysosomal breakdown may restore the balance in the kidney of cellular processes and tissue turnover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> A lysosome-activating compound may be a compound that acts directly or indirectly on the lysosome. By acting indirectly, the compound may act on a component, which influences the activity of the lysosome. Nevertheless, the outcome results in an activation of the lysosome, thereby providing enhanced protein breakdown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a composition comprising a lysosome-activating compound and a carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The composition may be a physiologically acceptable or pharmaceutically acceptable composition. However, it will be a composition which allows for stable storage of the lysosome activating compound. Where the composition is a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, it may be suitable for use in a method of preventing or treating kidney disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preventing or treating kidney disease, said method including administering an effective amount of a lysosome-activating compound to a subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As described above, the lysosome-activating compound may act by reactivating the lysosome so that cellular processes and tissue turnover are restored fully or in part, thereby resulting in the kidney being restored partially or fully. In any case, administering a lysosome activating compound to an animal having kidney disease may restore lysosome activity fully or in part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Methods of administering may be oral or parenteral. Oral may include administering with tablets, capsules, powders, syrups, etc. Parenteral administration may include intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal routes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The changed activity of the lysosome is preferably a change which enhances the activity of the lysosome so that albumin breakdown is improved. The ability to not only activate lysosome but also improve cellular processes and/or tissue turnover is a characteristic of the most desirable lysosome activating compound. Preferably, it is desired to use the lysosome activating compound to restore kidney function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for preventing kidney disease in a subject, said method including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> (a) measuring the amount of intact and modified intact albumin content in a urine sample; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> (b) determining a change in the amount of intact albumin in the urine that has been modified so as to be not detectable by conventional RIA methods wherein the change is indicative of a propensity for kidney disease; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> (c) treating the animal for a kidney disease when a change is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The following examples are offered by way of illustration of the present invention, and not by way of limitation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Purification of Modified Albumin for Antibody Production by Standard Techniques </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Urine from microalbuminuric patient which had an intact albumin concentration of 43.5 mg/L as determined by turbitimer (involving conventional immunochemical assay) was initially filtered through a 30 kDa membrane to separate the modified albumin from low molecular weight (&lt;30,000) protein fragments in urine. The material that was retained by the filter gave a yield of intact albumin of 27.4 mg/L as determined by turbitimer assay. This retained material was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G100. The material collected was the peak fraction that coelutes with intact albumin. This material gave a yield of 15.2 ml/L of albumin as determined by the turbitimer method. This material was then subjected to affinity chromatography on an intact albumin antibody column. This column will only bind albumin that has conventional epitopes. The yield of material that eluted from the column was &lt;6 mg/L (lowest sensitivity of the turbitimer). This is expected as the immunoreactive albumin would have bound to the affinity column. The eluate was then subject to reverse phase HPLC chromatography(as described above) to determine the amount of immuno-unreactive albumin in the sample. A 1452 unit area corresponding to 30.91 mg/L of purified modified albumin was noted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This purified modified albumin can then be used for antibody production by standard means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a HPLC profile of albumin alone. Essentially a single peak which elutes at approximately 39-44 minutes retention time was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a HPLC profile of plasma showing a distinct albumin peak at approximately 39-44 minutes as well as other peaks corresponding to other plasma proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a HPLC profile of a normal, healthy volunteer showing no albumin peak in the urine sample. This individual breaks down the albumin excreted into the urine possibly via an active lysosome. Substantial fragmented products were evident showing prominence of some species, particularly of a species at approximately less than 14.5 minutes retention time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> When urine from a normoalbuminuric diabetic patient (with an albumin excretion rate of 8.07 &mgr;g/min, as measured by RIA) is analyzed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), small amounts of modified albumin eluting at approximately 39-44 minutes retention time is evident. Whereas conventional test indicates the presence of &lt;6 mg/l of albumin in the urine sample, the method of the invention showed that the true albumin content in the urine sample was 26.7 mg/l. Treatment for the disease should have begun on this individual. Albumin by-products or fragmented albumin is present as in the normal, healthy volunteer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Another urine sample from normoalbuminuric diabetic patient (with albumin excretion rate of 17.04 &mgr;g/min) was analyzed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). RIA tests show albumin excreted in the urine for this patient. However, on HPLC (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) an albumin or modified albumin peak is evident at approximately 39-44 minutes retention time. Whereas conventional test indicates the presence of &lt;6 mg/l of albumin in the urine sample, the method of the invention showed that the true albumin content in the urine sample was 81.3 mg/l. Treatment for the disease should have begun on this individual. This peak begins to show a multiple peaked appearance. A smaller peak corresponding to intact albumin shows that modified albumin may represent the peak at 39-44 minutes. The presence of this albumin peak compared with the profile of a normal, healthy volunteer having no albumin peak shows a change in the detectable levels of the amount of intact/modified albumin. This may signal a propensity for a kidney disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> A further urine sample from a normoalbuminuric diabetic patient (with an albumin excretion rate of 4.37 &mgr;g/min) was analyzed, and the HPLC profile is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Again, modified albumin was detected at approximately 39-44 minutes retention time showing multiple peaks. This patient again did register normal albumin by RIA. Whereas conventional test indicates the presence of &lt;6 mg/l of albumin in the urine sample, the method of the invention showed that the true albumin content in the urine sample was 491 mg/l. Treatment for the disease should have begun on this individual. It is clear that modified albumin assessment is necessary to identify these changes. This patient would be determined to have a propensity for kidney disease. As kidney disease progresses, the modified albumin peak will continue to increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> where a urine sample of a macroalbuminuric patient was analyzed. A quite significant albumin peak at approximately 39-44 minutes retention time showing multiple peaks was evident. The patient&apos;s albumin content was 1796 mg/l. Treatment for this individual is in progress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The method of the invention results in early detection of a propensity for a renal disease as illustrated by the longitudinal studies in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> show situations in which the ACE inhibitor treatment for diabetes was begun later than it should have had the modified albumin detection method of the invention been used. Detecting modified protein using the method according to the invention is a more effective method for predicting the onset of a renal disease than using conventional RIA. </paragraph>
