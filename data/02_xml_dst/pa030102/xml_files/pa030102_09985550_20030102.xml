<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, the known mobile communication apparatus includes: a portable phone body, and a rod shaped antenna, the latter projecting from the top of the portable phone body.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in detail referring to the attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the chip antenna according to the present invention includes: a base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and a ground terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is made of a dielectric material or a magnetic material, and is parallelepiped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is formed around the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes: a plurality of side electrodes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> laterally formed on both side faces of the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>; and a plurality of upper and lower electrodes <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> so as to form a helical coil around the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Further, each of the upper and lower electrodes has a substantially rectangularly bent portion <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The ground terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which is connected to the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a certain size formed on the surface of the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, so that a part of the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be connected to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Now the present invention will be described as to its action and effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is made of a dielectric or magnetic material, and is parallelepiped. The plurality of the side electrodes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the plurality of the upper and lower electrodes <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the plurality of the bent portions <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>a form the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is formed by carrying out a screen-printing or a dipping process so as to form it on the surface of the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Thus the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> helically surrounds the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, owing to the bent portions <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the total length of the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> including the side electrodes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the upper and lower electrodes <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is extended actually by about 36% compared the conventional one in which the bent portions are missing. As a result, the length of the antenna can be miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Further, the ground terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which is formed on the surface of the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and which is connected to one end of the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can serve as a part of the antenna if it is grounded to a grounding part (not illustrated) of a circuit board or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The ground terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which is formed on the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be easily adjusted as to its area, and therefore, the impedance matching of the antenna can also be easily adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of the chip antenna according to the present invention. Here, the base block is formed by stacking a plurality of dielectric or magnetic material sheets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In the mentioned sheets, a plurality of via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed, and a conductive film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is coated on the inside of each of the via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is disposed within the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which consists of a plurality of the stacked sheets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed vertically within the stacked sheets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and the bent portions <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are directed rectangularly to the via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus the internal electrodes <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are connected through the via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the bent portions <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, thereby forming a helical coiling within the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The ground terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which is connected to the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a certain size formed on the surface of the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, so that a part of the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be connected to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Thus the plurality of the sheets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are stacked to form the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Under this condition, a plurality of the via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are formed within the stacked sheets, and a conductive film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on the inside of each of the via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Further, the bent portions <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> connect the internal electrodes <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a helical coiling within the base block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The internal electrodes <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> which are connected through the via holes <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are completely connected through the rectangularly bent portions <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which are bent substantially by 90 degrees. Therefore, the total length of the conductor pattern is increased by about 36% compared with the conventional conductor pattern. Accordingly, the length of the chip antenna can be miniaturized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Further, the ground terminal <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which is connected to the conductor pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be arbitrarily adjusted as to its area. Therefore, the impedance matching can be easily adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention as described above, the total length of the conductor pattern can be extended within the fixed volume of the antenna even without the reduction of the bandwidth. Consequently, the antenna can be miniaturized, and the wave reception area is increased with the minimum volume, thereby improving the sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the above, the present invention was described based on the specific preferred embodiments and the attached drawings, but it should be apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be added without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, which will be defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
