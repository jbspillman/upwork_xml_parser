<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based on Application No. 2001-141665, filed in Japan on May 11, 2001, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system to support sales at the time when a purchaser buys goods, by providing information on stores dealing in those goods, in particular, a sales supporting system associated with a navigation system and a method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, as a result of enhancement in communication system such as the Internet or i-mode of mobile phones, data communication has become common for wide and general use. As a result, such a conduct has become a broad custom that stores disclose information such as kinds of goods the stores are dealing in and prices for respective goods to users of the stores using data communication so that the user can select stores based on the information that the stores disclosed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, when a purchaser selects a store, he/she selects in consideration of availability of goods and their prices, and in addition thereto, in many cases, selects stores to purchase goods in consideration of troubles for a visit to stores, costs (for example, train fares), etc. In addition, in the case where there is a destination having been set for another purpose, it often occurs that, by standing by at stores on the way to the above-described destination, troubles for a visit to stores and costs (for example train fares, etc.) are limited to a smaller amount. In this case, the purchaser selects the store where he/she purchases goods in consideration of troubles for he/she to stop by at the store, extra costs (for example train fares), etc., that will become necessary in case of stopping-by at the store. An example of a process when a purchaser selects stores where he/she is considering stopping-by on his/her way to a destination having been set for another purpose will be described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In Step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the purchaser looks into a position of a store that deals in desired goods and prices for the goods with a communication system such as the Internet or an i-mode in mobile phones, etc., or information magazines being generally on the market in towns. In Step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a difference in the time required on a route to head for a destination via the store as well as a difference in costs for movement is estimated. In Step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, in consideration of the price for the goods investigated in Step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the difference in the time required or the costs having been estimated in Step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, decision making on whether or not to purchase the goods is executed. In the case where decision making for a purchase is executed in Step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, he/she visits the store to purchase the goods in Step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, in the case where decision making not to purchase is executed in Step <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, decision making on whether or not investigation on stores should be continued in Step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and if the investigation on the stores should be continued, he/she returns to the process of Step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if there is no intention to investigate on stores, purchase of goods is given up and the step comes to an end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It will be troublesome or trouble a purchaser much for the purchaser to decide on a store to purchase goods through a process as described above. For example, in the procedure of Step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the purchaser looks into the position of the store that deals in the desired goods and the prices for the goods with the communication system such as the Internet or the i-mode in mobile phones, etc., or information magazines being generally on the market, but in order to select out necessary information from a variety of pieces of information on a number of stores, searching needs to be repeated a certain number of times and incurs troubles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the procedure of Step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a difference in the time required on the route to head for the destination via the store as well as a difference in costs for movement is estimated, but in order for the purchaser to execute estimation directly, it is necessary for the purchaser to be familiar with maps and information on transportation systems to a certain extent, and in the case where the purchaser is not an expert on maps and information on transportation systems, it is difficult to execute the above-described estimation. There is also a method of executing estimation with information publicized in road maps and time tables, but it requires extreme troubles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as a means for obtaining information for estimation, there is a method of using a navigation system and the like that has recently been put into practical use. The navigation system is a system to calculate and guide a route or a time required from a certain spot to another spot as well as costs for movement, etc., and for example a car navigation system installed in automobiles and a system for executing route guidance with a mobile phone terminal and the like have become available for practical use. With the navigation system, a route or a time required as well as costs for movements can be calculated comparatively easily. However, in order to calculate an increment of a time required via the store and an increment of the costs required for movements, the purchaser needs to search for at least two or more routes with the navigation system, which is troublesome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It could come to a purchaser&apos;s mind on purchasing of goods while he/she is driving an automobile or walking, but in the case where the purchaser is driving an automobile or in the case where he/she is walking, it is in fact impossible to select stores subject to troublesome operations as described above, and thus the purchaser cannot select a more suitable store with information such as kinds of goods that the store is dealing in and the prices for respective goods. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The weighting setting means <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is provided inside the on-board side system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> depicted in the apparatus configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Operations will be described as follows. The weighting setting means <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>causes the purchaser to select whether he/she regards costs as important or regards time as important at the occasion the purchaser considers purchasing goods (Procedure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). If the purchaser regards costs as important, weighting W<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>toward the level of priority on costs is set larger than normal one, or weighting W<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>toward the level of priority on time is set smaller than normal one. In addition, if the purchaser regards time as important, weighting W<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>toward the level of priority on costs is set smaller than normal one, or weighting W<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>toward the level of priority on time is set larger than normal one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, a normal value of weighting W<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>toward the level of priority on costs and weighting W<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>toward the level of priority on time is set to a value with which a general purchaser feels that the costs and time are balanced. For example, with weighting W<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;1 being set toward the level of priority on costs and with wages per unit hour for an average worker being set to weighting W<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>toward the level of priority on time being given, weighting where the time and costs are balanced can be set for an average worker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The priority setting means <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is provided inside the on-board side system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in the apparatus configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Operations will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The prices of the goods in respective stores outputted from the store listing means <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and the difference between the movement cost C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>when respective stores outputted from the movement costs calculating means <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are visited and the movement cost C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in case of direct movement from the departure spot to the destination are summed to calculate a priority level judging parameter P<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>on costs. In addition, a priority level judging parameter P<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>on time is calculated from a difference between the required time T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in case of visiting respective stores outputted from the required time calculating means <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the required time T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in case of direct movement from the departure spot to the destination T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, that is, an increased time required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Next, the one given by multiplying the priority level judging parameter P<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>with the cost weighting W<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>outputted from the weighting setting means and the one given by multiplying the priority level judging parameter P<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>with the time weighting W<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>outputted from the weighting setting means are summed to give the priority level P. In addition, those with less cost priority level are given higher priority and are outputted to the store information notifying means <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The store information notifying means <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as well as the purchase intention confirming means <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is provided inside the on-board side system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in the apparatus configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Operations will be described as follows. The prices for goods on respective stores and the positions of the stores outputted from the store listing means <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are informed with voice according to the priority outputted from the priority setting means <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(Procedure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). At the time of informing of each shop, a voice inquires whether or not that store is selected and in response thereto the purchaser tells the intention of YES/NO with voice. The system judges the intention of YES/NO with speech recognition. If that store is selected, the step goes forward to Procedure <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to confirm with synthetic voice and speech recognition whether there is an intention for booking. Upon confirmation on a booking intention, existence of purchase intention is notified to the booking fare charging means <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Unless that shop is selected, store information with next priority is informed. Guidance is repeated until a purchase intention of the purchaser is confirmed or all information is presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The booking fare charging means <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes the on-board side system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the booking fare settling server <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> shown in the apparatus configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Operations will be described as follows. When the on-board side system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the booking fare charging means <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is notified by the purchase intention confirming means <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that there is a purchase intention, the booking fare settling server <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> side of the booking fare charging means <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is notified of information on the purchase shop as well as the price for a good via the mobile terminal network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The booking fare settling server <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> charges the booking fare to the purchaser upon receipt of a notice and sets a period of validity for the booking. When charging is normally completed, the booking fare charging certifying means <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the on-board system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> side of the booking fare charging means <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are notified that charging has been normally completed. In the on-board system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> side, the contents of the booking and the period of validity are notified to the purchaser with synthetic voice. In addition, to the booking fare charging certifying means <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the vehicle plate number or registration number notified by the purchase intention confirming means <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is also notified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The booking fare charging certifying means <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes a store terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a DSRC roadside communication device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the store premises and a booking fare settling server <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown in the apparatus configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Operations will be described as follows. When it is notified that the charging has been normally completed by the booking fare charging means <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the contents of the booked goods, the period of validity of the booking and the vehicle plate number or registration number are stored. Upon arrival of the system-mounted vehicle that has booked purchase to the store, the vehicle plate number or registration number is notified to the store terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> side with DSRC communications. The store terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> inquires the booking fare settling server <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of existence/non-existence of and contents of the booking corresponding to the notified vehicle plate number or registration number via the network <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The booking fare settling server <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> confirms the corresponding booking existence/non-existence or contents thereof with the storage data in response to the inquiry. If there exists the corresponding storage data, the booking contents are notified to the store terminal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the corresponding booking is deleted from the storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, without utilizing synthetic voice and speech recognition, the processing described so far may be executed by displaying on the display screen of the on-board terminal of the on-board side system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and by key inputting of the purchaser as in the above-described embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> With the construction described above, purchase of goods proceeds according to the flow shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Describing this according to Procedures <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in Procedure <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at first, a purchaser riding in a vehicle says &ldquo;I would like to replenish gasoline&rdquo; with voice to a mobile terminal (not shown in particular) of an on-board side system <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Then, in Procedure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the terminal comes to inquire via voice &ldquo;Do you prefer a closer (i.e., shorter in distance) one&quest; Or do you prefer a cheaper one&quest;&rdquo; and then the purchaser tells which to put importance, on price or time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Then, in Procedure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the terminal gets back to inquire via voice &ldquo;How about the store A&quest; XXX yen per liter of gasoline, and the time required is XXX minutes.&rdquo;, so that a store is selected by &ldquo;OK&excl;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is there any other one&quest;&rdquo;. Then, in Procedure <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the terminal gets back to confirm via voice &ldquo;May the store A be booked&quest; XXX yen per liter of gasoline, and the time required is XXX minutes. &rdquo;, so that an intention on booking is expressed by &ldquo;OK&excl;&rdquo;. Thus, in Procedure <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the purchaser visits the store by car and can purchase gasoline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> As having been described in the foregoing, according to the present invention, a purchaser can select the store to purchase according to a store list listed in advance in order of less costs necessary for obtaining goods with the system, and therefore the purchaser can easily know the store that costs less to purchase goods without executing complicated searching operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the purchaser can select the store for purchase from the store list listed in advance with the system in order of shorter time required necessary for obtaining goods, the purchaser can easily know the stores with shorter time required necessary to purchase goods without executing complicated searching operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the purchaser selects the store to purchase goods by trading off between the costs necessary for obtaining goods and the time required necessary for obtaining the goods. According to the present invention, since stores are given priority in consideration of both of the costs necessary for obtaining goods and the time required necessary for obtaining the goods, the purchaser can know the store corresponding to the desire of the purchaser at earlier convenience compared with the case where prioritization is proceeded only one of the costs necessary for obtaining goods and the time required necessary for obtaining the goods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Further, when the purchaser judges trading off of the costs necessary for obtaining goods and the time required for obtaining the goods, it depends on circumstances on which of the costs and the time required importance should be placed. For example, in case of urgency, time will become more important while costs will become more important in case of little urgency. According to the present invention, since the purchaser can set on which of the costs and the time required to put importance according to circumstances, stores corresponding to the desire of the purchaser can be known at earlier convenience as compared with the case where weighting on the costs and the time required has been fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, according to the present invention, when a store side tries to notify a purchaser of the information of the store in question as the store information with higher priority, it will do if the price is set cheap. However, even if the price at a first store is set cheap, if the purchaser incurs higher costs required for him/her to visit the first store in spite of the fact the price is set cheap, the information on a second store, which costs less than the price at the first store to which the cost required for the purchaser to visit the first store is added, is notified to the purchaser with higher priority even though the price is set higher at the second store than at the first store. Moreover, it can be considered to set a cheaper price, which is not preferable in terms of profits of stores since a cheap price less than necessity will be offered to a purchaser who is in the vicinity of the stores and incurs low costs required for visiting the stores. According to the present invention, however, cheaper prices are set to purchasers who incur higher costs required for movements to the stores, and store information of the stores is notified with higher priority so that purchaser&apos;s visits to the stores can be urged, whereas normal prices can be set to purchasers who incur lower costs required for movements to the stores, and to whom store information of the stores is notified with higher priority without setting cheaper prices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Still further, in comparison with a case where respective stores provide with store information transmitting means, the system can be constructed inexpensively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the system is constructed such that the area for transmission is limited to the vicinity of stores so as to permit the store information to be transmitted to only purchasers passing in the vicinity of the stores. Thus, the percentage of the communication lines being occupied by unnecessary information transmission can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Besides, even if either the store information transmitting means is a means for taking only a certain limited area as a transmission range or is a means for transmitting store information only at a certain limited timing, if there is an opportunity for a purchaser to receive the store information even once, listing of the store information to the purchaser can be executed and opportunities to notify the purchaser of the store information can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In addition, such events can be suppressed that the store information stored in the store information storage means will differ from actual information after a lapse of time, and wrong store information different from actuality at the time of listing is used for judging the level of priority or wrong information is notified to purchasers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Moreover, such events can be suppressed that the store information transmitted to a certain specific area is listed by the storage means also after a purchaser departs the specific area and unnecessary information is notified to the purchaser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Further, information that purchasers need will be able to be provided in a limited storage capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a purchaser can purchase goods easily and in the case where a purchaser does not come to receive booked goods, a booking fare can cover the disadvantage that incurs the store side because of keeping the goods for that purchaser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Still further, such events can be suppressed that the goods which the store side prepared after booking of the goods are left alone for a long period without a purchaser coming to receive, resulting in a loss of value of goods (in case of foods such as fast food, etc.) or the storage costs on the goods being incurred not less than necessity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
