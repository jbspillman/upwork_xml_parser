<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a thin film magnetic memory device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a thin film magnetic memory device capable of random access and including memory cells having a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An MRAM (Magnetic Random Access Memory) device has attracted attention as a memory device capable of non-volatile data storage with low power consumption. The MRAM device is a memory device capable of nonvolatile data storage using a plurality of thin film magnetic elements formed in a semiconductor integrated circuit and also capable of random access to each thin film magnetic element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In particular, recent announcement shows that the performance of the MRAM device is significantly improved by using tunnel magnetic resistive elements having a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) as memory cells. The MRAM device including memory cells having a magnetic tunnel junction is disclosed in technical documents such as &ldquo;A 10ns Read and Write Non-Volatile Memory Array Using a Magnetic Tunnel Junction and FET Switch in Each Cell&rdquo;, ISSCC Digest of Technical Papers, TA7.2, February 2000, and &ldquo;Nonvolatile RAM based on Magnetic Tunnel Junction Elements&rdquo;, ISSCC Digest of Technical Papers, TA7.3, February 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing the structure of a memory cell having a magnetic tunnel junction (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &ldquo;MTJ memory cell&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the MTJ memory cell includes a tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR having its electric resistance value varying according to the storage data level, and an access transistor ATR. The access transistor ATR is formed from a field effect transistor, and is coupled between the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR and the ground voltage VSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For the MTJ memory cell are provided a write word line WWL for instructing a data write operation, a read word line RWL for instructing a data read operation, and a bit line BL serving as a data line for transmitting an electric signal corresponding to the storage data level in the data read and write operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram illustrating the data read operation from the MTJ memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR has a magnetic layer FL having a fixed magnetic field of a fixed direction (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &ldquo;fixed magnetic layer FL&rdquo;), and a magnetic layer VL having a free magnetic field (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &ldquo;free magnetic layer VL&rdquo;). A tunnel barrier TB of an insulator film is provided between the fixed magnetic layer FL and the free magnetic layer VL. According to the storage data level, either a magnetic field of the same direction as that of the fixed magnetic layer FL or a magnetic field of the direction different from that of the fixed magnetic layer FL has been written to the free magnetic layer VL in a non-volatile manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the data read operation, the access transistor ATR is turned ON in response to activation of the read word line RWL. As a result, a sense current Is flows through a current path formed from the bit line BL, tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR, access transistor ATR and ground voltage VSS. The sense current Is is supplied as a constant current from a not-shown control circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The electric resistance value of the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR varies according to the relative relation of the magnetic field direction between the fixed magnetic layer FL and the free magnetic layer VL. More specifically, when the fixed magnetic layer FL and the free magnetic layer VL have the same magnetic field direction, the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR has a smaller electric resistance value as compared to the case where both magnetic layers have different magnetic field directions. The electric resistance values of the tunnel magnetic resistive element corresponding to the storage data &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&rdquo; are herein indicated by R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, respectively (where R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt;R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;R). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The electric resistance value of the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR thus varies according to an externally applied magnetic field. This enables data storage to be conducted based on the variation characteristics of the electric resistance value of the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR. In general, the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR that is applied to the MRAM devices has an electric resistance value in the range from about several kilo-ohms to about several tens of kilo-ohms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A voltage change in the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR due to the sense current Is varies depending on the magnetic field direction stored in the free magnetic layer VL. Therefore, by starting supply of the sense current Is with the bit line BL precharged to a high voltage, the storage data level in the MTJ memory cell can be read by monitoring a change in voltage level on the bit line BL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram illustrating the data write operation to the MTJ memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in the data write operation, the read word line RWL is inactivated, so that the access transistor ATR is turned OFF. In this state, a data write current for writing a magnetic field to the free magnetic layer VL is supplied to the write word line WWL and the bit line BL. The magnetic field direction of the free magnetic layer VL is determined by combination of the respective directions of the data write currents flowing through the write word line WWL and the bit line BL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram illustrating the relation between the respective directions of the data write current and the magnetic field in the data write operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16, a</cross-reference> magnetic field Hx of the abscissa indicates the direction of a magnetic field H(BL) produced by the data write current flowing through the bit line BL. A magnetic field Hy of the ordinate indicates the direction of a magnetic field H(WWL) produced by the data write current flowing through the write word line WWL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The magnetic field direction stored in the free magnetic layer VL is updated only when the sum of the magnetic fields H(BL) and H(WWL) reaches the region outside the asteroid characteristic line shown in the figure. In other words, the magnetic field direction stored in the free magnetic layer VL is not updated when a magnetic field corresponding to the region inside the asteroid characteristic line is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in order to update the storage data of the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR by the data write operation, a current must be applied to both the write word line WWL and bit line BL. Once stored in the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR, the magnetic field direction, i.e., the storage data, is retained therein in a non-volatile manner until another data write operation is conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The sense current Is flows through the bit line BL in the data read operation. However, the sense current Is is generally set to a value that is about one to two orders smaller than the data write current. Therefore, it is less likely that the storage data in the MTJ memory cell is erroneously rewritten by the sense current Is during the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned technical documents disclose the technology of forming an MRAM device, a random access memory, by integrating such MTJ memory cells on a semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing the MTJ memory cells arranged in a matrix in an integrated manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> highly integrated MRAM device can be realized by arranging the MTJ memory cells in a matrix on the semiconductor substrate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows the MTJ memory cells arranged in n rows by m columns (where n, m is a natural number). Herein, n write word lines WWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to WWLn, n read word lines RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to RWLn, and m bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm are provided for the n&times;m MTJ memory cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the data read operation, one of the read word lines RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to RWLn is selectively activated, so that the memory cells on the selected memory cell row (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &ldquo;selected row&rdquo;) are electrically coupled between the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm and the ground voltage VSS, respectively. As a result, the voltage on each bit line BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm changes according to the storage data level in a corresponding memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Thus, the storage data level of the selected memory cell can be read by comparing the voltage on the bit line of the selected memory cell column (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &ldquo;selected column&rdquo;) with a prescribed reference voltage using a sense amplifier or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A dummy memory cell is generally used to produce such a reference voltage. For example, a dummy resistance having an electric resistance value Rd corresponding to an intermediate value of the electric resistance values R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> can be used as a dummy memory cell for use in the data read operation from the MTJ memory cell. The electric resistance values R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> respectively correspond to the electric resistance values of the MTJ memory cell storing the data &ldquo;1 (H level)&rdquo; and &ldquo;0 (L level)&rdquo;. The reference voltage can be produced by supplying the same sense current Is as that of the MTJ memory cell to the dummy resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> However, the data read operation requires the operation of charging and discharging a data line such as bit line to which a tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR having a relatively high electric resistance value is connected, thereby possibly making it difficult to increase the speed of the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As described in the aforementioned technical documents, as a bias voltage applied to both ends of the magnetic tunnel junction, i.e., both ends of the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR, is increased, a change in electric resistance value, &Dgr;R, is reduced that corresponds to the relative relation of the magnetization direction between the fixed magnetic layer FL and the free magnetic layer VL, i.e., that corresponds to the storage data level. Therefore, as the voltage applied to both ends of the MTJ memory cell is increased in the data read operation, the voltage on the bit line does not noticeably change corresponding to the storage data level. This may possibly hinder the speed and stability of the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Moreover, accuracy of the reference voltage is significantly affected by the electric resistance value of the dummy resistance in the dummy memory cell. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately set the reference voltage according to manufacturing variation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a thin film magnetic memory device capable of high-speed, stable data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A thin film magnetic memory device according to the present invention includes a plurality of magnetic memory cells, a first data line, a first precharging circuit, a first read driving circuit, and a first charge transfer feedback amplifier portion, and an amplifier portion. Each of the plurality of magnetic memory cells has its electric resistance value varying according to a storage data level written therein by an applied magnetic field. The first data line is electrically coupled to a first voltage through a selected one of the plurality of magnetic memory cells in data read operation. The first precharging circuit sets the first data line to a precharge voltage before the data read operation. The first read driving circuit supplies a data read current to the first data line in the data read operation. The first charge transfer feedback amplifier portion is provided between the first data line and a first internal node, for retaining a voltage on the first data line and producing a first output voltage onto the first internal node according to an integral value of the data read current flowing through the first data line. The amplifier portion produces read data based on the voltage on the first internal node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the precharge voltage is the first voltage, and the first read driving circuit couples the first data line to a second voltage in the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the first charge transfer feedback amplifier portion includes an operational amplifier for amplifying a voltage difference between first and second input nodes to produce the first output voltage onto the first internal node, a charge transfer portion coupled between the first data line and the first input node, for transmitting a voltage change on the first data line due to the data read current to the first input node, and a charge feedback portion coupled between the first internal node and the first data line, for supplying charges according to a change in the first output voltage so as to cancel the voltage change on the first data line from the first voltage. The precharge voltage is applied to the second input node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the plurality of magnetic memory cells are arranged in a matrix. The thin film magnetic memory device further includes: a plurality of word lines provided respectively corresponding to magnetic memory cell rows; a plurality of bit lines provided respectively corresponding to magnetic memory cell columns; and a column selection portion for connecting one of the plurality of bit lines that is electrically coupled to the selected magnetic memory cell to the first data line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the thin film magnetic memory device preferably further includes: a dummy memory cell having an intermediate electric resistance value of two electric resistance values of each magnetic memory cell, the two electric resistance values respectively corresponding to two storage data levels; a second data line electrically coupled to the first voltage through the dummy memory cell in the data read operation; a second precharging circuit for setting the second data line to the precharge voltage before the data read operation; a second read driving circuit for supplying a data read current to the second data line in the data read operation; and a second charge transfer feedback amplifier portion provided between the second data line and a second internal node, for retaining a voltage on the second data line and producing a second output voltage onto the second internal node according to an integral value of the data read current flowing through the second data line. The amplifier portion produces the read data according to a voltage difference between the first and second internal nodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In particular, the precharge voltage is the first voltage, and the first and second read driving circuits respectively couple the first and second data lines to a second voltage in the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the thin film magnetic memory device further includes: a dummy memory cell having an intermediate electric resistance value of two electric resistance values of each magnetic memory cell, the two electric resistance values respectively corresponding to two storage data levels; a second data line electrically coupled to the first voltage through the dummy memory cell in the data read operation; a second precharging circuit for setting the second data line to the precharge voltage before the data read operation; a second read driving circuit for supplying the data read current to the second data line in the data read operation; a second charge transfer feedback amplifier portion provided between the second data line and a second internal node, for maintaining a voltage on the second data line and producing a second output voltage onto the second internal node according to an integral value of the data read current flowing through the second data line; and a charge feedback portion coupled between the second internal node and the first data line, for feeding back with a reversed polarity a change in the second output voltage to the first data line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In particular, the precharge voltage is the first voltage, and the first and second read driving circuits respectively couple the first and second data lines to a second voltage in the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Such a thin film magnetic memory device enables suppression of a bias voltage that is applied to both ends of the selected magnetic memory cell in the data read operation. Accordingly, a change in electric resistance value in the magnetic memory cell according to the storage data level is more likely to appear, allowing for improved speed and stability of the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Moreover, providing the bit lines and the first data line in a hierarchical manner enables a plurality of magnetic memory cells arranged in a matrix to share the circuitry associated with the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the data read operation is conducted based on comparison between the dummy memory cell and the selected magnetic memory cell. Therefore, the data read operation can be accurately conducted within a margin of the timing of sensing the first output voltage from the first charge transfer feedback amplifier portion, thereby allowing for further stabilized data read operation. In particular, the voltage difference between the first and second data lines is amplified to produce the first output voltage through the charge feedback portion, thereby allowing for simplified circuit structure of the amplifier portion for producing the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A thin film magnetic memory device according to another aspect of the present invention includes a plurality of magnetic memory cells, a first data line, a dummy memory cell, a second data line, and a data read circuit. Each of the plurality of magnetic memory cells stores data written by an applied magnetic field. Each magnetic memory cell includes a magnetic storage portion having one of a first electric resistance value and a second electric resistance value that is larger than the first electric resistance value, according to a level of the storage data, and a memory cell selection gate connected in series with the magnetic storage portion, and rendered conductive when selected. The first data line is electrically coupled to the magnetic storage portion and the conductive memory cell selection gate of a selected magnetic memory cell and receives a data read current in data read operation. The dummy memory cell has an intermediate electric resistance value of the first and second electric resistance values. The dummy memory cell includes a dummy resistance portion having the first electric resistance value, and a dummy memory cell selection gate connected in series with the dummy resistance portion, and rendered conductive when selected. The second data line is electrically coupled to the dummy resistance portion and the conductive dummy memory cell selection gate and receives the data read current in the data read operation. The data read circuit produces read data based on a voltage change on the first and second data lines. An electric resistance value of the conductive dummy memory cell selection gate is larger than a third electric resistance value and is smaller than a sum of a difference between the second and first electric resistance values and the third electric resistance value. The third electric resistance value is an electric resistance value of the conductive memory cell selection gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each of the memory cell selection gates includes a first field effect transistor, and the dummy memory cell selection gate includes a second field effect transistor having at least one of its gate width and gate length being different from that of the first field effect transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, each of the memory cell selection gates preferably includes a first field effect transistor, and the dummy memory cell selection gate preferably includes a second field effect transistor having the third electric resistance value when rendered conductive, and a third field effect transistor connected in series with the second field effect transistor and having an electric resistance value smaller than the difference when rendered conductive. The second field effect transistor is designed in common with the first field effect transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the dummy resistance portion includes a magnetic storage portion for storing a data level corresponding to the first electric resistance value. The magnetic storage portion included in the dummy resistance portion has a same structure as that of the magnetic storage portion included in each magnetic memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Such a thin film magnetic memory device enables the magnetic storage portion in the magnetic memory cell and the dummy resistance portion in the dummy memory cell to be formed on the same array by using the magnetic storage portions of common design. Accordingly, the electric resistance value of the dummy memory cell can be appropriately set while allowing manufacturing variation. As a result, a read operation margin can be ensured regardless of the manufacturing variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A thin film magnetic memory device according to a further aspect of the present invention includes a plurality of magnetic memory cells, a dummy memory cell, a first data line, a second data line, a data read circuit, and a dummy resistance adding circuit. Each of the plurality of magnetic memory cells stores data written by an applied magnetic field. The dummy memory cell is compared with a selected one of the plurality of magnetic memory cells in data read operation. Each of the magnetic memory cells and the dummy memory cell include a magnetic storage portion having one of a first electric resistance value and a second electric resistance value that is larger than the first electric resistance value, according to a level of the storage data, and a memory cell selection gate connected in series with the magnetic storage portion, and rendered conductive when selected. The magnetic storage portion included in the dummy memory cell stores data at a level corresponding to the first electric resistance value. The first data line is electrically coupled to one of the selected magnetic memory cell and the dummy memory cell in the data read operation. The second data line is electrically coupled to the other of the selected magnetic memory cell and the dummy memory cell in the data read operation. The data read circuit supplies a data read current to each of the first and second data lines and produces read data based on a voltage change on the first and second data lines. The dummy resistance adding circuit selectively connects a resistance portion in series with one of the first and second data lines that is electrically coupled to the dummy memory cell. The resistance portion has an electric resistance value smaller than a difference between the first and second electric resistance values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the resistance portion includes a field effect transistor receiving a variable control voltage at its gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the dummy resistance adding circuit preferably selects one of the first and second data lines to which the resistance portion is connected, according to a part of a row address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Such a thin film magnetic memory device enables the magnetic memory cell and the dummy memory cell to have the same structure. Accordingly, a read operation margin can be ensured according to manufacturing variation of the magnetic memory cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the resistance value of the resistance portion that is connected in series with the dummy memory cell can be adjusted according to the variable control voltage. Therefore, a read operation margin can be ensured according to manufacturing variation of the difference between the electric resistance values of the magnetic storage portion that corresponds to the difference in storage data level. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Note that the same reference numerals and characters denote the same or corresponding portions in the following description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an MRAM device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to a first embodiment of the present invention conducts random access in response to an external control signal CMD and address signal ADD, thereby receiving write data DIN and outputting read data DOUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The MRAM device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a control circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for controlling the overall operation of the MRAM device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in response to the control signal CMD, and a memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a plurality of MTJ memory cells arranged in a matrix. Although the structure of the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be specifically described below, a plurality of write word lines WWL and a plurality of read word lines RWL are provided respectively corresponding to the MTJ memory cell rows. Bit lines BL are provided respectively corresponding to the MTJ memory cell columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The MRAM device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> further includes a row decoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a column decoder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a word line driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a word line current control circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and read/write control circuits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The row decoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> conducts row selection in the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to a row address RA indicated by the address signal ADD. The column decoder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> conducts column selection in the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to a column address CA indicated by the address signal ADD. The word line driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> selectively activates the read word line RWL or the write word line WWL according to the row selection result of the row decoder <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The row address RA and the column address CA together indicate a memory cell selected for the data read or write operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The word line current control circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> applies a data write current to the write word line WWL in the data write operation. For example, the word line current control circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> couples each write word line WWL to the ground voltage VSS, so that the data write current can be applied to the write word line WWL selectively coupled to the power supply voltage VDD by the word line driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The read/write control circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> correctively refers to the circuitry provided in a region adjacent to the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for applying a data write current and a sense current (data read current) to a bit line in the data read and write operations, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> primarily shows the structure associated with the data read operation in the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its peripheral circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes MTJ memory cells MC (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &ldquo;memory cells MC&rdquo;) arranged in n rows by m columns. Each memory cell MC has the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Read word lines RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to RWLn and write word lines WWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to WWLn are provided respectively corresponding to the MTJ memory cell rows (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &ldquo;memory cell rows&rdquo;). Bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm are provided respectively corresponding to the MTJ memory cell columns (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &ldquo;memory cell columns&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> exemplarily shows the write word lines WWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, WWL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, WWLn, read word lines RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RWL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, RWLn, bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, BL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, BLm, and some memory cells corresponding to the first, second and nth rows and the first, second and mth columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the write word lines, read word lines and bit lines are sometimes generally denoted with WWL, RWL and BL, respectively. A specific write word line, read word line and bit line are denoted with, e.g., RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, WWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively. The high voltage state (power supply voltage VDD) and low voltage state (ground voltage VSS) of a signal or a signal line are sometimes referred to as H level and L level, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the data read operation, the word line driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> activates one of the read word lines RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to RWLn to H level according to the decode result of the row address RA, i.e., the row selection result. In response to this, the respective access transistors ATR of the memory cells MC on the selected memory cell row are turned ON, whereby the respective tunnel magnetic resistive elements TMR of the memory cells MC are electrically coupled between the corresponding bit lines BL and the source voltage. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> exemplarily shows the case where the source voltage is set to the ground voltage VSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A data bus DB is provided in a region adjacent to the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to extend in the same direction as that of the read word line RWL and write word line WWL. Column selection lines CSL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to CSLm for conducting column selection are provided respectively corresponding to the memory cell columns. In the data read operation, the column decoder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> activates one of the column selection lines CSL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to CSLm to H level according to the decode result of the column address CA, i.e., the column selection result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Column selection gates CSG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to CSGm are respectively provided between the data bus DB and the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm. Each column selection gate is turned ON in response to activation of a corresponding column selection line. Accordingly, the data bus DB is electrically coupled to the bit line of the selected memory cell column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Note that the column selection lines CSL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to CSLm and the column selection gates CSG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to CSGm are sometimes generally referred to as column selection line CSL and column selection gate CSG, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A data read circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> outputs read data DOUT according to a voltage on the data bus DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the data read circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes a precharging transistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a driving transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a transfer gate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a differential amplifier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and a latch circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The precharging transistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is electrically coupled between a precharge voltage Vpr and the data bus DB, and is turned ON/OFF according to a control signal PR. The control signal PR is rendered active for the precharging period of the data bus DB. In the active period of the MRAM device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the control signal PR is activated to L level at least for a prescribed period before data read operation. During data read operation in the active period of the MRAM device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the control signal PR is inactivated to L level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Although not shown in the figure, the same precharging transistor is provided for every bit line BL, so that each bit line BL is precharged to the precharge voltage Vpr in response to activation of the control signal PR. The precharge voltage Vpr is set in view of the source voltage to which the memory cell MC is coupled. In the present embodiment, the precharge voltage Vpr is set to the ground voltage VSS like the source voltage. Thus, in the precharging period during which the control signal PR is activated to H level, the data bus DB and the bit lines BL are precharged to the ground voltage VSS. In the data read operation, the control signal PR is inactivated to L level, so that the data bus DB is disconnected from the precharge voltage (ground voltage VSS). Accordingly, at the start of the data read operation, a bias voltage applied to both ends of the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR in each memory cell MC is 0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The driving transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is electrically coupled between a driving voltage and the data bus DB, and is turned ON/OFF according to a control signal /RD. The control signal /RD is rendered active for a prescribed period after the start of the data read operation, but is rendered inactive in the other periods. The driving voltage is set to a level different from that of the source voltage to which the memory cell MC is coupled. In the present embodiment, the driving voltage is set to the power supply voltage VDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When the data read operation is started, the data bus DB precharged to the ground voltage VSS is disconnected from the ground voltage VSS (precharge voltage Vpr), and coupled to the power supply voltage VDD (driving voltage). As a result, a sense current Is corresponding to the data read current flows through a path formed from the power supply voltage VDD (driving voltage), data bus DB, bit line of the selected column, selected memory cell, and ground voltage VSS (source voltage). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided between the data bus DB and a node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and includes an operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and capacitors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The precharge voltage Vpr is applied to one input node of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The other input node of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to the data bus DB through the capacitor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The capacitor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (Cc) is electrically coupled between the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the data bus DB. The capacitor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> functions as a charge transfer portion for transmitting a voltage change on the data bus DB due to the sense current Is to the other input node of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the precharging period before data read operation, the data bus DB is set to the precharge voltage Vpr. Therefore, the input voltage difference of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is zero. At this time, an output voltage Vout of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, i.e., a voltage at the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is equal to the power supply voltage VDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the data read operation, the level of the sense current Is varies according to the storage data level in the selected memory cell. The operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives through the capacitor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> an inverted value of the voltage change on the data bus DB due to the sense current Is. The operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> then calculates an integral value of the voltage change on the data bus DB to produce an output voltage Vout. The change rate of the output voltage Vout depends on the sense current Is. Therefore, the storage data level in the selected memory cell can be sensed from the output voltage Vout after a prescribed time period from the start of the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The capacitor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (Cf) is coupled between the node Ni and the data bus DB. The capacitor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> functions as a charge feedback portion for supplying charges according to the voltage change on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to cancel the voltage change on the data bus DB from the precharge voltage Vpr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the capacitor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> feeds back the change in output voltage Vout to the data bus DB, so that the voltage on the data bus DB is retained at the precharge voltage Vpr as before data read operation. This enables suppression of the bias voltage that is applied to both ends of the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR in the selected memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Thus, the charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> produces the output voltage Vout according to an integral value of the sense current Is flowing through the data bus DB, while retaining the voltage on the data bus DB at the precharge voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The differential amplifier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> amplifies the voltage difference between the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to produce read data DOUT. A prescribed reference voltage VREF is applied to the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> amplifies the difference between the output voltage Vout of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the reference voltage VREF for output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The transfer gate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> operates in response to a trigger pulse &phgr;r. In response to the activation period of the trigger pulse &phgr;r, the transfer gate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> transmits the output of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to the latch circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The latch circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> outputs the latched output voltage of the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as read data DOUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the data read operation of the first embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the case where the jth memory cell column is selected for data read operation (where j is a natural number of 1 to m). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the data read operation is started at time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. Before time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, every read word line RWL and column selection line CSL are rendered inactive (L level). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In this period, the precharge control signal PR is rendered active (H level) and the control signal /RD is rendered inactive (H level). Therefore, the data bus DB is precharged to the ground voltage VSS (precharge voltage). As described before, each bit line BL is also precharged to the ground voltage VSS (precharge voltage). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> At time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the data read operation is started, and the control signal /RD is activated to L level for a prescribed period until time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The precharge control signal PR is inactivated to L level. In response to this, the bit lines BL and the data bus DB are disconnected from the precharge voltage (ground voltage VSS) and coupled to the driving voltage (power supply voltage VDD) in the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The word line driver <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> activates the read word line of the selected row to H level. As a result, the memory cells on the selected row are electrically coupled between the respective bit lines BL and the source voltage. The remaining read word lines of the non-selected rows are retained at L level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the column selection line CSLj of the selected column is selectively activated to H level. In response to this, the bit line of the selected column is electrically coupled to the data bus DB. Accordingly, the sense current Is according to the electric resistance value of the selected memory cell flows through a current path formed from the data bus DB (driven to the power supply voltage VDD), bit line BLj, selected memory cell and source voltage (ground voltage VSS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Although not shown in the figure, the remaining column selection lines of the non-selected columns are retained at L level. Therefore, the bit lines BL of the non-selected columns are retained at the precharge voltage. Since the precharge voltage of the bit lines BL is the same as the source voltage of the memory cells MC, an unnecessary charging/discharging current can be prevented from flowing through the bit lines BL of the non-selected columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The change rate of the output voltage Vout from the charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> varies according to the storage data level in the selected memory cell. Therefore, the storage data level in the selected memory cell can be read by sensing the output voltage Vout at fixed timing from the start of the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> At time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i.e., after a prescribed time has passed from the start of the data read operation, the trigger pulse &phgr;r is activated (H level) as a one-shot pulse. The data read circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> amplifies the difference between the output voltage Vout and the reference voltage VREF to produce read data DOUT. The reference voltage VREF is set to an intermediate value of two output voltages Vout at time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which respectively correspond to the case where the storage data is at H level and L level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> retains the data bus DB and the bit line BLj of the selected column at the precharge voltage (ground voltage VSS) as before the data read operation. This enables suppression of the bias voltage that is applied to both ends of the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR of the selected memory cell in the data read operation. Accordingly, a change in electric resistance value in each memory cell according to the storage data level is more likely to appear, allowing for improved speed and stability of the data read operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> First Modification of First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The structure including dummy memory cells DMC for producing the reference voltage VREF for use in the data read circuit will be described in the first modification of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in the first modification of the first embodiment, the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is divided into two memory mats MTa and MTb in the row direction. In each memory mat MTa, MTb, read word lines RWL and write word lines WWL are provided respectively corresponding to the memory cell rows, and bit lines are provided respectively corresponding to the memory cell columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In each memory mat MTa, MTb, m bit lines are provided according to a so-called open bit line structure. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the bit lines in one memory mat MTa are denoted with BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm, whereas the bit lines in the other memory mat MTb are denoted with /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to /BLm. The bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm and /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to /BLm are sometimes generally referred to as bit lines BL and /BL, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In each memory cell row, the memory cells MC are electrically coupled between the respective bit lines and the source voltage. As in the first embodiment, the source voltage is set to the ground voltage VSS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Column selection gates CSG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to CSGma are provided respectively corresponding to the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm of the memory mat MTa. Similarly, column selection gates CSG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to CSGmb are provided respectively corresponding to the bit lines /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to /BLm of the memory mat MTb. The respective column selection gates of the same memory cell column in the memory mats Ma and Mb are controlled by a corresponding common column selection line CSL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In each memory mat MTa, MTb, a plurality of dummy memory cells DMC are arranged in a single dummy row. A plurality of dummy memory cells DMC in the memory mat MTa are respectively provided between the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to BLm and the source voltage (ground voltage VSS). A plurality of dummy memory cells DMC in the memory mat MTb are respectively provided between the bit lines /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to /BLm and the source voltage (ground voltage VSS). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Each dummy memory cell DMC includes a dummy resistance MTJd and a dummy access transistor ATRd that are connected in series between a corresponding bit line BL and the source voltage (ground voltage VSS). The dummy resistance MTJd has an electric resistance value Rd corresponding to an intermediate value of electric resistance values R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the memory cell MC. The memory cell MC has the electric resistance value R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when H level data is stored therein, and has the electric resistance value RO when L level data is stored therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In the memory mat MTa, read word lines RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to RWLka and write word lines WWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to WWLka (where k is an integer given by n/2) are provided respectively corresponding to the memory cell rows. A dummy read word line DRWLa and a dummy write word line DWWLa are also provided corresponding to the dummy row. Note that, although the magnetic data write operation is not necessarily required for the dummy memory cell DMC, it is desired to provide the dummy write word line DWWLa in order to ensure continuity of the shape with the memory cell region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Similarly, in the memory mat MTb, read word lines RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to RWLkb and write word lines WWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to WWLkb are provided respectively corresponding to the memory cell rows. A dummy read word line DRWLb and a dummy write word line DWWLb are also provided corresponding to the dummy row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The dummy read word line DRWLa, DRWLb is activated in the non-selected memory block that does not include the memory cell selected for the data read operation. In the selected memory block including the selected memory cell, a read word line RWL is activated according to the row selection result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> For example, when the selected memory cell is located on the ith row of the memory mat MTa (where i is a natural number), the read word line RWLia is activated (H level) and the dummy read word line DRWLa is retained inactive (L level) in the selected memory mat MTa. In the non-selected memory mat MTb, the dummy read word line DRWLb is activated, whereas every read word line RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to RWLkb is retained inactive (L level). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, when the selected memory cell is located on the ith row of the memory mat MTb, the read word line RWLib is activated (L level) and the dummy read word line DRWLb is retained inactive (L level) in the selected memory mat MTb. In the non-selected memory mat MTa, the dummy read word line DRWLa is activated, whereas every read word line RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to RWLka is retained inactive (L level). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As a result, the memory cell MC is electrically coupled to the bit line of the selected column in the selected memory mat, whereas the dummy memory cell DMC is electrically coupled to the bit line of the selected column in the non-selected memory mat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A data bus /DB that is complementary to the data bus DB is also provided to form a data bus pair DBP with the data bus DB. The bit lines BL and /BL of the selected column are electrically coupled to the data buses DB and /DB through corresponding column selection gates, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> A data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> outputs the read data DOUT according to the voltages on the data buses DB and /DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is different from the data read circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in that the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> further includes a precharging transistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a driving transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for the data bus /DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The precharging transistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the driving transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>operate in the same manner as that of the precharging transistor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the driving transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, before (precharging period) and during data read operation, the voltage on the data bus /DB is set to the same value as that of the voltage on the data bus DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has the same structure as that of the charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and is provided between the data bus /DB and the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes an operational amplifier <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and capacitors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The precharge voltage Vpr is applied to one input node of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The other input node of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to the data bus /DB through the capacitor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (Cc). The capacitor <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> (Cf) is electrically coupled between the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the data bus /DB. The capacitor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> has the same function as that of the capacitor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the capacitor <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> has the same function as that of the capacitor <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Note that the capacitance ratio between the capacitors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> must be designed to the same value as the capacitance ratio between the capacitors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. As long as this capacitance ratio is obtained, the capacitors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the capacitors <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> need not be designed to have the same capacitance value Cc or Cf. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The charge transfer feedback amplifier portion <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> produces an output voltage Vout<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to an integral value of the sense current Is flowing through the data bus /DB, while retaining the data bus /DB at the precharge voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The differential amplifier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> amplifies the difference between the output voltages Vout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vout<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the charge transfer feedback amplifier portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to produces read data DOUT. Since the structure of the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is otherwise the same as that of the data read circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, detailed description thereof will not be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Thus, the reference voltage VREF of the first embodiment can be produced using the dummy memory cell. Therefore, in addition to the structure of the first embodiment, the data read operation can be accurately conducted within a margin of the voltage sensing timing in the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, i.e., the activation timing of the trigger pulse &phgr;r. In other words, a read operation margin can be ensured even if the voltage sensing timing in the data read circuit varies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Second Modification of First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> A simplified structure of the data read circuit will be described in the second modification of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> data read circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the second modification of the first embodiment is different from the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in that the data read circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> further includes a feedback capacitor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> between the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The capacitors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are designed to have a capacitance value Cc, and the capacitors <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and the feedback capacitor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are designed to have a capacitance value Cf. The feedback capacitor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> feeds back with a reversed polarity a voltage change corresponding to an integral value of the sense current Is flowing through the data bus /DB to the data bus DB. The voltage change thus negatively fed back to the data bus DB is applied to the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the capacitor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Thus, the data read circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> outputs an output voltage Vout to the node Ni. The output voltage Vout corresponds to the amplified output voltage difference &ldquo;Vout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Vout<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&rdquo; between the charge transfer feedback amplifier portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In response to the activation period of the trigger pulse &phgr;r, the transfer gate <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> transmits the output voltage Vout on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the latch circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The latch circuit <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> outputs the latched output voltage Vout as read data /DOUT. In other words, the output of the data read circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has a polarity opposite to that of the data bus DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the data read circuit of the second modification of the first embodiment, the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is eliminated. With such a simplified structure, the data read operation can be conducted in the same manner as that of the first modification of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Note that the first and second modifications of the first embodiment are also applicable to a so-called folded bit line structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram showing the structure of a memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its peripheral circuitry according to the folded bit line structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the folded bit line structure, bit line pairs BLP and source lines SL are provided respectively corresponding to the memory cell columns. Each bit line pair BLP is formed from complementary bit lines BL and /BL. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> exemplarily shows the bit line pair BLP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the source line SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first memory cell column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> A column selection gate CSG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided corresponding to the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The column selection gate CSG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a transistor switch T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> electrically coupled between the bit line BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the data bus DB, and a transistor switch T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> electrically coupled between the bit line /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the data bus /DB. The transistor switches T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned ON in response to activation of a corresponding column selection line CSL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the column selection gate CSG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> electrically couples the bit lines BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the data buses DB and /DB, respectively, in response to selection of a corresponding memory cell column in the data read operation. A source voltage, i.e., the ground voltage VSS, is supplied to the source line SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The bit line pair, column selection gate, column selection line and source line are similarly provided for the other memory cell columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Read word lines RWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, RWL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . and write word lines WWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, WWL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . are provided respectively corresponding to the memory cell rows. The memory cells MC on each column are alternately coupled between the bit lines BL, /BL and the source line. For example, for the memory cells MC on the first column, the memory cell MC on the first row is provided between the bit line BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the source line SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the memory cell MC on the second row is provided between the bit line /BL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the source line SL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the memory cells MC on every odd row are provided between the bit lines BL and the source lines SL, and the memory cells MC on every even row are provided between the bit lines /BL and the source lines SL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Thus, when a read word line RWL is selectively activated according to the row selection result, the memory cell MC is coupled between the bit line BL and the source line SL or between the bit line /BL and the source line SL in each memory cell column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Dummy memory cells DMC are arranged in two dummy rows. In each memory cell column, the dummy memory cells DMC are respectively provided between the bit lines BL, /BL and the source line SL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Dummy read word lines DRWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, DRWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and dummy write word lines DWWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, DWWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are provided respectively corresponding to the dummy rows. As described before, the dummy write word lines DWWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, DWWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be provided in view of continuity of the shape with the memory cell region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The dummy read word line DRWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, DRWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is selectively activated so as to couple either the bit line BL or /BL of each bit line pair, i.e., the bit line that is not coupled to the memory cell MC, to the dummy memory cell DMC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the dummy read word line DRWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is activated when an odd row is selected, whereas the dummy read word line DRWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is activated when an even row is selected. As a result, in each memory cell column, one of the memory cell MC and the dummy memory cell DMC is coupled between the bit line BL and the source line SL, and the other is coupled between the bit line /BL and the source line SL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> With such a structure, the data read operation can be conducted in the same manner as that of the first or second modification of the first embodiment by using the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> or the data read circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> for the data buses DB, /DB of the data bus pair DBP electrically coupled to the bit line pair of the selected column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment and the first and second modifications thereof, the precharge voltage Vpr of the bit lines BL, /BL and the data buses DB, /DB as well as the source voltage of the memory cells MC and the dummy memory cells DMC are set to the ground voltage VSS. However, these voltages may alternatively be set to another value such as the power supply voltage VDD or half the power supply voltage VDD, i.e., VDD/2. In this case, the driving voltage in the data read operation must be set in view of the source voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> A variation of the dummy memory cell structure will be described in the second embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows the structure of the memory cell MC for storing the data. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A, a</cross-reference> memory cell MC includes a tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR and an access transistor ATR that are connected in series with each other. The tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR has an electric resistance value of R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> or R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;R (&equals;R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) according to the storage data level. When the access transistor ATR is turned ON (i.e., in a conductive state), the electric resistance value thereof, i.e., the channel resistance value, is R(TG). Accordingly, when the access transistor ATR is conductive, the memory cell MC has an electric resistance value of R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&plus;R(TG) or R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;R&plus;R(TG) according to the storage data level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B, a</cross-reference> dummy memory cell DMC includes a dummy resistive element TMRd and a dummy access transistor ATRd that are connected in series with each other. The dummy resistive element TMRd has an electric resistance value RO. Accordingly, the same tunnel resistive element TMR as that of the memory cell MC can be used as the dummy resistive element TMRd. In other words, the dummy resistive element has a same structure as that of the tunnel resistive element TMR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The dummy access transistor ATRd includes a field effect transistor (FET) Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The channel resistance value of the FET Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is designed to an intermediate value of R(TG) and R(TG)&plus;&Dgr;R, and desirably designed to R(TG)&plus;AR/2 (half of AR). For example, the channel resistance value of the FETQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be adjusted with the gate width and gate length thereof. In other words, the FET Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has at least one of its gate width and its gate length being different from that of the access transistor ATR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the dummy access transistor ATRd is conductive, the dummy memory cell DMC has an electric resistance value of R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&plus;R(TG)&plus;&Dgr;R/2, i.e., an intermediate value of R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&plus;R(TG) and R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;R(TG). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference> shows another exemplary structure of the dummy memory cell DMC. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>C, the dummy memory cell DMC includes a dummy resistive element TMRd and a dummy access transistor ATRd that are connected in series with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Like the dummy memory cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the dummy resistive element TMR is formed from the same tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR as that of the memory cell MC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The dummy access transistor ATRd includes field effect transistors (FETs) Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The FET Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is designed to have a channel resistance value R(TG). In other words, the FET Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be designed in common with the access transistor ATR of the memory cell MC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The FET Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is designed to have a channel resistance value smaller than &Dgr;R, and desirably to have a channel resistance value &Dgr;R/2. Like the FET Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the channel resistance value of the FET Q<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be adjusted with the gate width and gate length thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the dummy access transistor ATRd is conductive, the dummy memory cell DMC has an electric resistance value of R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&plus;R(TG)&plus;AR/2, as in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Before data read operation, a data level corresponding to the electric resistance value R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is magnetically written to the tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR of the dummy memory cell DMC. Thus, the electric resistance value of the dummy resistive element TMRd can be set to RO. The data write operation to the dummy memory cell may either be conducted as part of the initialization sequence upon power-ON of the MRAM device, or may be conducted periodically during operation of the MRAM device. For example, the data write operation to the dummy memory cell may be conducted in each cycle upon every memory access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> When fabricated on the same memory array under the same manufacturing conditions, the tunnel magnetic resistive elements TMR are likely to have the same characteristics. Therefore, by forming both memory cell MC and dummy memory cell DMC with the same tunnel magnetic resistive element TMR, the electric resistance value of the dummy memory cell DMC can be reliably set to an intermediate value of R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and RO. Thus, the electric resistance value of the dummy memory cell DMC for producing a voltage for comparison with the voltage on the data line coupled to the selected memory cell can be appropriately set while allowing manufacturing variation. As a result, a read operation margin can be ensured regardless of the manufacturing variation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The dummy memory cell of the second embodiment is typically applicable to the memory array of the open bit line structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or the memory array of the folded bit line structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this case, the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> or the data read circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> can be used for the data read operation. The charge transfer feedback amplifier portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be eliminated from these data read circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> First Modification of Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The structure of the memory cell MC shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> is the same as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. Therefore, detailed description thereof will not be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, the dummy memory cell DMC is designed so that the dummy resistive element TMRd has an electric resistance value R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the dummy access transistor ATRd has a channel resistance value R(TG). In other words, the dummy memory cell DMC and the memory cell MC can be fabricated on the same memory array according to the common design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The first modification of the second embodiment further includes a dummy resistance adding circuit for adding an electric resistance value &Dgr;R/2, i.e., an electric resistance value to be added by the dummy memory cell DMC, to one of the data buses DB and /DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the dummy resistance adding circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is provided between the data buses DB, /DB and a data read circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The structure of the data read circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> corresponds to the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> with its charge transfer feedback amplifier portions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> eliminated therefrom. Alternatively, the data read circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may be used instead of the data read circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The dummy resistance adding circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has data bus connection switches <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and a resistive element <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The electric resistance value of the resistive element <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is set to a value equal to or less than the difference AR between the electric resistance values R<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the memory cell MC, and desirably set to &Dgr;R/2. The resistive element <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is series-connected to one input node ND. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The data bus connection switch <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> electrically couples the data bus DB to one of the input nodes ND and /ND. The data bus connection switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> operates complementarily to the data bus connection switch <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and electrically couples the data bus /DB to the other input node ND, /ND. Thus, the resistive element <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> can be series-connected to one of the data buses DB and /DB, i.e., the data bus that is connected to the dummy memory cell DMC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The data bus switch <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> electrically couples one of the data buses DB, /DB, i.e., the data bus that is connected to the dummy memory cell DMC, to the input node ND through the resistive element <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The other data bus, i.e., the data bus that is connected to the selected memory cell, is electrically coupled directly to the input node /ND. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> For example, the data bus connection switches <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> may operate according to the least significant bit RA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the row address. In the memory array of the open bit line structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the address bit RA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> indicates whether the selected memory cell is located in the memory mat MTa or MTb. In the memory array of the folded bit line structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the address bit RA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> indicates whether the selected row is an odd row or an even row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> With such a structure, the electric resistance value of the sense current path including the dummy memory cell DMC can be set to the same value as that of the second embodiment. Moreover, according to the first modification of the second embodiment, the memory cell MC and the dummy memory cell DMC in the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have the same structure. Therefore, a read operation margin can be ensured according to manufacturing variation of the tunnel magnetic resistive elements TMR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Second Modification of Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> dummy resistance adding circuit <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> according to the second modification of the second embodiment is different from the dummy resistance adding circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> in that the resistive element <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is replaced with a field effect transistor (FET) <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The FET <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is coupled in series to a node ND, and receives a control voltage Vm at its gate. The structure and operation of the dummy resistance adding circuit <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> are otherwise the same as those of the dummy resistance adding circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Since the structure and operation other than the dummy resistance adding circuit are also the same as those of the first modification of the second embodiment, detailed description thereof will not be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> With such a structure, the electric resistance value of the FET <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, i.e., the electric resistance value to be added from the dummy resistance adding circuit <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> to the sense current path including the dummy memory cell DMC, can be adjusted according to the control voltage Vm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Thus, in addition to the structure of the first modification of the second embodiment, a read operation margin can be ensured according to manufacturing variation of the electric resistance difference AR in the tunnel magnetic resistive elements TMR fabricated on the memory array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Although the access elements such as access transistor and dummy access transistor are formed from a field effect transistor in the embodiments of the present invention, a diode may alternatively be applied to the access elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the sprit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>
