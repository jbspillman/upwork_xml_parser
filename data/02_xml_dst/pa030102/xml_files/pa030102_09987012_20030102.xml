<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims priority and is based on Japanese Patent Application 2001-198595, filed on Jun. 29, 2001, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor wafer device and its manufacture method, and more particularly to a semiconductor wafer device having a damascene wiring structure and its manufacture method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In this specification, an etching stopper layer is intended to mean a layer having an etch rate of one fifth or smaller than an etch rate of another layer under etching, in order that even if the etching stopper layer is exposed during etching, this etching stopper layer is prevented from being etched excessively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> B) Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A higher integration density of semiconductor devices is desired increasingly. Conventionally, a wiring pattern is formed by forming an Al wiring layer or a W wiring layer on an insulating layer, thereafter forming an etching mask made of a resist pattern or the like on the wiring layer, patterning the wiring layer and embedding it with another the insulating layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As the integration density becomes high, there are needs of narrowing a width of a wiring pattern and a pitch between wiring patterns. Such fine patterning is now confronted in some cases to a limit in the techniques of forming a wiring pattern by directly pattering a wiring layer. This process is gradually replaced by a damascene wiring process by which a wiring groove and a via hole are formed in an insulating layer, a wiring layer is deposited on the insulation film, being filled in these wiring groove and via hole, and an unnecessary wiring layer on the top surface of the insulating layer is removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As the wiring material, Cu is used recently which has a lower resistivity and a higher electro migration resistance than Al, Al alloy, W and the like. Although Cu provides excellent performances as the wiring material, it is likely to be oxidized forming an oxide film thereon, the oxide being not as chemically stable as the oxide of Al. It is necessary therefore to pay attention to a wiring structure and a wiring forming process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a damascene process of connecting upper and lower wiring patterns by a via conductor, a single damascene process and a dual damascene process are known. In the single damascene process, a via hole is formed through a lower interlevel insulating film, a via conductor is filled in the via hole, thereafter an upper interlevel insulating film is formed, a wiring groove is formed, and then a wiring pattern is filled in the wiring groove. In the dual damascene process, after a via hole and a wiring groove are formed in an interlevel insulating film, wiring material is filled in the via hole and wiring groove at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As the dual damascene process, there are a first-via type that a via hole is first formed and then a wiring groove is formed and a last-via type that a via hole is formed after a wiring groove is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As the wiring density becomes high, a capacitance between wiring patterns is likely to become high. As the capacitance of a wiring pattern becomes high, a signal transmission speed lowers. In order to reduce the capacitance of a wiring pattern, it is effective to lower the dielectric constant of an insulating layer. In addition to a conventional silicon oxide insulating layer, other insulating layers have been used recently, such as: an insulating layer made of silicon oxide doped with fluorine or carbon; an insulating layer made of coating type hydrocarbon-containing organic insulating material; an insulating layer made of coating type inorganic insulating material; and a porous insulating layer containing voids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These wiring techniques have not been developed sufficiently. It may occur that if techniques are improved in one aspect, a problem at another point occurs and a percentage of defective devices increases. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Prior to describing the embodiments, fundamental issues to be studied will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>D are schematic cross sectional views of a semiconductor wafer device illustrating an example of a dual damascene wiring process. The left portion of each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>D shows an effective wafer area of a semiconductor wafer in which effective circuit chips are formed, and the right portion shows a noneffective wafer area in which effective circuit chips are not formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, on an underlying structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are stacked. The underlying structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is, for example, a structure having a semiconductor substrate formed with semiconductor devices on which an insulating film with W plugs filled therein is formed. The underlying structure may be a single damascene wiring structure with only via conductors. A first photoresist layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having openings of wiring patterns (including conductor patterns to be described later) is formed on the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The noneffective wafer area is not formed with circuits. However, in order to mitigate the influence of a change in process parameters upon the whole wafer area, conductor patterns analogous to the wiring patterns in the effective wafer area are formed in the noneffective wafer area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> By using the first photoresist layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as a mask, the underlying insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is etched by reactive ion etching using CF-containing plasm. This etching automatically stops at the first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Next, ashing by O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas plasma is performed to remove the first photoresist layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this case, since the conductor on the surface of the underlying structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is covered with the first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, oxidation can be prevented. After the first photoresist layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is removed, the exposed etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed by RIE using CHF-containing etching gas. In this manner, wiring grooves are formed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B, a</cross-reference> first barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed by sputtering, covering the inner surfaces of the wiring grooves. Thereafter, a first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed by sputtering or plating. If the first main wiring layer is formed by plating, first a seed layer is formed by sputtering, and then the remaining main wiring layer is formed on the seed layer by plating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed, the first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and first barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> higher than the surface of the first insulating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). The first main wiring layer is made of, for example, Cu. If this first main wiring layer is exposed in the air, it is easily oxidized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, immediately after CMP, the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is covered with a second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having an oxygen shielding function. A second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed on the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, the surface of the first insulating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the upper surfaces of the first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> filled in the wiring groove and the first barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are drawn evenly. However, in practice, if overpolishing of CMP is performed, a dishing phenomenon occurs in which the first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and first barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are indented lower than the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> formed thereon also have indented shapes in the dishing areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>G are cross sectional views explaining the dishing phenomenon and its influence. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference> shows the case that the barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have the same etching rate and are indented by the same depth from the surface of the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</cross-reference> shows the case that the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are sequentially formed on the surface having dishing areas. In he process of forming an insulating layer, although the surface of the insulating layer corresponding to a narrow concave portion on the underlying structure has a possibility of being planarized, the surface of the insulating layer corresponding to a broad concave portion cannot be planarized and has a concave shape. The surface of the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a recess in the broad dishing area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</cross-reference> shows the case that a damascene wiring structure is formed on an insulating layer influenced by dishing. After wiring grooves are formed through the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a main wiring layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed, the barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and main wiring layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the surface of the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are removed by CMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> There is a possibility that the barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and main wiring layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> deposited in the recessed surface areas of the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> subjected to dishing are left even after CMP. A wiring pattern extending right from the right damascene wiring pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</cross-reference> corresponds to the recessed surface area. A wiring pattern becomes different from a desired wiring pattern and there is a possibility that desired electric characteristics cannot be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13F</cross-reference> shows another example of the influence of dishing. Three wiring patterns are formed through the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The surface of the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a dishing recess in which two wiring patterns are formed. The barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and main wiring layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed in the recess are not completely removed by CMP and a fraction thereof is left. Therefore, the two wiring patterns are electrically shorted by the left main wiring layer and barrier metal layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13G</cross-reference> is a schematic cross sectional view showing the structure of the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is subjected to CMP to planarize the surface thereof in order to avoid the influence of dishing. The surface of the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is planarized by CMP. The third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> formed thereon have, therefore, flat surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C, in order to avoid the influence of dishing, after the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed, its surface is planarized by CMP. It is difficult to perform CMP uniformly over the whole wafer surface. The wafer peripheral area is likely to be polished more than the wafer central area, because of a distribution of a pressure applied to the wafer, a distribution of a slurry supply amount and the like. There is, therefore, a tendency that the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> after CMP is thick in the wafer central area and thin in the wafer peripheral area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> After CMP, on the surface of the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed. On the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a second photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a via hole pattern is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> By using the second photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are etched by RIE using CF-containing etching gas. By controlling the etching conditions, the etching is stopped at the surface of the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the second photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is removed by ashing using O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas plasma. In this case, the surface of the first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the effective wafer area is covered with the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so that the first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is protected from O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a new photoresist layer is formed on the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by protecting the inside of the via holes if necessary. Openings are formed through the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. By using the photoresist layer as a mask, the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is etched. After the new photoresist layer is removed, the exposed third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are removed and wiring grooves and via holes are formed. A conductive layer is filled in the wiring grooves and via holes at the same time. An unnecessary conductive layer is removed by CMP to complete the dual damascene wiring structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>D, while the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the effective wafer area is etched, etching the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the noneffective wafer area near the wafer periphery is completed and the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is gradually etched and the surface of the first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may bet-exposed. As the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is exposed during RIE using CF-containing gas, there is a possibility that the surface of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is decomposed by CF-containing gas. If the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is exposed to O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas plasma during ashing for removing a resist layer to be performed later, the surface of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is oxidized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The noneffective wafer area is an area not intended to be used for forming circuits. Even if the surface of the main wiring layer is decomposed, the structure in the effective wafer area is not directly influenced. However, for example, an oxidized main wiring layer increases its volume. Decomposition lowers adhesion to a nearby interlevel insulating film. At later wafer processes such as heat treatment and polishing, film peel-off or the like occurs at the wafer periphery or the like. The peeled-off film moves toward the effective wafer area so that the percentage of defective devices in the effective wafer area increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Such phenomena are not limited only to the dual damascene wiring process, but occur also for the single damascene wiring process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</cross-reference> show the case that a single damascene wiring structure is formed. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, the processes of forming the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and planarizing the surface by CMP are similar to those described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</cross-reference>. On the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having openings for a via hole pattern is formed. By using this photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is etched. Similar to the effective wafer area, the via hole pattern is also distributed in the noneffective wafer area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B, after via holes are formed through the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the effective wafer area, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is removed by ashing. While the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the effective wafer area is etched, etching the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the noneffective wafer area is completed, the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is gradually etched and the underlying main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is exposed during etching using CF-containing gas, the main wiring layer may be decomposed. During ashing for removing the photoresist layer to be performed later, the surface of the exposed main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is oxidized (indicated at <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>x </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>). As above, also in the single damascene process, similar problems to the dual damascene process occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent the upper level wiring layer from being influenced by dishing, it is necessary to perform CMP. As CMP is performed, there arises another problem that the thickness of the insulating layer becomes thin in the peripheral wafer area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>I illustrate the main processes of a method of manufacturing a semiconductor wafer device according to an embodiment of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C are schematic cross sectional views of a semiconductor wafer, the left portion indicating the effective wafer area in which semiconductor circuits are formed, and the right portion indicating the noneffective wafer area in which effective circuits are not formed. The noneffective wafer area is also called a peripheral wafer area because it is disposed around the effective wafer area. Of the peripheral wafer area, an area having a constant width from the edge of the wafer is called a wafer edge area. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference> is a plan view of the semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on an underlying structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed on the first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, the underlying structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a structure having MOSFET&apos;s formed in active regions of the semiconductor wafer and an insulating film formed over MOSFET&apos;s and embedded with W plugs, or a structure having a higher level wiring layer with via conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of, for example, an SiN layer of 50 nm thick and has an oxygen shielding function, an etching stopper function and a Cu diffusion preventing function. The first insulating film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made of, for example, an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer of 500 nm thick. On the surface of the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having openings for wiring patterns (including conductor patterns not used as actual wiring) is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> By using the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is etched by reactive ion etching (RIE) using CF-containing etching gas, this etching being stopped at the first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is removed by ashing using O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-containing gas plasma. During this ashing, since the underlying structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is covered with the first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the surface of conductors in the underlying structure is prevented from being oxidized. Thereafter, the first etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> exposed in the wiring groove is removed by RIE using CHF-containing etching gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> For example, the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer is etched by using mixed gas of CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>(or C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>)/Ar/O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as etchant, and the SiN layer is etched by using CHF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/Ar/O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as etchant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> first barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are formed on the structure with wiring grooves. For example, the barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is made of a Ta layer of 50 nm thick, and the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made of a Cu layer of 1500 nm. The barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed by sputtering, and the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed by sputtering or plating. For example, if the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed by plating, first a Cu seed layer is formed by sputtering and then a Cu layer having the remaining thickness is formed on the Cu seed by plating. After the barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are formed, the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the surface of the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, after the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the surface of the first insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are removed by CMP, a second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the semiconductor wafer to protect the surface of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For example, the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is made of an SiN layer of 50 nm thick. On the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> made of, for example, an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer of 1200 nm thick is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> After the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed, CMP is performed to planarize the surface thereof. For example, if the second insulating film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the effective wafer area is polished by a thickness of 500 nm to leave the layer of 700 nm thick, the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the peripheral wafer area is polished by a thickness of 900 nm to leave the layer of 300 nm thick. Although the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of 700 nm thick is left in the effective wafer area, the insulating film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the peripheral wafer area has a thickness which is a half or thinner than that in the effective wafer area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> After CMP, a third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For example, the third etching stopper layer is made of an SiN layer of 50 nm thick, and the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made of an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer of 500 nm thick. On the surface of the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having openings for via conductor hole patterns is formed. The hole pattern is formed only in the effective wafer area, and not formed in the peripheral wafer area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference> is a plan view of the wafer. In the effective wafer area indicated by hatched lines, hole patterns are formed, whereas in the peripheral wafer area around the effective wafer area, hole patterns are not formed. Since hole patterns are not formed in the peripheral wafer area, it is possible to prevent the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from being etched and the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from being oxidized and decomposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Reverting to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, by using the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are etched by using CF-containing etching gas, CHF-containing etching gas or the like. This etching is stopped at the surface of the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by controlling the etching conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Since hole patterns do not exist in the peripheral wafer area, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> protects the surface of the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the underlying third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are left as they are. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Although hole patterns are formed only in the effective wafer area, the area occupied by the hole patterns is small so that the degree of unstable etching in the effective wafer area to be caused by the distribution of process parameters is small. After this etching, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is removed by ashing using O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>E, non-photosensitive resin is coated on the surface of the semiconductor wafer and melted from its surface to leave fillers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of non-photosensitive resin only in the via holes. Thereafter, a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> having openings for wiring patterns (including conductor patterns) is formed on the surface of the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The wiring patterns of the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed not only in the effective wafer area but also in the peripheral wafer area. Namely, by forming wiring patterns over the whole area of the wafer, it becomes possible to mitigate a degree of a distribution, in the wafer, of process parameters such as an etching rate and a polishing speed having the effect upon the effective wafer area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</cross-reference> is a plan view showing the area where the wiring patterns are formed in the semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i.e., the whole area of the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, by using the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is etched by RIE using CF-containing etching gas. This etching progresses generally uniformly over the whole wafer area because the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has generally the same thickness over the whole wafer area, forms wiring grooves in the effective wafer area and peripheral wafer area, and stops at the surface of the third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The surfaces of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the peripheral wafer area are covered with the third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> so that decomposition and oxidation can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>F, after the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is etched, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is removed by ashing using O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma. The non-photosensitive resin fillers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are removed at the same time. The third etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> exposed on the bottom of the wiring groove and the second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> exposed on the bottom of the via hole are removed by RIE using CHF-containing etching gas. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H, a</cross-reference> second barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a second main wiring layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of the semiconductor wafer with wiring grooves and via holes. Similar to the first barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and first main wiring layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the barrier metal layer is formed by sputtering and the main wiring layer is formed by sputtering or plating. Thereafter, the second main wiring layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and second barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> deposited on the surface of the third insulating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are removed by CMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I, a</cross-reference> fourth etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface of the semiconductor wafer, covering the second main wiring layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> after CMP. If the second main wiring layer is the uppermost wiring layer, a surface protective layer is formed in place of the etching stopper layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> With the above processes, in the effective wafer area, wiring layers of the dual damascene structure are formed, and in the peripheral wafer area, a single damascene structure with only conductor patterns not functioning as wiring is formed. Since the single damascene structure with only conductor patterns not functioning as wiring is formed in the peripheral wafer area, it is possible to prevent the surface of the underlying conductor patterns from being oxidized or decomposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The multi-layer wiring of the dual damascene structure has been described above. Similar structure can be adopted for the single damascene wiring structure. </paragraph>

Thereafter, a second etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of the semiconductor wafer, and the surface of the second insulating layer is planarized by CMP. CMP has a tendency that the thickness of the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the peripheral wafer area becomes thinner then the thickness of the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the effective wafer area. On the surface of the second insulating layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> after CMP, a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having openings for via hole patterns is formed.

In the above embodiments, SiN is used as the material of the etching stopper layer, and silicon oxide is used as the material of the insulating latter. In order to reduce a capacitance of a wiring, an insulating layer of a low dielectric constant can be used. However, a low dielectric constant insulating layer has generally a low density and the characteristics that liquid and gas are transmitted or absorbed. From this reason, it is difficult to form an insulating layer of the multi-layer wiring structure only by using an insulating film of a low dielectric constant. It is preferable to mixedly use an insulating layer having a strong wiring protection function such as silicon oxide. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Although the four-layer wiring structure has been described, the number of wiring layers can be increased or reduced as desired. In place of a lamination of the organic insulating film and upper insulating layer, a lamination of an etching stopper layer and an insulating layer may be used. A laminated insulating layer including a low dielectric constant insulating layer such as a silicon oxide layer containing fluorine or carbon and a porous silicon oxide layer may also be used. It is obvious to those skilled in the art that other structures of the interlevel insulating film may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> It has been found that a new problem occurs if a coating type organic insulating film such as SiLK is used as part of the interlevel insulating film. A coating type insulating film and a photoresist layer have a thickness in the wafer edge area different from a thickness in the central wafer area, and may become in contact with a cassette or the like during transportation thereof. It is general therefore to remove a coated film in the wafer edge area by rinsing or peripheral exposure. This process will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, on an underlying structure <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, an organic insulating film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> made of, for example, SiLK, is coated to a thickness of 250 nm. For example, the underlying structure <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is a structure that conductive plugs are embedded in the first lower insulating layer da<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Conductive plugs are not formed in the wafer edge area. Coated material in the peripheral wafer area is removed by rinsing using etchant by about 3 mm&plusmn;0.5 mm from the wafer edge. Next, an insulating film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> made of, for example, a silicon oxide film of about 250 nm thick, is deposited by CVD to cover the whole surface of the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> On the insulating layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> having openings for wiring patterns is formed.

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> By using the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is etched by RIE using CF-containing etching gas or the like. Next, by using the patterned insulating layer <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> as a mask, the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is etched by RIE using H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-containing or N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-containing etching gas or the like. In this case, the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is etched at the same time. In each etched wiring groove (including each groove for the conductor pattern), the side wall of the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is exposed. At the same time, the outermost side wall of the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>

For example, a Cu layer of 1500 nm thick is used as the main wiring layer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, an unnecessary wiring layer deposited on the insulating layer is removed by CMP. With this CMP, the peripheral wafer area is strongly over-polished than the central wafer area so that the wiring layer outside the outermost side wall of the insulating layer is removed. The polishing speed of CMP is decided by a pressure distribution, a chemical etching rate relative to chemicals in slurry, and the like. Generally, a polishing speed is higher in the peripheral wafer area than in the central wafer area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In the wafer edge area, the side wall of the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is exposed so that water contents contained in chemicals such as slurry used by CMP, organic substances contained in the air and the like are attached to the exposed side wall.

<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9E</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>L are cross sectional views illustrating the processes of forming a dual damascene wiring structure such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>I, following the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>E, on the etching stopper layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> made of an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer of about 1200 nm thick is formed by CVD. After the insulating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is deposited, the surface thereof is planarized by CMP. With this CMP, the remaining film thickness in the effective wafer area is, for example, about 700 nm and that in the wafer edge area is, for example, about 300 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> After CMP, an organic insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> made of SiLK or the like is coated on the insulating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to a thickness of, for example, 250 nm. After coating, the organic insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is removed by a constant width from the wafer edge. The organic insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is then cured by heat treatment. On this organic insulating film <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> made of an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer or the like having a thickness of about 250 nm is formed by CVD. On the insulating layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a metal layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is formed which is made of, for example, a TiN layer of 100 nm thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> On this metal layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, a resist pattern <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed. The resist pattern is removed by a constant distance from a wafer edge, for example, by 5 mm&plusmn;0.5 mm by peripheral exposure. The resist pattern <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has openings for wiring grooves. By using the resist pattern <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the metal layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is etched.

<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>G, by using the insulating layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is etched by using H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-containing gas, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>containing gas or the like. With this etching, the resist pattern <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is also etched. In the effective wafer area, the insulating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is exposed on the bottom of each via hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>H, by using the metal layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as an etching mask, the insulating layers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are etched. In the effective wafer area, the etching stopper <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is exposed and the etching stops in the state that the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is exposed. In the wafer edge area where the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> was removed, the insulating layers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are etched. There is no problem of over-etching in this area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, by using the metal layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and insulating layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as an etching mask and changing the etching gas to H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-containing or H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-containing etching gas, the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is etched.

<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>K, on the interlevel insulating film structure formed with wiring grooves and via holes, a wiring layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of a barrier layer and a main wiring layer is deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>L, the wiring layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is polished by CMP from its surface to remove unnecessary regions of the wiring layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and metal layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. In this case, in the wafer edge area, polishing is stopped in the state that the wiring layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> covers the side wall of the organic insulating layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. An etching stopper layer made of, for example, an SiN layer of 50 nm thick or a surface protective layer is formed covering the surface of the wiring layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In the above description, a dual damascene wiring structure covering the outermost side wall of the organic insulating layer with the wiring layer is formed. Instead, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, it is obvious to those skilled in the art that a dual damascene wiring structure covering the outermost side wall of the organic insulating layer with the insulating layer may be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments. The invention is not limited only to the above to follow, a single damascene structure having only conductor patterns is formed in the wafer edge area. Even if this structure is omitted, the outermost side wall of a low dielectric constant insulating layer can be protected from a CMP environment. It is apparent that various modifications, improvements, combinations, and the like can be made by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
