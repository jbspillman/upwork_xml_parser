<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a cross sectional view depicting a problem of the prior art semiconductor device. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, in a prior art process, silicon substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is exposed in an oxidizing atmosphere while oxide layer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> is being formed. During the exposure, an oxygen gas permeates through silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and oxide layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> so as to reach silicon substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the portions of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that are in contact with surface <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>s are oxidized to become oxide layer <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Oxide layer <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, which is larger in volume than silicon, causes crystal defects in its vicinity. The occurrence of such crystal defects in the channel portions under floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> makes arsenic in impurity regions <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> be captured by the crystal defects, which shortens the substantial channel length. Supplying a potential difference across adjacent impurity regions in the transistors will cause a current to flow continuously due to the punch through between the source and the drain. This causes a problem that a selected memory cell transistor malfunctions, thereby deteriorating the reliability of the semiconductor device. There is a similar problem in forming oxide films of dielectric film <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, which is an ONO film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view depicting another problem of the prior art semiconductor device. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, electrons usually travel in the direction indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> between the source and the drain. However, some of the electrons traveling from the source to the drain proceed in the direction indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and are captured by the trap level in gate insulator film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, which is referred to as a hot electron phenomenon. The phenomenon causes the threshold voltage of the transistors to fluctuate, thereby decreasing the reliability of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention, which has been contrived to solve the aforementioned problems, has an object of providing a highly reliable semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device of the present invention includes a semiconductor substrate, a gate electrode, a side-wall insulator layer, and a nitrogen-containing layer. The semiconductor substrate includes a first surface and a second surface which is adjacent to the first surface and defines trenches. The gate electrode has side wall, and is formed on the first surface of the semiconductor substrate with a gate insulator film interposed therebetween. The side-wall insulator layer is formed on the side wall and on a portion of the first surface. The nitrogen-containing layer is so formed as to extend from the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of second surface to the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the interface between the side-wall insulator layer and the semiconductor substrate. The nitrogen-containing layer has a higher concentration of nitrogen than the first surface of the semiconductor substrate under the gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device thus structured, the nitrogen-containing layer is so formed as to extend from the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the second surface defining the trench to the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the interface between the side-wall insulator layer and the semiconductor substrate. In this region, the presence of nitrogen in the semiconductor substrate protects the substrate from being oxidized. Consequently, the semiconductor substrate is prevented from increasing in volume, which eliminates the possibility of the occurrence of a crystal defect. Hence, a punch through phenomenon is prevented so as to provide a highly reliable semiconductor device. In addition, the formation of the nitrogen-containing layer in the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the interface between the side-wall insulator layer and the semiconductor substrate decreases the density of a trap level in the insulator layer formed in this region. This decrease suppresses the capture of electrons, so as to obtain a highly reliable semiconductor device. Moreover, the nitrogen-containing layer has a higher concentration of nitrogen than the first surface of the semiconductor substrate that is under the gate electrode, so that the concentration of nitrogen is low in the channel regions under the gate electrode. As a result, a highly reliable semiconductor device capable of preventing the fluctuation of the threshold value can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the semiconductor device further includes an impurity region formed in the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is under the side-wall insulator layer. In this case, the occurrence of a punch through across the impurity regions can be prevented, so as to provide a highly reliable semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the semiconductor device further includes a buried insulator layer to fill the trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable that the semiconductor device further includes a control gate electrode formed on the gate electrode with a dielectric film interposed therebetween. In this case, a highly reliable nonvolatile semiconductor storage device can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the gate electrode includes a lower conductor layer so formed as to be in contact with the gate insulator film, and a upper conductor layer formed on the lower conductor layer opposite to face the control gate electrode, and the upper conductor layer has a larger width than the lower conductor layer. In this case, the upper conductor layer having a larger width than the lower conductor layer increases the area in which the upper conductor layer faces the control gate electrode. As a result, the capacity between the control gate electrode and the upper conductor layer increases, thereby providing a nonvolatile semiconductor storage device capable of operating with less voltage supplied to the control gate electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the semiconductor device further includes an oxide layer formed on the second surface. In this case, the oxide layer formed on the second surface prevents the occurrence of an interface level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the oxide layer is formed between the nitrogen-containing layer and the second surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The method for fabricating the semiconductor device of the present invention includes the steps of: forming gate electrode having side wall on a first surface of a semiconductor substrate with a gate insulator film interposed therebetween; forming a side-wall insulator layer on the side wall of the gate electrode and on a portion of the first surface; forming a trench defined by a second surface in the semiconductor substrate by etching the semiconductor substrate using the gate electrode and the side-wall insulator layer as a mask; and forming a nitrogen-containing layer extending from the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the second surface to the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the interface between the side-wall insulator layers and the semiconductor substrate by maintaining the semiconductor substrate in an atmosphere containing either nitrogen or a nitrogen compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to the method for fabricating the semiconductor device including the above-described steps, the nitrogen-containing layer is so formed as to extend from the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the second surface defining the trenches to the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the interface between the side-wall insulator layer and the semiconductor substrate. In this region, the presence of nitrogen in the semiconductor substrate protects the substrate from being oxidized. Consequently, the semiconductor substrate is prevented from increasing in volume, which eliminates the possibility of the occurrence of a crystal defect. Hence, the punch through phenomenon is prevented so as to provide a highly reliable semiconductor device. In addition, the formation of the nitrogen-containing layer in the portion of the semiconductor substrate that is in the vicinity of the interface between the side-wall insulator layer and the semiconductor substrate decreases the density of the trap level in the insulator layer formed in this region. This decrease suppresses the capture of electrons, thereby realizing a highly reliable semiconductor device. Moreover, the nitrogen-containing layer has a higher concentration of nitrogen than the first surface of the semiconductor substrate that is under the gate electrodes, so that the concentration of nitrogen is low in the channel regions under the gate electrodes. As a result, a highly reliable semiconductor device capable of preventing a fluctuation in threshold value can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the method for fabricating the semiconductor device further including the step of forming an oxide layer by oxidizing the second surface before forming the nitrogen-containing layer. In this case, the oxide layer prevents the occurrence of an interface level in the second surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the method for fabricating the semiconductor device further including the step of forming impurity regions in the portions of the semiconductor substrate that are at both sides of each of the gate electrode by implanting an impurity into the semiconductor substrate while using the gate electrode as a mask after the formation of the gate electrode and before the formation of the side-wall insulator layer. In this case, the punch through phenomenon across the impurity regions is prevented so as to provide a highly reliable semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the method for fabricating the semiconductor device further includes the step of forming a buried insulator layer to fill the trench after the formation of the nitrogen-containing layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, maintaining the semiconductor substrate in the atmosphere containing either nitrogen or the nitrogen compound includes maintaining the semiconductor substrate in an atmosphere of nitric oxide. In this case, the present of nitric oxide further decreases crystal defects in the side-wall insulator film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In readout operation, in memory cell transistors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> not selected, control gate electrode <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is grounded (Vcg&equals;0V), the drain region (one of high-concentration impurity regions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) is supplied with a voltage of 3.3 V, and the source region (the other one of high-concentration impurity regions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) and silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are made to have a ground potential. Assuming that 0V&lt;Vthe&lt;Vthp, no current flows between the source and the drain of memory cell transistors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at Vcg&equals;0 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A current flows between the source and the drain only in selected memory cell transistors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that are in the vanished condition, out of all memory cell transistors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, data in each memory cell are detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device of the present invention, nitrogen-containing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a high concentration of nitrogen is formed in the vicinity of second surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>s </italic></highlight>of trenches <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h. </italic></highlight>Since nitrogen-containing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> blocks the permeation of oxygen through it, silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is prevented from being oxidized in the oxidizing process after the formation of nitrogen-containing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Consequently, silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not swell, causing no stress inside it. This can prevent the occurrence of crystal defects in silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the channel length of memory cell transistors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from decreasing. As a result, a source-drain punch through can be prevented so as to realize a highly reliable semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In addition, the formation of nitrogen-containing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by nitriding the interface between first and second side-wall insulator layers <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> decreases the density of trap level at the interface. The decrease in the density prevents electrons from being captured in the interface, thereby providing memory cell transistors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having little fluctuation in threshold voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Nitrogen is not implanted very much into the channel regions under floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which prevents the threshold value from fluctuating, and boron in channel dope regions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from becoming inert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention have been described hereinbefore; however, these embodiments can be modified variously. First, as a method for forming nitrogen-containing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, either an ammonia gas (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) or dinitrogen oxide (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) can be used in place of nitric oxide used in the above-mentioned mixture gas consisting of a nitric oxide gas and a nitrogen gas. Besides the thermal nitriding method, a nitriding method with the use of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, NO, or NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>plasma can be adopted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The thickness of nitrogen-containing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be varied as needed. Floating gate electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have a two-layer structure consisting of lower conductor layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and upper conductor layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>; instead, they may have a single-layer structure. Moreover, the present invention can be applied to a DRAM (dynamic random access memory), a SRAM (static random access memory), or the like, besides the above-mentioned nonvolatile semiconductor storage device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a highly reliable semiconductor device can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>
