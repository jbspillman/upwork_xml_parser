<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a fastening device, and more particularly, to a fastening device which is easy to assemble and disassemble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Computer has become an important tool rather than a simple calculator or word processor. Daily activities including looking for information, writing a report, chatting, reading news, briefing, sending an e-mail, etc., all can be done through a computer. Since computers are so close to our life, consumers have higher and higher expectation to the computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Taking a desktop computer for example, general desktop computers comprise the separate type computers and the all-in-one type computers. The so-called separate type computer refers to a computer system wherein a display unit and a computer unit are separated from each other, and the all-in-one type computer refers to a computer system wherein the display and the computer unit are integrated as a whole. These two types of computer systems have their own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of the separate type computer are easy to be maintained and low cost of upgrade, but the disadvantage resides in its bulky volume. The advantages of the all-in-one type computer reside in its small volume, and its whole appearance can be better designed to produce a unique valuable sense to inspire the consumers with interest in using. However, since the computer unit and display unit of the all-in-one type computer cannot be separated from each other, it is difficult to be maintained. Further, since most of the all-in-one type computers use expensive liquid crystal display units and when upgrading, the all-in-one type computer needs to replace the whole computer system, it is impossible to separate the liquid crystal display unit from the whole computer unit and thus leads to high cost of upgrade. </paragraph>
