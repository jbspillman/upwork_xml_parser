<heading lvl="1">1 FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The field of the invention relates to methods and devices for qualitatively and quantitatively observing nucleic acids in a sample of nucleic acids, and more particularly to methods and devices that recognize the presence of a set of subsequences in each nucleic acid in the sample and identify the nucleic acid from a set of subsequences by reference to a database of sequences likely to be present in the sample. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">2 BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Modem biology teaches the importance of genes and gene expression to processes of health and disease. New individual genes causing or predisposing to conditions or diseases are now reported almost daily. Additionally, it is commonly understood that observing and measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression in health and disease will contribute immensely to further understanding of these states. Therefore, any observational method that can rapidly, accurately, and economically observe and measure the presence or expression of selected individual genes or of whole genomes will be of great value. Of even more value will be methods that can directly and quantitatively be applied to the complex mixtures of genomic DNA (&ldquo;gDNA&rdquo;) samples or expressed DNA (&ldquo;cDNA&rdquo;) samples (synthesized from selected RNA pools) that are typically derived directly from biological samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Current observation and measurement methods suffer from one or more disadvantages that render them unnecessarily inaccurate, time consuming, labor intensive, or expensive. Such disadvantages flow from requirements for, e.g., prior knowledge of gene sequences, cloning of complex mixtures of sequences into many individual samples each of a single sequence, repetitive sequencing of sample nucleic acids, electrophoretic separations of nucleic acid fragments, and so forth. For example, observation techniques for individual mRNA or cDNA molecules, such as Northern blot analysis, RNase protection, or selective hybridization to arrayed cDNA libraries (see Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning&mdash;A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York (1989)) depend on specific hybridization of a single oligonucleotide probe complementary to the known sequence of an individual molecule. Since a single human cell is estimated to express 10,000-30,000 genes (Liang et al., Science, 257:967-971 (1992)), most of which remain unknown, single probe methods to identify all sequences in a complex sample are prohibitively cumbersome and time consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Similarly, traditional nucleic acid sequencing (Sanger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74:5463-5467 (1977)), sequencing by hybridization (&ldquo;SBH&rdquo;) using combinatorial probe libraries (Drmanac et al., Science 260:1649-1652 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,202,231, Apr. 13, 1993 to Drmanac et al.), or classification by oligomer sequence signatures (Lennon et al., Trends Genetics 7:314-317 (1991)), and positional SBH (Broude et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3072-3076 (1994)) also require that samples be arrayed into purified clones, making the methods inappropriate for complex mixtures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Several approaches have been described that attempt to characterize complex mixtures of nucleic acids without cloning, all of which at least require electrophoretic separation and/or traditional sequencing. A basic approach is that of differential display (Liang et al., Science 257:967-71 (1992); Liang et al., Curr. Op. Immunol. 7:274-280 (1995)), which uses the polymerase chain reaction (&ldquo;PCR&rdquo;) with an oligo (dT) primer and a degenerate primer designed to hybridize within a few hundred bases of the cDNA 3&prime;-end. The resulting DNA subsequences of varying length are electrophoretically separated to yield a pattern of, preferably, 100-250 bands. This approach, at best providing only qualitative &ldquo;fingerprints&rdquo; of gene expression, suffers from well-known problems, including a high false positive rate, migration of multiple nucleic acid species within a single observed band, and non-quantitative results. Further, putative gene identification depends on purification and traditional sequencing of the components in electrophoretic bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Additionally, approaches have been described which attempt to improve differential display, but without obviating the need for traditional sequencing and/or electrophoretic separation. For example, a method described in European Patent Application 0 534 858 A1 (published Mar. 31, 1993), is directed to applying differential display to gDNA samples by using restriction endonuclease (&ldquo;RE&rdquo;) digestion together with PCR employing phasing primers in order to reduce the complexity of such samples to levels electrophoretically observable. The multiple phasing primers divide the gDNA samples in multiple pools of lower complexity, which are electrophoretically separated to yield qualitative &ldquo;fingerprints.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other methods improving on differential display include the following, all of which are similarly limited to generating electrophoretic &ldquo;fingerprints.&rdquo; One such improvement is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,937 (Oct. 17, 1995). This method generates multiple pools of lower complexity by using sequential rounds of PCR applied to 3&prime;-end fragments of cDNAs. The 3&prime;-end fragments lie between a recognition site for a frequently-cutting RE and the poly(A) tail of the cDNA. Fragments in the multiple pools are finally putatively identified by electrophoretic separation and individual sequencing. Another example of such an improvement is described by Prashar et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:659-663 (1996). Primarily, this reference describes an alternative method for generating similar 3&prime;-end fragments, which lie between a recognition site for a frequently-cutting RE and the poly(A) tail of the cDNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Differing from differential display is another class of methods, which observe gene expression by sampling, that is, these methods repetitively sequence nucleic acids in a sample and count the sequence occurrences in order to statistically observe gene expression. Such methods require sequencing and are statistically limited in their ability to discover rare transcripts. An early example of such a method determined and counted expressed sequence tags (&ldquo;ESTs&rdquo;), and is described in Adams et al., Science, 252:1651-1656 (1991). Another example is named &ldquo;serial analysis of gene expression&rdquo; (Velculescu et al., Science, 270:484-487 (1995)). According to this method, cDNA molecules are converted into representative &ldquo;tags,&rdquo; which are short oligonucleotides generated from Type IIS RE single-stranded overhangs located at determined distances from the 3&prime;-end of source cDNA. (Type IIS REs cleave a defined distance (up to 20 bp) away from their asymmetric recognition sites (Szybalski, Gene 40:169 (1985)). Approximate, putative identification of the source of a tag requires sequencing the tag and using the sequence and location information to look up possible source sequences in a nucleic acid sequence database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other methods for gene and gene-expression measurement, although unrelated to differential display, still have certain disadvantages, such as, e.g., requiring electrophoretic separation. Such a method is described in PCT Publication WO 97/15690, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. According to this method &ldquo;signals&rdquo; are generated that represent the length of a nucleotide sequence between defined subsequences in a target nucleic acid. The defined subsequences are preferably restriction endonuclease sites or oligomer binding sites. These signals can then be compared to results of computer simulated signal generation experiments using computer databases of nucleic acid sequences. By this comparison, particular DNA sequences in the database can be identified as present in sample, since they are predicted to generate signals which are also observed. The length information of the signals of this method is, disadvantageously, observed electrophoretically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> All methods previously described for the analysis of complex mixtures of nucleic acids require electrophoretic separation, possibly together with nucleic acid cloning and sequencing. These procedures can be unnecessarily labor intensive, slow, and uneconomical. Recently new approaches have been reported that can, in some implementations, obviate the need for, at least, electrophoretic separation. Such methods depend on hybridization of probe oligonucleotides to recognize short subsequences of from 4 to 20 base pairs on target nucleic acids. The oligonucleotides can be either present in solution or arrayed on a planar surface, such as a glass chip (&ldquo;chip&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Subsequence recognition by hybridization performed in solution, however, often requires electrophoretic separation. Methods reported in Smith, PCR Methods and Applications 2:21-27 (1992) and in Unrau et al., Gene, 145:163-169 (1994) use type IIS or interrupted palindromic (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) REs to create single-stranded overhangs of unknown sequence from a sample of cDNAs. These overhangs are recognized by hybridization to a plurality of degenerate adapters (called &ldquo;indexers&rdquo; in the latter reference), each possible overhang being recognizable by the one adapter having a complementary single-stranded terminus. The adapters also include primer sequences, and successful hybridization of an adapter is detected by electrophoretic separation of PCR amplification products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Hybridization specificity can be improved by using a ligase, which requires exact base-pairing for ligation. See, e.g., Landegren et al., Science 241, 1077-1080 (1988), in which hybridization is only recognized if two probe oligonucleotides hybridize to adjacent position on a target DNA sequence and are ligated by T4 DNA ligase. &ldquo;Strand-invasion&rdquo; (Guilfoyle et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25:1854-1858 (1997)) is an extension of the indexing approach designed to further improve hybridization specificity. In strand-invasion, the duplex adapter, or indexer, has a longer single-stranded terminus which has a few determined nucleotides terminal to the previously described degenerate subsequence. The extra, determined nucleotides &ldquo;invade&rdquo; into and base pair with a known terminal subsequence of the RE recognition sites, which is adjacent to the unknown single-stranded overhangs that the indexers recognize, thereby improving hybridization stringency. Again, successfully hybridized adapters are recognized by PCR amplification and electrophoretic separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Electrophoretic separations can be obviated by arraying the probe oligonucleotides on a chip. Such chips can be prepared by depositing already synthesized oligonucleotide on a derivatized glass surface, or by synthesizing the oligonucleotide directly on the glass surface using a combination of photolithography and oligonucleotide chemistry (McCall et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 93:13555-13560 (1996)). These probe oligonucleotides are typically designed to hybridize to 10, 15, or 20 bases of a target DNA. Chips capable of recognizing in principle up to 6500 genes have been prepared. The chips are hybridized to samples of fluorescently tagged target DNAs, and are then imaged to determine to which oligonucleotides hybridization has occurred though some success has been reported with such chips, well-known problems remain, including those of obtaining unambiguous and reliable hybridization signals. Current methods for solving such signal to noise problems call for the use of significantly redundant sets of probe oligonucleotides. For example, to observe one subsequence of one gene currently requires the synthesis of multiple (greater than 20 per gene) overlapping and mismatched oligonucleotide probes in order to obtain statistically significant data, including data necessary to apply corrections for mismatched hybridizations or non-specific binding. The need for such redundancy of immobilized probes poses serious throughput and cost limitations, especially in view of the 130,000 or so genes possibly expressed in human tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Various hybridization alternatives include the use of arrays of peptide nucleic acids (&ldquo;PNA&rdquo;) (Weiler et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25, 2792-2799 (1997)). PNAs, having the bases linked via N-(2-aminomethyl)-glycine moiety, obey Watson-Crick base-pairing rules with DNA but with greater stability than corresponding DNA:DNA hybrids. In another alternative, PCR amplified target DNAs, prepared perhaps from ESTs or cDNA libraries, are physically tethered onto planar surface instead of arrays of probe oligonucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Therefore, these described observational methods for gene-expression are not capable of rapidly, accurately, and economically observing and measuring the presence or expression of selected individual genes or of whole genomes. These methods typically require, for example, prior knowledge of gene sequences, or cloning of complex mixtures of sequences into many individual samples of a single sequence, or repetitive sequencing of sample components, or electrophoretic separations, and so forth. Importantly, they have not been able to accurately and economically utilize the potential of arrayed oligonucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an observational method that overcomes these disadvantages will be of great value. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">3 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is a broad object of this invention to provide methods and devices for observing and measuring the presence and expression of individual genes or entire genomes that overcome the previously described problems. In particular, the methods and devices of the instant invention make accurate and efficient use of arrayed oligonucleotides (called herein a universal detection array or &ldquo;UDA&rdquo;) to avoid any requirements for cloning of complex mixtures of sequences into many individual samples of a single sequence, repetitive sequencing of sample components, electrophoretic separations, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The methods of this invention identify and quantify nucleic acids in a sample by observing the presence of sequence sets in nucleic acids in a sample. A sequence set, in a preferred but non-limiting embodiment, includes three subsequences, a first and second primary subsequence and an additional subsequence. The subsequences have certain preferred positional constants, including (i) that the additional subsequence is spaced apart from the first primary subsequence by a fixed number of nucleotides in all sequence sets, and (ii) that the second primary subsequence is spaced apart from both the first primary and the additional subsequence by a variable number of nucleotides. Where the first primary and the additional subsequence are positioned adjacently, the sequence set can be considered to include only two independent subsequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Once having observed sequence sets from a nucleic acid sample, they can be interpreted with reference to a database of nucleic acid sequences. A sequence set defines a search query which can be used to scan a database of nucleic acid sequences for those sequences having the particular sequence set. Any sequences found are sequences of nucleic acids likely to be present in the original sample of nucleic acids. If no such sequences are found, then a novel nucleic acid, which generates such sequence sets, likely exists in the sample. Preferably, the database includes sequences of nucleic acids likely to be present in the sample, perhaps produced by a pre-selection step from a more general nucleic acid sequence database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the search query defined by the sequence set is represented as a regular expression, which is used by regular expression search tools to search nucleic acid sequences represented as symbol strings. In an alternate embodiment, an index of subsequences present in the database of nucleotide sequences is first constructed. Second, using this index, sequences are searched for the regular expression representing a sequence set. This alternative embodiment is preferred in the case of repetitive searches of the same sequence database because it increases search efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The lengths of the subsequences in a sequence set are chosen in order to obtain adequate resolution and separation of the gene-calling methods. Resolution, defining how precisely a sequence set identifies a nucleic acid, is therefore related to how many sequences in the sequence database have a particular sequence set. Separation defines how accurately and uniquely the observation methods observe a sequence set. In the preferred embodiment, where a UDA of this invention observes the additional sequences in a subsample in parallel, separation improves with decreasing complexity of subsamples. Both these measures are improved by longer subsequences. However, longer subsequences result in increased numbers of subsamples (see below) necessary for adequate coverage. Generally, for nucleic acids derived from expressed human genes, preferred lengths for the subsequences are between 4 and 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Preferred methods for observing sequence sets in a sample of nucleic acids generally proceed in two steps. In a first step, a subsample of nucleic acid fragments is formed having those nucleic acids that have selected sequences for the first and second primary subsequences. In a second step, the sequence of the additional subsequence in nucleic acid fragments of the subsample is determined. By forming a plurality of subsamples, each subsample having different selected primary subsequences, there can be a high likelihood that each nucleic acid in the sample will be represented in at least one subsample (that is, the &ldquo;coverage&rdquo; of the original sample is adequate). Preferably, the length and sequence of the primary subsequences are chosen to minimize the number of subsamples for adequate coverage in view of the previously described considerations of resolution and separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In more detail, preferred methods for the first step produce a subsample by digesting the original sample with restriction endonuclease (&ldquo;RE&rdquo;) enzymes that digest nucleic acids within their recognition sequence and produce single-stranded terminal overhangs. The primary subsequences recognized are therefore the recognition sequences of such REs. Complementary adapters are ligated to these terminal overhangs, either simultaneously with or sequentially to RE digestion. One such adapter preferably has a conjugated biotin (or other capture moiety) to aid in removing improperly digested or undigested fragments from the reaction products. The other adapter preferably has a subsequence which is the recognition site of a restriction endonuclease that digests nucleic acids outside of its recognition site (a Type IIS RE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferred methods for the second step determine the additional subsequences of all the nucleic acids in a subsample simultaneously and in parallel by hybridization of the additional subsequences to an array of probes. To facilitate such a hybridization, a further digestion of the nucleic acid fragments leaves remaining fragments having the additional subsequences as partially single-stranded terminal subsequences. In one embodiment, the additional subsequences are the single-stranded terminal subsequence; and in an alternative embodiment, the additional subsequences include both the single-stranded terminal subsequence and adjacent double-stranded portions of the remaining fragments. This second digestion is preferably with a Type IIS RE, whose recognition site is positioned on one of the previous complementary adapters in view of the length and placement of the additional sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The probes of the probe array have terminal subsequences for hybridizing with and recognizing the terminal additional subsequences. Where all nucleic acids in a sample are to be identified, the probe array includes probes with all possible terminal subsequences for recognizing all possible additional subsequences. In this case, for improved separation, the number of fragments in the subsample of fragments is advantageously less than the number of probes in the array, and the length of the additional subsequence can be chosen accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, techniques are employed to improve the specificity and strength of probe and fragment hybridization, especially in view of the length of the additional subsequences, which can be as short as 4 nucleotides. One technique employs stacking oligomers that hybridize to the probe adjacent to the hybridized fragments. Energetic base stacking interactions between the hybridized stacking oligomer and fragment improve overall hybridized duplex stability. Another technique employs a ligase enzyme to ligate nicks only in those hybridization structures that are fully and correctly hybridized, followed by a wash step to remove mis-hybridized, and, therefore, un-ligated fragments and stacking oligomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Where the additional subsequence is only single-stranded, a correctly hybridized structure of the fragment, the probe, and the stacking oligomer is a duplex with no nucleotide gaps. Where the additional subsequence includes also an adjacent double-stranded subsequence which hybridizes with the probe, the hybridized structure has one strand of the fragment partially &ldquo;displaced&rdquo; by the &ldquo;invading&rdquo; strand of the probe, forming what is called a &ldquo;displacement structure.&rdquo; The nucleotide sequence of the additional sequence is determined by detecting to which probes fragments have hybridized. In various embodiments, either the fragment, the stacking oligomer, or both can be labeled, for example by fluorescent dyes, and the hybridization can be detected by optical or laser stimulation of the dyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, hybridization and ligation conditions are selected so that the amount of hybridized fragment reflects the concentration of the original fragment in the subsample, and thus that of the original nucleic acid in the sample. To achieve such responsiveness, the concentration of the fragment is made less that the concentration of the probe in order to avoid probe saturation, and the time of hybridization is made less than the time for complete hybridization in order to avoid fragment depletion. Fragments are taken to be not depleted when, preferably, more than &frac14; of their initial concentration remains, and more preferably, when more than &frac12; remains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the UDA, the probes are attached to solid supports, which are preferably planar glass surfaces or glass beads. Therefore, probes have a linker region of sufficient length in order to reduce stearic hindrance to hybridization due to the surface attachment, and a functional group in order to bind to corresponding groups on the solid supports. Preferably, an amino functional group binds to isothiocyanate groups on derivitized glass surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> This invention is also directed to observing specific and known nucleic acids in the original sample. In this case, the sequence sets to be observed are chosen to be those present in the specific nucleic acids. Subsamples are generated only for the primary subsequences present in the chosen sequence sets, and probe arrays need only include probes for the additional subsequences present in the chosen sequence sets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Applications of the general gene-calling methods of the invention include observing differential gene expression between pairs of tissues in defined biological states. In this case, the original sample of nucleic acids can be cDNA synthesized from mRNA harvested from the tissues according to methods known in the art. Such differential expression information has many known and developing uses. Applications of these methods directed only to specific genes include, for example, diagnostic or therapeutic tests of the presence and expression of disease-related genes. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">5 DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The instant invention relates to methods and devices for identifying and quantifying nucleic acids in a sample of nucleic acids (also referred to herein as &ldquo;gene-calling&rdquo;), and in particular to methods and devices for genomic analysis. Accordingly, this invention can be applied to analysis of gene expression by identifying and quantifying complementary DNA (&ldquo;cDNA&rdquo;) and to genetic analysis by identifying and quantifying genomic DNA (&ldquo;gDNA&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The gene-calling methods of this invention start, in general, with a possibly complex sample of nucleic acids, preferably DNAs, and observe the presence of sets of nucleotide subsequences (&ldquo;subsequence sets&rdquo;) in the nucleic acids of the sample. Then with reference to a database of nucleotide sequences of nucleic acids that may be in the original sample, the methods determine which sequences have the observed subsequence sets, and which observed subsequence sets are not present in any sequence in the database. Accordingly, nucleic acids in the original sample are either identified or marked as possibly novel. In preferred embodiments, methods quantitatively identify the presence of subsequence sets in order that nucleic acids can in turn be quantitatively identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A subsequence set includes at least two, non-adjacent nucleotide subsequences in a nucleic acid. Preferred embodiments observe a subsequence set by observing two &ldquo;primary&rdquo; subsequences and an &ldquo;additional&rdquo; subsequence. In case the additional subsequence and one of the primary subsequences are adjacent, these subsequences can be considered a single subsequence, and the subsequence set includes only two subsequences. Equivalently, in this case the subsequence set can be considered as including three subsequences, which are the two primary subsequences and the additional subsequence. In case the additional subsequence is not adjacent to either of the primary subsequences, the subsequence set includes these three subsequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the methods of this invention observe the primary and the additional subsequences sequentially in at least two steps. The preferred methods first produce one or more less complex subsamples of nucleic acid fragments, each nucleic acid in a subsample being derived from those nucleic acids in the original sample which include the two initially specified, primary subsequences in the original nucleic acid. These subsamples are produced from the original sample in a manner which is repeatable and results in predictable fragments. Several such limited-complexity subsamples (defined by different primary subsequences) can be produced, all of which together adequately sample all the nucleic acids in the original sample. Next, the preferred embodiment observes (or recognizes) the additional subsequence in each fragment of the subsample. This subsequence can be from 4, to 8, to 10 or more base pairs (&ldquo;bp&rdquo;), and is preferably 5, 6, or 7 bps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Finally, the methods of this invention comprise computer-implemented nucleic acid database searches, which determine less than 5-10, and preferably only one, candidate sequences that could produce a fragment in the particular predictable manner and that also includes the particular additional subsequence. In other words, the computer-implemented methods determine which database sequences have the observed sequence sets. Thereby, nucleic acids in the original sample are determined. Preferably, at least the determination of the additional subsequence returns quantitative information of the relative abundance of the particular fragments in order that the abundance of the nucleic acids in the sample can be quantitated. In a preferred embodiment, the initially specified subsequences are recognition sites for Type II restriction endonucleases (&ldquo;RE&rdquo;) (an RE cutting a double stranded nucleic acid within its recognition site), and the additional subsequence is determined as the sequence of an overhang produced by digestion by a Type IIS restriction endonuclease (an RE cutting a double stranded nucleic acid outside of its recognition site). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> This invention also relates to devices which allow the rapid and high-throughput determination of this additional subsequence without requiring conventional cloning and/or sequencing and the attendant cumbersome electrophoretic separations required, and to methods for the use of such devices. These devices are based on novel implementations and uses of arrays of oligonucleotides preferably attached to a planar surface, such as a glass chip (also referred to herein as &ldquo;universal detection arrays&rdquo;). These arrays are adapted to the specific and reliable determination of short single strand overhangs and include error checking structures to minimize false positives. Reliability is enhanced by the use of enzymatic recognition of correct hybridization, such as by a ligase, as well as by the use of energetic hybridization assists, such as by base stacking and strand-invasion. These arrays are used in the general gene-calling methods of this invention according to implementations which include ligation alone as well as strand-invasion with ligation. Advantageously, these arrays permit the parallel and quantitative determination of additional subsequences in all the fragments of a subsample without the need to separate the individual fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the following, the methods for gene calling are first generally described in Section 5.1 followed in Section 5.2 by a description of the universal detection arrays and their methods of use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">5.1 Methods for Gene-calling </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Generally, the methods for gene-calling, and also for identifying particular nucleic acids, in a sample of a plurality of nucleic acids, proceed, first, by determining, or recognizing, the presence of a set of nucleotide subsequences (&ldquo;subsequence set&rdquo;) in a nucleic acid of the sample, and second, by using such a determination to actually identify that nucleic acid with reference to a database of sequences of nucleic acids that might be present in the sample. The subsequence set preferably consists of two primary subsequences and an additional subsequence. Additionally and importantly, where one or more of the physical signals by which a subsequence set is identified provide also a quantitative indication of the amount of the containing nucleic acid, these methods can be applied to the valuable task of determining the relative levels of gene expression, as well as simply identifying the presence of a particular nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> This section describes, first, general requirements on the subsequence set, in particular on the preferable lengths of the subsequences, and second, various applications of the general method of gene-calling. Next, this section describes in separate subsections the principal steps of a preferred method of gene-calling. The principal steps includes: generation of subsamples of nucleic acid fragments from original nucleic acids having specified primary subsequences; determination of an additional subsequence in generated fragments; search of a database of nucleotide sequences; and optionally, confirmation steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Gene-calling Methods in General </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Turning now to a preferred structure for subsequence sets, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> generally illustrates a subsequence set in nucleic acid <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> present in the original sample. A subsequence set is described herein without limitation as being a set of three nucleotide subsequences with particular positional constraints. It will become apparent to one of average skill in the art upon study of this description and accompanying examples that the general methods of this invention can be applied to subsequences sets having different numbers of subsequences with different positional constraints between the elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Turning to the described embodiment, a subsequence set comprises three subsequences: primary subsequences <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, also called herein subsequences S1 and S2, together with additional subsequence <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, also called herein subsequence A1. The positional constraints include the following. Primary subsequence <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, S1, and additional subsequence <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, A1, are constrained to be a fixed number of nucleotides, or distance, apart. Preferably S1 and A1 are adjacent. On the other hand primary subsequence <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, S1, and primary subsequence <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, S2, are not constrained to be a fixed distance apart. Finally, additional subsequence <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, A1, is constrained to lie between primary subsequences <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, S1, and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, S2. Although these three subsequences are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as if they are internally contiguous, this invention is not so limited. For example, in the case where these subsequences are recognized as being the binding sites of REs (or of other DNA binding proteins) (also known herein as a &ldquo;recognition site&rdquo;), these subsequences may be interrupted by one or more undetermined nucleotides. REs possessing interrupted recognition sites (for example, interrupted palindromic REs) are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The lengths of the subsequences are chosen, in general, to insure adequate resolution and separation of the gene-calling methods of this invention. Resolution of gene-calling methods is herein taken to mean how uniquely a nucleic acid in the original sample can be identified with respect to a database of nucleic acid sequences likely to be present in the sample. It is preferable that each nucleic acid in the sample be identified as originating from no more than approximately ten candidate nucleic acid sequences in such a database, more preferably from no more than approximately five candidate nucleic acid sequences, and most preferably from no more than approximately one candidate nucleic acid sequence. Resolution depends on how many sequences on average in the database share a particular subsequence set with the same particular subsequences. Separation of gene-calling methods is herein taken to mean how uniquely a particular subsequence set can be recognized by the particular observational methods. It is preferable that each observation is produced by no more than two nucleic acids with a particular subsequence set. Most preferably each observation uniquely identifies a nucleic acid with a particular subsequence set. Separation depends on the particular observational methods and is discussed below with respect to particular embodiments of these methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the following paragraphs, subsequence length preferences in view of adequate resolution are first discussed followed by the subsequence length preferences in view of adequate separation. Finally, overall length preferences in view of both goals are discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Concerning resolution, the longer the subsequences&mdash;S1, S2, and A1 &mdash;the better the resolution with respect to a sequence database of a certain complexity. Complexity of a sequence database or of a sample of nucleic acids is taken herein to mean the total length in nucleotides of the sequences in the database or in the sample. Resolution improves with longer subsequences, because fewer database sequences share any particular longer subsequence. In the case application of the instant method to expressed DNA sequences, that is of cDNA samples, an analysis similar to the following leads to preferable subsequence lengths. One of skill in the art will be able to adapt the following analysis to nucleic acid samples of differing complexity, such as genomic or expressed nucleic acids from various organisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Table 1 is an exemplary approximate analysis of resolution requirements for subsequence lengths for the case of the expressed human genome. For constructing this table, the human genome is taken to consist of approximately 100,000 sequences of approximately 3,000 nucleotides length. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,037. This invention is not limited to the exemplary values illustrated in Table 1. Upon reading the following description, one of ordinary skill will understand how to adapt this invention to other values for Table 1.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In this table, the first column sets out possible exemplary values for the sum of the lengths of S1 and A1. The second column sets out the approximate probability of finding S1 and A1 in a fixed relative position in a typical expressed sequence of length 3,000 nucleotides. The third column sets out the approximate number out of the 100,000 genes that contain S1, S2, and A1 in case the length of S2 is 6 nucleotides. The fourth column has the same values in case the length of S2 is 7 nucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> This table is constructed in the following manner. Since primary sequence S1 and additional sequence A1 are constrained to be in a fixed relative position, the probability of their occurrence in a 3000 base length of nucleic acid is approximately 3000 divided by 4 raised to the power which is the sum of the length of S1 and the length of A1, as is well known to those of ordinary skill. This probability and subsequent probabilities are estimated by assuming subsequences are randomly occurring. This and subsequent tables and analyses can be refined by using exact probabilities obtained from scanning nucleotide sequence databases for observed probabilities. For example, if the length of S1 is 6 and the length of A1 is 5, then the probability is 3000/4<highlight><superscript>&minus;(6&plus;5)</superscript></highlight>, or 3000/4<highlight><superscript>&minus;11</superscript></highlight>, which is 7.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4</superscript></highlight>. In case, the length of S2 is 6, the probability of finding S2 at any distance from S1 and A1 is a complex function depending in the exact sequence of S2. Herein, this probability is conservatively taken to be approximately &frac18; (ignoring positional constraints), which results from assuming that S2 can have approximately 500 independent positions with respect to S1 and A1 in a sample nucleic acid (&frac18;&equals;500/4<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>). Therefore, the resolution, or the number of database sequences containing this sequence set, is the probability in column <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, multiplied by 100,000, and further multiplied by &frac18;. In case the length of S2 is 7, the probability of S2 is taken to be {fraction (1/32)}. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, for this exemplary analysis, it is preferred for the sum of the lengths of S1 and A1 to be at least 11 and for the length of S2 to be at least 6. Alternately, it is preferred for the sum of the lengths of S1 and A1 to be at least 10 and for the length of S2 to be at least 7. It is more preferred for the sum of the lengths of S1 and A1 to be at least 12 and for the length of S2 to be at least 6. Alternately, it is preferred for the sum of the lengths of S1 and A1 to be at least 11 and for the length of S2 to be at least 7. The length of additional subsequence A1 is not limited to be the length of the single-stranded overhang of a Type IIS RE. For example, a UDA used according to strand-invasion ligation recognizes terminal subsequences including short double-stranded portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> More particularly, where the subsequences are recognized by restriction endonucleases (&ldquo;REs&rdquo;), S1 and S2 can be preferably recognized by Type II REs with six base pair recognition sites, and A1 can be the sequence of the overhang generated by a Type IIS RE that produces a five base overhang. HgaI is such a Type IIS RE (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). More preferably, the Type IIS RE produces a six base overhang. Cjel and CjePI are similar REs which cut outside their recognition region, however on both sides of this region. (Vitor et al., Gene 157:109-110 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Next, criteria related to separation are discussed with respect to a particular observational method. For the sake of illustration only, and without limitation, these criteria are discussed with respect to a preferred observational method, which generally proceeds according to two steps. From study of the subsequent description, one of ordinary skill will know how to adapt these criteria and this invention to other observational methods. Such alternative methods might simultaneously recognize all subsequences of a subsequence set, for example by including a step of simultaneous hybridization of three distinguishably labeled probes to the sample of nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred two step method, first, a subsample of nucleic acids, or of nucleic acid fragments, is produced from an original sample by selecting only those nucleic acids that have two selected primary sequences, S1 and S2. By varying the selected S1 and S2, a sufficient plurality of subsamples can be produced which adequately sample the nucleic acids in the original sample (see below for a description of &ldquo;coverage&rdquo;). Second, additional subsequence A1, in a fixed relation to S1, is determined on the fragments in the subsample. A preferred embodiment of this two step observational method is discussed below in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2. The ease of unambiguously determining additional sequence A1, and hence the quality of separation, depend on the number of fragments in the subsample. The fewer the number of fragments in a subsample, the fewer possible additional subsequence A1 that need to be unambiguously determined. Further, the number of fragments in the subsample depends primarily on the lengths of primary subsequences S1 and S2, which are used to select the subsample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Table 2 is an exemplary analysis of the number of fragments in a subsample versus primary subsequence lengths. For constructing this table, approximately 10,000 sequences of approximately 3,000 nucleotides length are taken to be expressed in a typical human tissue. This invention is not limited to the exemplary values illustrated in Table 2. Upon reading the following description, one of ordinary skill will understand how to adapt this invention to other values for Table 2.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In this table, the first two columns set out possible values for the lengths of S1 and S2. The third column sets out the approximate probability of finding S1 and S2 in any relative position in a typical expressed sequence of length 3,000 nucleotides. The fourth column sets out the approximate number of fragments that contain S1 and S2 in a subsample arising from an original expressed sample of 10,000 expressed sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> his table is constructed quite similarly to Table 1. The probability of any nucleic acid of length 3000 nucleotides from the original sample containing primary sequences S1 and S2 in any relation is the probability of finding S1 anywhere in a 3000 base length of nucleic acid multiplied by the probability of finding S2 in any relation to S1 in such a nucleic acid. As previously, this first probability factor is approximately 3000 divided by 4 raised to the power which is the length of S1. Also as previously, this second probability factor is a complex function which is taken (again ignoring positional constraints) to be &frac18; in case the length of S2 is 6, and to be {fraction (1/32)}in case the length of S2 is 7. For example, if the lengths of S1 and S2 are 6 then this probability is (3000/4<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>)&times;(&frac18;), which is 0.091. Finally, the number of fragments in a subsample is the probability of column three multiplied by 10,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Table 2 is useful in assessing methods to determine additional subsequence A1. A preferred method for this determination has certain important properties. One important property necessary for high-throughput of the overall gene-calling method is that a subsequence determination method be able to determine all the sequences in a subsample simultaneously and in parallel. Any method that requires cloning, separation, separate handling, or separate sequencing of the fragments of a subsample is less preferable. Also, electrophoretic separation steps are also less preferable since they typically require manual preparation steps. Clearly the ability to determine subsequences in a subsample in parallel is dependent on the number of possible subsequences, as reflected in the total number of fragments in a sample. The fewer the fragments the easier the parallel subsequence determination. On the other hand, fewer fragments in a subsample require production of more subsamples in order to adequately sample the nucleic acids in the original sample. Consequently, it is preferable to have subsamples which are at the parallel detection limit of a subsequence determination method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A second important property is that a subsequence determination method be able to determine both the nucleotide sequence and also the quantitative presence of additional subsequence A1. When coupled with methods of producing subsamples that result in amounts of subsample fragments being quantitatively determined by original nucleic acid amounts, such determination method permit quantitative gene expression analysis. Quantitative gene expression is one important application of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> This invention is adaptable to any method for determining additional subsequences, which preferably has the previous important parallel and quantitative characteristics. However, for the sake of illustration only, and without limitation, this invention is discussed in the following primarily with respect to a preferred observational method, which generally proceeds by hybridizing the fragments of the subsample to a set of probes, such as degenerate oligonucleotides, capable of hybridizing with all additional subsequences that might be present in the subsample. In addition, peptido-nucleic acids (&ldquo;PNAs&rdquo;) can be used as probes. From study of the subsequent description, one of ordinary skill will know how to adapt these criteria and this invention to other observational methods. Such alternative methods might simultaneously recognize all subsequences of a subsequence set, such as by including a step of simultaneous hybridization of three distinguishably labeled probes to the sample of nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A set of oligonucleotides capable of hybridizing with all additional subsequences that might be present in the subsample, especially when such a set is arrayed on a planar surface, is called herein a &ldquo;universal detection array&rdquo; (&ldquo;UDA&rdquo;). A UDA achieves parallel determination of additional subsequences because all fragments in the subsample hybridize simultaneously to the probes of the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> To achieve preferred separation characteristics, that is to determine subsequences as uniquely as possible, the number of different oligonucleotides in a UDA is important. The number of different oligonucleotides in a UDA necessary to determine an additional subsequence of length &ldquo;L&rdquo; is, of course, 4<highlight><superscript>L</superscript></highlight>, the size of such a UDA. Clearly, such a UDA is capable of recognizing no more than 4<highlight><superscript>L </superscript></highlight>fragments in a subsample. Accordingly, for the preferred separation characteristics previously recited, it is preferred that number of fragments in a subsample be no more than twice the size of the UDA being used. It is more preferable that the number of fragments be less than the size of the UDA, and most preferable that this number be substantially less than the size of the UDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Table 3 combines the results of Table 1 and Table 2 in order to select appropriate UDA sizes and subsequence lengths having preferable resolution and separation for analysis of the expressed human genome, according to the previously assumed complexities. It is assumed that length of S1 is 6 in Table 3. This invention is not limited to the exemplary values and assumptions illustrated in Table 3. Upon reading the following description, one of ordinary skill will understand how to adapt this invention to other values for Table 3 by combining suitably modified Tables 1 and 2, or by other means.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The first column is the row number. The fourth column is the resolution found for the particular subsequence length combination from Table 1. The fifth column is the number of subsample fragments from Table 2. The sixth column is the minimum UDA size appropriate to the length of A1 (that is 4 raised to the power which is the length of A1 ). Line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; is discussed separately below. The seventh column is the ratio of the number of fragments in a subsample, from column four, to the appropriate UDA size, from column five. This seventh column reflects separation characteristics. It is preferably less than 2, more preferably less than 1, and most preferably substantially less than 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Combinations of subsequence lengths and UDA characteristics can be selected according to Table 3. Only the first row is not suitable to this invention because of the inadequate separation characteristics. The third row is preferred because of adequate resolution, adequate separation, and a relatively larger number of fragments expected in each subsample. The fifth row is more preferred because of improved resolution and separation compared to the third row. Accordingly, in the following, this invention is described for embodiments where the lengths of primary subsequences, S1 and S2, are six, the length of the additional subsequence, A1, is five or six, and the UDA size is 1024 or 4096 as appropriate. These embodiments are then adapted to analysis of expressed human nucleic acid samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> This invention is not limited to the minimum UDA sizes of Table 3. A UDA used according to strand-invasion ligation can recognize not only a single-stranded terminal but also a short double-stranded subsequence adjacent to a single-stranded terminal subsequence. Thus, a UDA may be chosen larger than indicated in Table 3. For example, with respect to line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, primary subsequence S1 can be positioned at least one base pair from additional subsequence A1, and a UDA can be used that recognizes 6 bases, 1 base pair of a double-stranded subsequence and 5 bases of a single-stranded terminal subsequence. Line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; illustrates such a configuration with a UDA has a size of 4096 and a separation ratio of 0.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In view of the previous descriptions, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand how to adapt the parameters of these methods, that is how to chose appropriate subsequence lengths and UDA sizes, for nucleic acid samples of differing complexities. For example, different parameters may be appropriate for the analysis of nucleic acid samples from different species and for genomic nucleic acid samples. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The following paragraphs describe exemplary, general applications of the methods and devices of the instant invention. Further applications will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the description and examples in the instant disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Because this invention achieves rapid and economical determination of the quantitative presence of nucleic acids in a complex sample of nucleic acids, it has immediate application to problems relating to the genetic aspects of health and disease in human and other living species. In this application, the sample of nucleic acids is derived from biological sources according to protocols known in the art. For example, nucleic acids samples can include DNA derived from genomic DNA, mitochondrial or other organelle DNA, plasmid DNA, infectious agent DNA, and so forth. Nucleic acid samples can further include RNA derived from total cellular RNA, total cellular mRNA, fractions of mRNA separated from subcellular compartments, infectious agent RNA, and so forth. RNA samples can be advantageously converted into DNA, for example cDNA, by known methods. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds., 1997<highlight><italic>, i Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> These naturally occurring nucleic acid samples can be derived from living sources of all types. The sources may be in vitro cell lines or cell populations, in vivo tissue samples, such as purified cell populations drawn or derived form wild-type occurrences or to tissue samples containing mixed cell populations, and so forth. The cells and tissues can be derived from all taxonomic classes, including viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes, prokaryotes, protista, plants, fungi, and animals of all phyla and classes. The animals can be vertebrates, mammals, primates, and especially humans. In particular, the animals can be laboratory animals used in research, such as mice or rats engineering or bread to have certain genomes or disease conditions or tendencies. The non-human sources can be subject to various exogenous factors, such as agents, stresses, treatments, and so forth, to determine the effect of such factors. Humans sources can derive from clinical trials, pathological specimens, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> These applications can be generally divided into medical applications and research applications. Medical application generally involve examination of known genes of known functions as part of diagnosis or treatment of a patient. Research applications generally involve expression analysis to detect novel genes, novel associations of genes, novel patterns of expression, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In more detail, medical applications are of increasing importance as more and more diseases are recognized to have important genetic components to their etiology and development. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly useful to be able to assay the genetic makeup and expression of a tissue sample. For example, the presence and expression of certain genes or their particular alleles can be prognostic or risk factors for disease (including disorders). Several examples of such diseases are found among the neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson&apos;s disease, Huntington&apos;s disease and ataxia-telangiectasia. The origin or progression of several cancers, such as neuroblastoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell malignancies, breast and ovarian cancer, and melanoma can now be linked to specific genetic defects (oncogenes and tumor suppressors being now widely known in the art). Finally, gene expression can also determine the presence and classification of foreign pathogens, especially those that might be difficult or impossible to culture in vitro but which nevertheless express their own unique genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> To observe one or a few expressed, known genomic sequences of interest, primary subsequences are chosen, as described hereinbelow, to generate fragments from the sequences of interest in one of more subsamples, while minimizing fragments generated from sequence not of interest. Then, the additional subsequences distinguishing the sequences of interest are observed. When a UDA is used, hybridization of fragments to oligomers recognizing these additional subsequences is indicative of the presence of the expressed sequence of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Disease progression is reflected in changes in genetic expression of an affected tissue. For example, expression of particular tumor promoter genes and lack of expression of particular tumor suppressor genes is now known to correlate with the progression of certain tumors from normal tissue, to hyperplasia, to cancer in situ, and to metastatic cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Return of a cell population to a normal pattern of gene expression, such as by using antisense technology, can correlate with tumor regression. Therefore, knowledge of gene expression in a cancerous tissue can assist in staging and classifying this disease. In this application, this invention is used to compare broadly the expression of genomic sequences in two tissue sources at e.g., two different stages of disease progression or before and after a treatment. Therefore, primary subsequences are chosen, as described hereinbelow, to have the greatest coverage, i.e., that a substantial fraction of all nucleic acids that can be expressed will produce at least one fragment in at least one subsample. Additional subsequences are then determined in the subsamples by quantitative observations. Sequence sets having statistically different presence (as described below) in the two tissue sources are of interest as indicating possible differential gene expression in the two states or stages. When a UDA is used with a planar array of nucleotides producing visual hybridization signals, direct comparison of the optical patterns produced by hybridization with the two sources can identify oligomers with significantly different hybridization signals. Such oligomers recognize additional subsequences for sequence sets with different expression. Further, where the fragments from the tissue sources are distinguishable, differential comparison can be done by simultaneous hybridization of samples from both sources on one UDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Expression information can also be used to choose and guide therapy (&ldquo;pharmacogenomics&rdquo;). Accurate disease classification and staging or grading using gene expression information can assist in choosing initial therapies that are increasingly more tailored to the precise disease process occurring in the particular patient. Gene expression information can then track disease progression or regression, and such information can assist in monitoring the success or changing the course of an initial therapy. A therapy is favored that results in a regression towards normal or an abnormal pattern of gene expression in an individual, while therapy which has little effect on gene expression or its progression can need modification. Such monitoring is now useful for cancers and will become useful for an increasing number of other diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Finally, in the case of direct gene therapy, expression analysis directly monitors the success of treatment. Expression differences in samples from tissue sources at different times, subject to different treatments, and so forth are assayed according to this invention as just described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> This invention is also applicable to samples of genomic DNA in a manner similar to its application to cDNA. Medical information of interest in genomic DNA samples includes occurrence and identity of translocations, gene amplifications, loss of heterozygosity for an allele, etc. This information is of interest in, for example, cancer diagnosis and staging or molecular genotyping to predict disease susceptibility and predisposition. In cancer patients, amplified sequences might reflect an oncogene, while loss of heterozygosity might reflect a tumor suppressor gene. Such sequences of interest can be used to select subsequence sets for recognizing the particular genomic changes. Even without prior knowledge of the sequences of interest, detection and classification of patterns of nucleic acid expression is useful for the comparison of normal and diseased states or for observing the progression of a disease state. Gene expression information concerning the progression of a disease state is useful in order to elucidate the genetic mechanisms behind disease, to find useful diagnostic markers, to guide the selection and observe the results of therapies, etc. Differences in the sequence sets observed identify the gene or genes involved, whether known or novel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In biological research, rapid and economical assay for gene expression in tissue or other samples has numerous applications. Such applications include, but are not limited to, for example, in pathology examining tissue specific genetic response to disease, in embryology determining developmental changes in gene expression, in pharmacology assessing direct and indirect effects of drugs on gene expression. Further, since an unknown sequence set pattern is indicative of an as yet unknown gene, this invention has important use for the discovery of new genes. Additionally, comparative gene-expression information can simplify discovery of detailed disease mechanisms. In medical research, by way of further example, use of the methods of this invention allow correlating gene expression with the presence and progress of a disease and thereby provide new methods of diagnosis and new avenues of therapy which seek to directly alter gene expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In more detail, in these applications gene-expression differences between tissue sources from carefully controlled and similar states are assayed as previously described. Importantly, the controlled states are chosen to reduce the complexity of observed changes, preferably such that only a small percentage of the observed sequence sets have changed expression. This small percentage is preferably less than 5% or 1%, and more preferably less than 0.5%. These assays identify sequence sets with different quantitative expression by, perhaps, direct observation of visual hybridization signals from a UDA. The carefully controlled tissue sources can arise from many comparisons. For example, certain cardiovascular tissues can be from a normal laboratory animal and from a similar animal challenged by induced hypertension. Certain immune system tissues can be from a normal animal and from a similar animal challenged with, e.g., bacterial endotoxins. Hepatic tissues can be from a normal laboratory animal and one challenged with a drug or toxin. Tissues can be drawn from embryos at various stages and locations. Cell cultures and cell lines can also be sample sources. For example, samples can be derived from a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; cell culture and from the same cell culture subject to such factors as growth factors, signaling moieties, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Classification of observed subsequence set patterns, in an exemplary embodiment, can involve statistical analysis to determine significant differences between patterns of interest. This can involve first grouping samples that are similar in one or more characteristics, such characteristics including, for example, epidemiological history, histopathological state, treatment history, etc. Quantitative sequence set observations from similar samples are then compared, e.g., by finding the average and standard deviation of each individual observations. Individual sequence set observations which are of limited variability, e.g., for which the standard deviation is less than the average, then represent genetic constants of samples of this particular characteristic. Such limited variability observations from one set of tissue samples can then be compared to limited variability observations from another set of tissue samples. Sequence set observations which differ in this comparison then represent differences in the genetic expression between the tissue samples and are of interest in reflecting the biological differences between the samples, such as the differences caused by the progression of a disease. Differences in expression are detected, e.g., when the difference in the genetic expression between two tissues exceed the sum of the standard deviation of the expressions in the tissues. Other standard statistical comparisons as are known in the art can also be used to establish levels of expression and the significance of differences in levels of expressions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.1.1 Generation of Subsamples </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The preferred observational method for determining or recognizing a subsequence set in a sample nucleic acid is comprised of two principal steps. In a first step, one or more subsamples are created from the original sample such that the nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments in each subsample have particular, selected primary subsequences, S1 and S2. In a second step, an additional subsequence, A1, is determined in each fragment of a subsample, such that A1 is between S1 and S2 and in a fixed relation to S1. Preferably, A1 is adjacent to S1. This subsection describes methods for the first of the two steps of the preferred observational method, and the following subsection describes methods for the second step. For illustrative purposes and without limitation, this description is directed to the preferred implementation where the lengths of S1 and S2 are 6 bps and the length of A1 is 5 to 9 bps, and where the nucleic acids being analyzed are dsDNA. Alternative implementations for recognizing the preferred or alternative sequence set structures are discussed at the end of each section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Preliminary to description of the first step of the preferred observational method, the important property of coverage of an observational method is next described. Coverage of a particular observational method is taken herein to mean how adequately nucleic acids of interest in the original sample are sampled, or observed, by the observational method. In the case of the preferred method, coverage is determined by the selection of the particular nucleotide subsequences of the primary subsequences which define the plurality of subsamples. Various criteria can be used to guide this selection. For example, in the case where the expression of certain nucleic acids, or known genes, is of interest and is to be measured, a set of particular nucleotide sequences can be selected with respect to such known sequences in order that each nucleic acid of interest will produce at least one fragment in at least one subsample. Preferably, also, the set of subsequences can be selected to minimize fragments produced from nucleic acids in the sample that are not of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Alternately, in the case where the expression of a substantial fraction of nucleic acids, or expressed genes, in a sample are to be measured, a sufficient number of particular nucleotide sequences can be selected so that a substantial fraction of nucleic acids in the original sample produce at least one fragment in at least one subsample. For example, it is preferable that the fraction of nucleic acids sampled should exceed 50%, more preferably 75%, and even more preferably 90%. The fraction sampled can be estimated for a particular selected set of nucleotide subsequences by computer means. For example, such means can scan nucleotide sequences stored in a database of nucleic acid sequences likely to be present in the sample for the presence of pairs of subsequences from the selected set of nucleotide sequences, and then can count the percentage of nucleic acids in the database that have pairs of selected nucleotide sequences. Such nucleic acids generate at least one fragment in at least one subsample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> presents exemplary output from such computer means for estimating coverage. Here, the particular nucleotide sequences for the primary subsequences were selected from the recognition sequences of Type II REs with 6 bp recognition sites. The vertical axis in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> indicates the percent of the database sequences generating at least one fragment in at least one subsample, which is defined here by a pair of Type II REs. The horizontal axis indicates number of RE pair, or particular primary subsequence pairs, each pair representing one subsample. The results graphed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrate that it is possible to achieve 50%, 75%, 90%, or more coverage by recognizing primary subsequences using restriction endonucleases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The original nucleic acid sample to which the first step of the observational method is applied may derive from any natural or artificial source of nucleic acids. For example, the sample may derive from chromosomal or extra-chromosomal DNA. Chromosomal DNA may be structural genes, regulatory regions, coding regions, non-coding regions, repeated regions, and so forth. In the case of chromosomal DNA an optional fragmentation step can be by, e.g., shearing or sonication (Favello, et al., Methods Cell Biol. 48:551-569 (1995)). Extra-chromosomal DNA may derive from mitochondria, viruses, other parasites or pathogens, plasmids, synthetic constructs, and so forth. RNA samples may include rRNA, tRNA, total cellular mRNA, poly(A) mRNA, specific cellular mRNA fractions, viral RNA, and so forth. As is well known in the art, RNA, in particular mRNA, is advantageously converted for analysis into double-stranded cDNA by methods which are now routine (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. 97/15690, Gubler et al., Gene 25:263-269 2 (1983), or commercially available kits such as SUPERSCRIPT (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the preferred observational method, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates methods for the first step, which are described in this subsection as applied to an exemplary nucleic acid. Here, dsDNA <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a nucleic acid in an original sample of double stranded nucleic acids, is input to the first step. Certain aspects of the structure of dsDNA <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are to be determined by the observational methods, namely, in this step, selection of nucleic acids having primary subsequences <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> with particular and predetermined nucleotide sequences, and in the next step determination of additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in the selected nucleic acids. As is preferred, additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is illustrated adjacent to primary subsequence <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, additional subsequence can be spaced from primary subsequence <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> by a number of nucleotides which is fixed in a subsample (but can vary between subsamples). The first step produces a subsample of nucleic acid fragments, such as nucleic acid <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, derived from nucleic acid <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and having a structure adapted for determination of additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> This first step may employ any method by which nucleic acid <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, having determined primary subsequences and adapted to determination of the additional subsequence, can be derived from nucleic acid <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. For example, primary subsequence <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> can be recognized by DNA binding proteins of all types, by hybridization with oligo-deoxynucleotides or oligo-deoxynucleotide mimics, and so forth. In a preferred embodiment, this first step utilizes Type II REs to recognize primary subsequences <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, and generates various intermediates, including intermediate nucleic acid <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. In the following, this preferred embodiment, including certain variations, is described, followed by a summary of certain alternative embodiments. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the RE recognition sites or subsequences thereof are identified by diagonal indicia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment proceeds by a series of conventional processing steps the details of whose protocols are well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 97/15690 (in particular Sections 5.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.10, 6.11); U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,245; U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,877; Ausubel et al., eds., 1997<highlight><italic>, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York; Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual</italic></highlight>, Cold Spring Harbor Press, (2nd. ed., 1989); <highlight><italic>New England Biolabs </italic></highlight>96/97 <highlight><italic>Catalog</italic></highlight>, New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass. (1996), all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Preliminary to the steps illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an input sample of dsDNA nucleic acids is dephosphorylated by an alkaline phosphatase such as, e.g., Barents Sea shrimp alkaline phosphatase. Next, the dephosphorylated sample is divided into separate batches, one batch for each pair of selected nucleotide sequences from the set of selected nucleotide sequences, and each batch is separately processed into subsamples according to the following further steps that are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> First, each batch is processed in a combined RE-digestion/adapter-ligation reaction. Reaction conditions include sufficient amounts of the Type II REs, recognizing the pair of selected nucleotide sequences, and appropriate buffers such that sample nucleic acids <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are substantially completely digested into fragments <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. Digested fragment <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> has single-stranded overhang <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, comprising a portion of the RE recognition site <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> remaining after digestion, and single-stranded overhang <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, similarly derived from recognition site <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> so present in the RE digestion/ligation reaction are molar excesses of adapters <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, which are hybridizable with single-stranded overhangs <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, respectively, resulting from RE digestion, and a ligase, such as T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> DNA ligase. The adapters comprise linker strands <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> having 5&prime;-ends complementary to overhangs <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, respectively, and primer strands <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> hybridizable with the 3&prime;-ends of linkers <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, respectively. The primers typically have of length of 18 to 30 nucleotides, most preferably a length of approximately 24 bases, and have a sequence which does not recreate an RE recognition site upon ligation, in order that their ligation terminates further RE digestion. In addition, primer strand <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the adapter hybridizable with the end of fragment <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, which is in a fixed relation to additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, is labeled with, e.g., radioactive, enzymatic, or preferably, fluorescent means <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, such as the fluorophore FAM (Catalog &num; C-1311, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). Primer strand <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> of the adapter hybridizable with the other end of fragment <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> (not in a fixed relation to the additional subsequence) is linked to binding moiety <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> such as, e.g., a hapten, preferably biotin. Preferably, linkers <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> have a length of 8 to 16 nucleotides, and most preferably 12 nucleotides, and have no terminal phosphates, in order to prevent self-ligation. Activity of the ligase on fragment <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> with hybridized adapters ligates primer strains <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> to the respective ends of fragment <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and creates fragment <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. Alternately the RE digestion and ligation steps can be done sequentially. Detailed conditions for carrying out such digestion/ligation reactions, including necessary buffer conditions as well as precise prescriptions for designing the adapters, in order that substantially all input nucleic acids <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are converted into fragments <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> are well known in the art (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. 97/15690) or available from manufacturer&apos;s specifications (<highlight><italic>New England Biolabs </italic></highlight>96/97 <highlight><italic>Catalog</italic></highlight>, New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass. (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In a preferred second processing step, the results of the RE digestion/ligation reactions are processed by PCR amplification in a standard manner (or by other amplification means), thereby creating an amplified subsample with nucleic acid fragments having the structure of fragment <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. Sufficient cycles of PCR amplification are performed so that final fragments <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> have sufficient concentrations to be detected by whatever detection means are utilized. Alternatively, where subsequent detection means are sufficiently sensitive, this amplification step can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In detail, fragment <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> includes subsequences <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, which are the remaining portions of the RE recognition sites <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, respectively, and additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> adjacent to subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Terminal to subsequences <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, are subsequences having the sequence of primer strands <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, respectively. Therefore, either primer sequences <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, or a similarly labeled, hybridizable portion of sequences <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, can be used as PCR primers. Prior to PCR amplification, the ligated products are blunt-ended by contacting them with a DNA polymerase and dNTPs in appropriate polymerization conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> PCR amplification protocols used in this invention are preferably optimized for specificity and reproducibility according to methods known in the art. See, e.g., Innis et al. eds., <highlight><italic>PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications</italic></highlight>, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). For example, to achieve increased amplification specificity, amplification primers are preferably designed by to have a high Tm, preferably above 55&deg; C. and more preferably above approximately 68&deg; C. Primers are further designed not to hybridize with any native fragment species in the subsamples to be analyzed. Primer mis-hybridizations, and consequent spurious amplification products, are minimized by performing all amplification steps at a temperature near, at, or above the Tm of the primer. In particular, high annealing temperatures (no more that 1-5&deg; C. less than the primer Tm) minimize primer mis-hybridizations. (In the following, the temperature Tm, or the &ldquo;melting temperature,&rdquo; is the temperature at which half of a species of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules are denatured into single-stranded nucleic acid molecules.) Finally, longer extension and melting times reduce PCR bias related to smaller fragments and high G&plus;C content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> PCR amplification amplifies only those fragments that have been doubly digested by the REs. Only such fragments have sequences complementary to primers on both ends, and only such fragments will therefore exponentially amplify. Alternately, one primer (not having the Type IIS site) can have a conjugated biotin to aid in removal of correctly digested reaction products from the other reaction products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The adapters <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> have additional structure, in particular Type IIS RE recognition subsequence <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which is adapted to the determination of additional subsequence A1. Also, the adapter without the Type IIS site preferably has a conjugated capture moiety, such as biotin, so that fragments cut by a Type IIS RE can be cleanly separated. This structure is described in the next section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment, the length of the primary subsequences <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> can be one, two, or more nucleotides longer than RE recognition sites (with a corresponding displacement of additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) by the use of phasing primers in the optional PCR amplification step. Phasing PCR primers for a fragment with a known terminal subsequence and an unknown central subsequence are herein taken to mean primers hybridizable with both the known terminal subsequence and with one, two, or more nucleotides (referred to herein as &ldquo;phasing nucleotides&rdquo;) of the unknown central subsequence adjacent to the known terminal subsequence. Such primers are well known in the art. See, e.g., European Patent Application 534,858 A1. By the separate use of four phasing primers with a specified additional, overlapping nucleotide, pre-determined primary subsequences of length seven (where the RE recognition site was of length six) can be recognized in four sub-subsamples. Primary subsequences of length eight, nine, and more can be similarly recognized in 16, 64, or more sub-samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> This invention is adaptable to other methods of generating subsamples having the structure of fragment <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. Several such methods are known to those of ordinary skill. According to one such exemplary method (Prashar et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 93:659-663), cDNA is synthesized using a first-strand phasing primer with an oligo(dT) core, a number, e.g., two, of phasing nucleotides at the 3&prime;-end, and a special &ldquo;heel&rdquo; subsequence at the 5&prime;-end. After digestion of the cDNA with a Type II RE, a partially double stranded Y-adapter is hybridized and ligated onto the single-stranded overhangs of digested fragments. This Y-adaptor has a non-complementary region including a 5&prime;-primer sequence. Finally, a pool of final fragments is produced by a PCR amplification of the ligated-digested fragments using a first primer, having the heel primer sequence, and a second primer, having the 5&prime;-primer sequence. This method produces subsamples of fragments derived from nucleic acids having two known subsequences, one of which is the recognition site of the Type II RE and the other of which is a subsequence of one or more nucleotides adjacent to the poly(A) tail of mRNAs. The Y-adaptor or the &ldquo;heel&rdquo; can be adapted to contain a Type IIS recognition site in order to recognize an additional subsequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> According to another exemplary method (U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,937), cDNAs are synthesized from natural sources using a first-strand phasing primer with an oligo(dT) core, a number of phasing nucleotides, and a recognition site for a rare-cutting Type II RE. The resulting cDNAs are then digested by the rare-cutting RE and another more frequently-cutting Type II RE. Doubly-digested fragments are ligated in an anti-sense orientation into a cloning vector, which is then used to synthesize cRNA. Further, cDNA is synthesized from this cRNA using first-strand primers having sequences corresponding to the portion of the cloning vector adjacent to the 3&prime;-end of each insert and further phasing nucleotides. Finally, the resulting products are PCR amplified using primers comprising adjacent portions of the cloning vectors on both sides of the insert, one of these primers having additional phasing nucleotides. Thereby, by using multiple sets of phasing primers, this method generates final cDNA subsamples derived from mRNA having two known subsequences, one of which comprises a Type II RE recognition site extended by a certain number of nucleotides, and another of which is a subsequence adjacent to the poly(A) tail. Either final primer can be adapted to contain a Type IIS recognition site in order to recognize an additional subsequence. See, also, European Patent Application 534,858 A1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> According to further alternatives, the subsamples can be created by PCR amplification with primers recognizing the primary subsequences. Alternatively, the primary subsequences can be recognized by chemical cleavage, using such chemicals as neocarzinostatin (Gao et al., Biochemistry 34:40-49 (1995)), C1027 (Xu et al., Biochemistry 33:5947-5954 (1994)), or calicheamicin (Dedon et al., Biochemistry 32:3617-3622 (1993)). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.1.2 Determination of Additional Subsequence </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The second step of the two step observational method determines additional subsequence A1. This subsequence may be determined according to any procedure. For example, a less preferred procedure uses a plurality of phasing primers in a plurality of PCR reactions. Production of PCR product in any PCR reaction then signifies presence of the additional phasing nucleotides recognized by that phasing PCR primer. The additional subsequence is constructed from the phasing nucleotides so recognized. The multiple PCR amplifications necessary here can be advantageously performed by a laboratory robot. This less preferred alternative is adaptable to an additional subsequence of any length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> However, as previously described, it is preferable to use a procedure which recognizes all the additional subsequences in a subsample in a simultaneous, parallel, and quantitative manner. One preferred method uses a universal detection array (&ldquo;UDA&rdquo;) in conjunction with a Type IIS RE, which is used to generate a &ldquo;handle,&rdquo; or single-stranded overhang, for hybridization to the oligomers of a UDA. According to this preferred method, then, the additional subsequence includes the nucleotide sequence of the overhang produced by digestion of a nucleic acid having the structure of fragment <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> with a Type IIS RE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Prior to description of this preferred method, the capabilities of a preferred implementation of a UDA are briefly reviewed. This implementation is described in detail in Section 5.2. A UDA is a simple high throughput device for accurately recognizing short terminal subsequences. Using hybridization/ligation (Section 5.2.3) a UDA recognizes single-stranded terminal subsequences. Using strand-invasion hybridization (Section 5.2.4), a UDA can also recognize short double-stranded subsequences adjacent to single-stranded terminal subsequences. Since a UDA contains all oligomers of a given length, it is therefore capable of recognizing in parallel all subsequences of that length with a single hybridization. No cumbersome cloning, sequencing reactions, and electrophoretic separation are necessary. By hybridization with a plurality of distinguishably labeled subsamples, a single UDA can simultaneously recognize subsequences in this plurality of subsamples. By adjustment of subsample nucleic acid concentration and UDA oligomer density, a UDA is capable of returning information on the quantitative amount of recognized subsequence present in a sample. Finally, various optional but preferred oligomer placement structures (error checking regions) and methods (stacking oligomers) result in highly-specific signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred method, the Type IIS enzyme generates the single-stranded terminus, or &ldquo;handle,&rdquo; necessary for a UDA. In more detail, a Type IIS RE cuts the dsDNA strands at a location displaced from the recognition site generating a single-stranded terminus, or overhang. It is preferable to use Type IIS REs of high specificity which generate a single-stranded terminus of at least 4 bps displaced at least 5 bp from the recognition site. The at least 5 bp displacement is preferable in order to cut beyond the portion of the 6 bp Type II RE recognition site remaining on the nucleic acid fragments. Type IIS REs adaptable to this invention include: BbvI, which generates a 4 bp overhang displaced 8 bp from the recognition site; FokI, which generates a 4 bp overhang displaced 9 bp; HgaI, which generates a 5 bp overhang displaced 5 bp; and CjeI, which generates two 6 bp overhangs displaced 8 or 9 bp in both directions from the recognition site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In more detail, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, type IIS recognition subsequence <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is present on fluorescently labeled adapter <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. For each particular Type IIS RE, subsequence <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is positioned in view of the length of the Type II RE recognition site <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (typically 6 bp), the position of the Type II cut within subsequence <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (for Type II REs generating 4 bp overhangs, the remaining portion, subsequence <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, of the recognition site remaining on fragment <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is 5 bp in length), and the displacement between the Type IIS recognition site and cutting sites. Details of determining the exact placement of Type IIS recognition site <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> on adapter <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are known in the prior art (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. 97/15690). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As illustrated by fragment <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, in case recognition site <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is positioned so that Type IIS overhang <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is adjacent to subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, the remaining portion of the Type II recognition site, then additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is the sequence of this overhang. A UDA used according to hybridization/ligation can recognize additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> as the sequence of overhang <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a UDA used according to strand-invasion hybridization can recognize both additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> as the sequence of overhang <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> as well as confirming one or more nucleotides of the known subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as illustrated by fragment <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, in case recognition site <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is positioned so that Type IIS overhang <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is spaced apart from subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> by short double-stranded subsequence <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, then additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is the sequence of single-stranded overhang <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> joined to that of double-stranded subsequence <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. A UDA is then used according to strand-invasion hybridization in order to recognize this entire additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Also, optionally, one or more nucleotides of the known subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> can be confirmed. Less preferably, the UDA is used according to hybridization/ligation and double-stranded sequence <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is ignored. Here in this less preferred case, there is a fixed gap between primary subsequence <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> It is much less preferred to place the Type IIS recognition site so that the Type IIS RE cuts within the Type II recognition site. In this case the Type IIS overhang merely recreates part or all of the original Type II overhang. Thereby, the additional subsequence is shorter and the resulting subsequence set has less resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> For example, Type IIS RE FokI generates a 4 bp overhang displaced 9 bp from the recognition site. If its recognition subsequence <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is placed 4 bp from the end of strand <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, then, since sequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is 5 bp for a Type II RE generating a 4 bp overhang within a 6 bp recognition site, a fragment of type <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is generated with FokI overhang subsequence <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> adjacent to subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In this case additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is 4 bp. Alternatively, if subsequence <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is placed 3, 2, or 1 bp from the end of strand <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, a fragment of type <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> is generated with double-stranded subsequence of length 1, 2, or 3 bps, respectively. In this case additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is 5, 6, or 7 bps, respectively. Thereby, FokI is capable of generating &ldquo;handles&rdquo; for additional subsequences of length 4-7 bps, which are recognized by a UDA used according to strand-invasion ligation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In view of the previous, the second step receives a subsample of fragments generated with selected adapters <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and then digests them with a selected Type IIS RE. Reaction conditions are chosen as is known in the prior art or according to manufacturer&apos;s recommendations in order to achieve complete digestion. See, e.g., PCT Publication No. 97/15690, or <highlight><italic>New England Biolabs </italic></highlight>96/97 <highlight><italic>Catalog</italic></highlight>, New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass. (1996). After digestion, the reaction products are contacted to an immobilized capture moiety, such as, e.g., streptavidin coated beads, that can bind binding moiety label <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, such as, e.g., biotin, and the contacted beads are washed. Thereby, the short digested fragments <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> are separated into the supernatant and the longer fragments not of interest are retained bound to the beads. These length of fragments <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, that is the length of subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> plus the length of primer <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, is typically from 17 to 35 nucleotides, and preferably approximately 29 nucleotides. Fragments <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> are labeled with, e.g., fluorescent moiety <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and are ready for additional subsequence determination with, e.g., a UDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the nucleotide sequence of additional sequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be determined by any procedure known in the art. A less preferred alternative method for identifying this sequence from fragments <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> is to use such sequencing methods as Sanger sequencing reactions followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. These alternative methods may also include a cloning step. Other methods involve determining the additional subsequence as the sequence of a single-stranded overhang generated by careful digestion with a exonuclease that preferentially digests a single strand of a double-stranded nucleic acid. T4 DNA polymerase has such exonuclease activity in the absence of dNTPs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Embodiments Utilizing Mass Spectroscopy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> A more preferred alternative method of determining additional nucleotide sequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, as well as alternative embodiments of the previous steps of this method, depend on mass spectroscopy (&ldquo;MS&rdquo;). MS alone can determine the sequence of fragments such as <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, without the need for hybridization or other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As is known to one of ordinary skill in the art, identification of nucleotide sequences of nucleic acid fragments by MS depends on mass determination of the nucleic acid fragments with sufficient accuracy so that each base can be recognized by its unique mass. See, e.g., Fitzgerald et al., Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 7: 895-897 (1993). A mass accuracy achieved has been reported to be typically better than 0.1%. See, e.g., Bentley et al., Anal. Chem. 68:2141-2146 (1996). Recently, MS methods of improved resolution and sensitivity and applicable to complex mixtures of oligonucleotides have been developed. These are based on a variation of the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight method (&ldquo;MALDI-TOF&rdquo;) using delayed ion extraction (&ldquo;DE-MALDI&rdquo;). See, e.g., Roskey et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4724-4729 (1996), which reports that by coupling a high yield cycle sequencing protocol to DE-MALDI, sequencing of dideoxy-terminated DNA mixtures of templates up to 40 or 50 bases long was achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in one alternative implementation, the sequence of fragments <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, and thus additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, are determined using appropriate MS methods. For example, since these fragments are typically less than 40 nucleotides, the DE-MALDI method reported by Roskey et al. may be directly applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> An improvement to the previous alternative involves a further digestion of fragments <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> by a Type II RE. This improvement can dramatically improve resolution and specificity of subsequent MS sequence determination by removing unnecessary known sequence from the fragment to be sequenced. Subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of these fragments typically consists of 5 bp out of the 6 bp palindromic recognition site of the Type II REs recognizing primary subsequences <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Therefore, subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> typically contains a 4 bp palindromic sub-subsequence that can be cleaved by a Type II RE recognizing such a 4 bp subsequence. In fact, Type II REs are commercially available that recognize all 4 bp palindromic sequences other than the sequences ATAT, TATA, and TGCA. Cleavage of fragments <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> with such a Type II RE produces larger sub-fragments of known sequence, which are not of interest, as well as sub-shorter fragments containing additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, which are of interest. Since these shorter sub-fragments have at most 5 bp of known sequence linked to unknown additional sequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, MS determination of their sequence is much more sensitive. Therefore, instead of approximately 25 bp of known sequence, the shorter sub-fragments have only approximately 5 bp known sequence forming the background for the MS mass, and therefore sequence, determination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In brief, this alternative proceeds by further digesting fragments <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> with Type II REs that cleave within sequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The short fragments of interest are separated from the long fragments not of interest by, e.g., reverse phase HPLC. The separated short fragments can then be directly sequenced by any appropriate MS method, for example by DE-MALDI. Thereby, additional sequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of this invention utilizes mass spectrometry to determine the sequences of fragments produced by those unique REs that cut on both sides of their recognition site, directly producing short nucleic acid fragments from a nucleic acid in the original sample. Such REs include BcgI and CjeI which produce 34 bp fragments, and BaeI and CjePI, which produce 33 bp fragments. An input sample is digested by such an enzyme under conditions, according to manufacturer recommendation or as known in the art, for substantially complete digestion. The short cut fragments of appropriate length are isolated by any separations method, preferably, HPLC or denaturing gel electrophoresis. These sequences of these short fragments can be directly determined by MS according to the DE-MALDI method. Finally, the sequences for 33-34 bp fragments of nucleic acids in the sample can be directly used by known sequence database search tools to identify nucleic acids present in the input sample that could be a source for such fragments. For example, sequences in a sequence database can be directly searched for the identified substrings, or alternatively, homology search tools, such as, e.g., BLASTN, can be used. As is known in the art, a fragment of such a length will in most cases uniquely identify a source nucleic acid in the database. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.1.3 Database Search </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> This subsection describes the third step of the gene-calling methods of the instant invention. The previous two method steps, that is the step of generating a subsample of fragments from those nucleic acids of the original sample having two specified primary subsequences and the step of determining an additional subsequence in the nucleic acid fragments of the subsample, have observed that certain subsequence sets, which are defined by the primary subsequences and the additional subsequence, are present in nucleic acids of the original sample. This third step searches a database of nucleic acid sequences which are likely to be present in the original sample for sequences having the observed subsequence sets. In the following, this section generally describes, first, nucleic acids databases useable in this invention, next, relevant data processing techniques which this step utilizes, then, methods for producing a database of sequences likely to be present in the sample, and last, methods for searching such a database to find sequences having particular sequence sets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Numerous nucleic acid sequence databases are known in the art. Such databases include the &ldquo;official&rdquo; databases, whose goal is to make substantially all known nucleic acid sequences publicly available from only a few sources. The official databases include GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, Md.) (Benson et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25(1): 1-6 (1997)), the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, (European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom) (Stoesser et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25(1):7-13 (1997)), and the DNA Databank of Japan (National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan) (Tateno et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25(1):14-17 (1997)). Such databases attempt to collect at least all published nucleic acid sequences into a standardized representation. They typically make this collection available in periodic releases (entire copies as of a certain date) available on CD-ROM or other media, and are accessible over the Internet for download or search. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Other databases are also known to those of skill in the art and are publicly available. Such database includes those directed to particular organisms, those directed to mutations associated with particular genes or linked to particular diseases, and so forth. Databases directed to particular organisms include, for example, the MIPS database with the complete genome of <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>(Mewes et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25(1):28-30 (1997)), the FlyBase database with sequences of <highlight><italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic></highlight>(The FlyBase Consortium, Nuc. Acids Res. 25(1):63-66 (1997)), various databases with complete or partial microbial genomes (see, e.g., The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, Md., and at http://www.tigr.org), and so forth, Databases directed to particular mutations and diseases include, for example, those with Factor VIII mutations (Kemball-Cook et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25(1):128-132 (1997)), with p53 and APC mutations (Beroud et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25(1):128 (1997)), with Marfan disease related mutations in the FBN1 gene (Collod-Beroud et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25(1):147-150 (1997)), and so forth. A comprehensive review of nucleic acid sequence databases can be found in the Jan. 1, 1997, issue of Nucleic Acid Research (vol. 25, no. 1) and preceding annual database issues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The methods of this subsection are adapted to the general structure adopted by the &ldquo;official&rdquo; sequence databases. See, e.g., <highlight><italic>EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database User Manual, </italic></highlight>European Bioinformatics Institutes, Hinxton, United Kingdom (Release 51, 1997); <highlight><italic>NCBI-GenBank Flat File Release </italic></highlight>102.0 <highlight><italic>Distribution CD-ROM Release Notes, </italic></highlight>National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, Md. (1997). This general structure includes separation of the database into &ldquo;divisions,&rdquo; each division containing a large number of &ldquo;sequence entries.&rdquo; Each division generally groups sequence entries of similar taxonomic derivation. For example, GenBank has divisions containing sequence entries from primates, rodents, other mammals, other vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, bacteria, viruses, phages, along with several EST (&ldquo;expressed sequence tags&rdquo;) divisions. (The EST divisions are separated because of the particular characteristics of EST sequences). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In a preferred (flat file) embodiment, each division is represented as a plurality of sequence entries, each entry being a plurality of structured data lines of text in ASCII characters. Each GenBank division is distributed as a separate flat file, which in this representation is therefore a flat text file. Each data line has data of a particular type, which is identified by keywords or key symbols placed at fixed positions in each data line. Most data types include parameters identifying a sequence entry, including, for example, the accession number of the entry, origin species of the entry, taxonomy of the origin species, biological type of this sequence, biological features of the sequence, literature references relating to this sequence, and so forth. One data type is reserved for the nucleotide sequence data lines. A special key symbol (for GenBank, &ldquo;//&rdquo;) marks special lines dividing separate sequence entries. The biological type parameter distinguishes the biological function of the sequence, such as DNA (genomic sequences), mRNA (expressed sequences), structural RNAs, etc. The sequence features parameter typically can include the coding domain sequence (&ldquo;CDS&rdquo;) (as a character string or as an indication of the position of the CDS in the sequence data), positions of introns, position of exons, positions of any STS markers, and so forth. Sequence databases can optionally include indexes permitting retrieval of entries based on entry content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, in a preferred embodiment, the methods of the database searching step can be implemented using computer techniques relating to text or string processing and parsing. For example, since GenBank flat files consist of entries with structured data lines identified by tokens (that is, keywords) of text and in particular, in which the sequence data appears in the form of character strings of the letters A, C, G, and T (representing nucleotides), the methods of this invention require recognizing tokens in sequence entry data lines, in order to identify sequence entries of interest, and recognizing patterns of subsequences in sequence data strings, in order to recognize sequence sets in sequence data strings. Both these tasks are cases of the general problem of recognizing regular expressions in strings. Regular expressions are well known in the computer arts. A definition can be found in, e.g., Sedgewick, <highlight><italic>Algorithms in C, </italic></highlight>Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, Mass. (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, especially chapter 20. Given a specification of a regular expression, it is also well known in the computer arts how to routinely and simply create a program for recognizing such an expression in strings. See, e.g., Id.; Aho et al., <highlight><italic>Compilers Principles, Techniques, and Tools, </italic></highlight>Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, Mass. (1986), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, especially chapter 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> These string processing techniques have been implemented in numerous, publicly available, regular expression recognition and parsing tools are already, as is known to one of ordinary skill. These tools can be adapted to alternative embodiments of this invention. Such tools include, for example, system utilities such as the UNIX utility &ldquo;grep,&rdquo; which can recognize an input regular expression in an input string. Many word or text processing programs accept regular expressions for searching retrieved text. Special languages are available which include built-in regular expression recognition and parsing, such as the language Perl. See, e.g., Wall et al., <highlight><italic>Programming Perl, </italic></highlight>O&apos;Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc., Sebastopol, Calif. (1992). Perl includes a syntax for specifying regular expressions and a run-time engine for recognizing regular expressions in text strings. Finally, regular expression algorithms known in the art, such as those disclosed in Sedgewick or Aho et al., can be implemented in general purpose programming languages, e.g., C or C&plus;&plus;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, sequence databases are stored in a database system according to particular data model, e.g., in a relational database system such as SYBASE from Sybase, Inc. (Emeryville, Calif.) or the systems available from the Oracle Corporation. According to this embodiment, sequence data strings for nucleotide sequences of, for example, selected origin species and selected type can be retrieved by SQL queries from the relational database, as is well known in the computer arts. See, e.g., Ullman, <highlight><italic>Principles of Database Systems, </italic></highlight>Computer Science Press, Rockville, Md. (1992); McGovern et al., A Guide to SYBASE and SQL Server, Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, Mass. (1993). These strings can then be subsequently parsed for regular expressions representing observed sequence sets. Alternatively, a sequence database in relational format may be converted into a series of text files, and processed according to the previously described preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Now turning to the specific methods for database searching, in a preferred embodiment these methods include two general steps: a first step which produces a database of sequences likely to be present in an original sample, and a second step which searches this database of sequences likely to be present for those sequences with the particular sequence sets observed in the preceding two steps of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> generally illustrates a preferred embodiment of the database searching step. One input to this step is sequence database <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>, which is represented here in an exemplary manner as a plurality of files, one file for each division. Another input to this step are quantitative observations <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> of sequence sets in the original sample, which are output from the preceding method steps applied to an original sample. The first processing step, selection step <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, selects from sequence database <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> those sequence entries for nucleic acids likely to be present in the original sample and stores these sequences in database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, selection step <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> sequentially (that is, in the order as stored in the database) scans all the sequence entries of the appropriate division or divisions of the sequence database and selects those entries having parameters most closely describing the types of sequences in the sample. Where indexes are present, these can advantageously be searched in order to find directly the particular sequence entries of interest, thereby avoiding sequential search of all sequence entries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In more detail, each sequence entry is fetched, and the keywords describing the data lines are recognized. For data lines with keywords of importance, the parameters describing this entry are recognized, compared to values describing the original nucleic acid sample, and the entry is retained if the values match. For example, in the case of a sample of cDNA from a mouse, entries for the rodent division of can be sequentially searched for an origin species of &ldquo;Mus musculus.&rdquo; Such mouse sequence entries that are further of type &ldquo;mRNA&rdquo; (which is also used for cDNA) or which contain a coding domain sequence (that is have a value for feature &ldquo;CDS&rdquo;) are stored. Alternatively, the EST divisions may also be searched for mouse entries. For a further example, in the case of a sample from a virally infected mouse, the virus division can also be similarly searched for CDS or expressed entries from the infecting virus. Certain sequence entry parameters, such as literature reference parameters, are unlikely to be significant in defining selection criteria Next, sequence search step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> searches sequence strings stored in sequence entries in database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> in order to find those sequence strings containing observed sequence sets <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. As previously discussed, a sequence set is observed only if a nucleic acid in the original sample has the observed first primary subsequence S1, the observed additional subsequence A1 a fixed number, N (determined by the observational method), of nucleotides <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; to S1, and the observed primary subsequence S2 any number of nucleotides <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; to A1. As is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the computer arts, a sequence set defines a regular expression which can be used to search strings representing nucleic acid sequences for occurrences of the sequence set. As an example, and without limitation, in the notation of Perl, a regular expression representing a sequence set is denoted by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>$s1&lsqb;A,C,T,G&rsqb;&lcub;N&rcub;$a1&lsqb;A,C,T,G&rsqb;* $s2&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> (blanks present for clarity only) where $s1 ($s2) is a scalar variable having a value which is the nucleotide sequence of the first (second) primary subsequence, S1 (S2 ) and $a1 is a scalar variable having a value which is the nucleotide sequence of the additional subsequence, A1. A nucleic acid produces an observation of this sequence set only if the string representing the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid matches regular expression (1). In other words, the sequence string must have subsequence $s1 , followed by exactly N occurrences of any nucleotide, followed by subsequence $a1, followed by any number (or zero) of nucleotides, and lastly followed by subsequence $s2 . For a concrete example, if S1 has the sequence GAATTC (i.e., the value of $s1), A1 has the sequence AACGGTT (i.e., the value of $a1), S2 has the sequence AAGCTT (i.e., the value of $s2 ), and A1 is adjacent to S1 then the regular expression defining the sequence set pattern is: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>GAATTC AACGGTT&lsqb;A,C,T,G&rsqb;*AAGCTT. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> (blanks present for clarity only). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In more detail, sequence search step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> reads sequence entries from database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, and retrieves sequence string data from the entries. Next, this step parses these lines according to each previous regular expression representing an observed sequence set from input sequence sets <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>, and returns the identity of those sequence entries matching a regular expression representing an observed sequence sets. Details of these sequences, for example, the sequence accession number and gene name, can then be retrieved from sequence entry parameter data lines and displayed to the user on, e.g., terminal <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, or stored for future retrieval (see below). Where quantitative abundance information is observed along with sequence set identification, as is preferred, this information can also be output to the user. Construction of such a program in an appropriate computer language, for example, Perl, in view of this foregoing detailed description is routine for those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the construction of database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> of sequences likely to be present in the sample can be avoided. In such an implementation, first, the method call selection step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> to retrieve each entry from the appropriate division (or divisions) of sequence database <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> and to select those sequence entries likely to be present in the sample according to the previously described criteria, second, passes each selected sequence entry directly to sequence search step, and third, call sequence search step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> to parse as previously the selected sequence with regular expressions representing each observed sequence set. In this manner, intermediate storage of database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> is thereby, avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, sequence search step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is replaced by the further steps illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. This alternative implementation is directed to making more efficient those applications involving multiple, repetitive searches of a single (or slowly changing) database of sequences likely to be present in a sample. Such an exemplary application can involve repetitive analysis of similar samples from the same species. According to the prior implementation, the time for each search of database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> is proportional to the product of the sum of sizes of all the regular expressions representing the observed sequence sets and the total complexity of database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> (the sum of the lengths of sequences in this database). Generally, increased database search efficiency can be achieved by preliminary creation of an index of substrings for the nucleotide sequences in database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>. Using such an index, the time for a search of database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> is proportional only to the size of the regular expressions representing the observed sequence sets, a typically considerable improvement. The overhead of index creation, which is preferably linear in the total complexity of database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>, is amortized over all the individual sequence set searches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Various data structures for such substring indexes are well known in the art. See, e.g., Gonnet, Handbook of gorithms and Data Structures, Addison-Wesley, London (1984); Califano et al., <highlight><italic>Proceeding, First International Conference on Intelligent System in Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>A.A.A.I. Press, Menlo Park, Calif., 56-64 (1993); Manber et al., <highlight><italic>Proceeding: First Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete gorithms, </italic></highlight>ACM, New York, N.Y., 319-327 (1990); McCreight, J. Assoc. Comp. Mach. 23:262-272 (1976); and Kempf et al., Acta Informatica 24:461-474 (1987). A preferred data structure is the position tree. See, e.g., Aho et al., <highlight><italic>The Design And Analysis of Computer gorithms, </italic></highlight>Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass. (1974). It is well known in the art that position trees are capable of improving the performance of queries to nucleotide and other biological sequence databases. See, e.g., Gonnet et al., Science 256:1443-1445 (1992); Lefevre et al., Comp. Appl. Biosc. 9:343-348 (1993); Lefevre et al., Comp. Appl. Biosc. 9:349-354 (1993); and Bieganski et al., <highlight><italic>Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences Vol </italic></highlight>5<highlight><italic>Biotechnology Computing, </italic></highlight>I.E.E.E. Comp. Soc. Press 35-54 (1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In detail, a position tree for a string, such as a nucleotide sequence, is a tree with leaves uniquely corresponding to each nucleotide position of the string and edges labeled by nucleotides, such that the sequence of edge labels from the root to a leaf corresponding to a particular position is the subsequence identifying that position in the sequence. A subsequence identifying a particular position in the sequence is the shortest unique subsequence of the sequence that begins at that position. Algorithms for the construction of such a tree in a time linear in the length of the input sequence are known in the art and discussed in the previous references. A database of sequences can be considered for this purpose as the single sequence which is formed by concatenating all the database sequence, each database sequence being terminated in the concatenation by a unique inter-sequence character. A position tree can be used for pattern matching by following the path from the root whose edges are labeled by the nucleotides of the pattern. See, e.g. Aho et al., Section 9.5. A preferred implementation of a position tree, termed a hashed position tree, is directed to the requirements of searching large sequence databases and is designed to efficiently use secondary storage to for storing index information. See, e.g., Mewes et al., Genome Analysis: Pattern Search In Biological Macromolecules, in Galil et al. eds., Combinatorial Pattern Matching, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 937, Springer, Berlin (1995), for the structure and storage layout of hash position trees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the additional steps of this alternative embodiment include, first, index construction step <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, this step constructs a hashed position tree index stored in database <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> for the sequences in database <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> of sequences likely to be present in the sample (or alternately of appropriate divisions of sequence database <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>). Database <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> is database <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> reorganized (if necessary) to permit efficient indexing. though index <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> is illustrated as resident entirely on disk, it is preferable for efficient access that as much as possible of the index reside in memory during processing, with the non-resident parts accessible in a single disk access. A hash position tree is so structured. Next, sequence search step <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> takes as input regular expressions representing the observed sequence sets <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>, reorganized sequence database <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, and constructed index <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, and searches for all sequence strings matching one of the regular expressions. The results are output to the user on, e.g., terminal <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>, as previously. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to construct programs for index construction and index search in a general-purpose language such as C or C&plus;&plus; in view of the prior description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Further alternative implementations of the database searching steps optimized for specific applications will be apparent to those of ordinary skill. In particular PCT Publication No. 97/15690 contains extensive discussion of the computer processing of observations, like sequence sets, generated from nucleic acids in a sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Thereby, upon the completion of this step of database searching, candidate sequences are identified and quantified for nucleic acids present in the original sample. The candidate sequences identified are those sequences having observed sequence sets, as determined by their matching one of the input regular expressions. The candidates are quantified with the quantitative values observed for the corresponding sequence sets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Various optional subsequent steps are appropriate for particular applications of the instant invention. A generally preferable further step is to store the results of the located candidate sequences and associated sequence database information together with an annotation of the nature of the original samples themselves for later processing and analysis. This storage is preferably organized in a relational format in a relational database system, and less preferably organized in other storage formats (such as text files). Accordingly, sequence search step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> also outputs results to database storage system <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. These results advantageously include both the presence and the amount of candidates in the nucleic acid sample. The database storage system also receives input <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> describing the samples, for example their origin and processing, from which the gene-expression results originated. These two pieces of information are coordinated and stored in permanent computer-readable storage <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. Although illustrated as magnetic disc storage, permanent storage can be any form of such storage, including forms of semiconductor storage or optically based storage. Further, where confirmation steps (described in Section 5.1.4) have been performed, the candidate sequence information can be annotated to indicate its confirmation status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Additional processing of the stored results can be advantageous, and processing and analysis step <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> generally includes means for a user to request various such additional processing and comparing and to receive output from these requests. Such additional processing can include simply redisplay of previously stored data for later review. More importantly, the stored data can be combined for various comparative analyses. For example, where a differential gene-expression experiment results in gene-expression data from tissue samples in controlled and related biological states, this data can be compared for interesting gene-expression differences. The quantitative gene-expression information in one dataset from one tissue sample can be subtracted, or otherwise numerically compared, with that from another dataset from a second tissue sample in order to yield differential expression information. In this manner, e.g., gene-expression in diseased and normal states can be compared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, such comparison can also involve more complex combinations. For example, where the genomic effects of a particular treatment for a particular disease in an organism are sought, permanent storage <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> can contain datasets reflecting the results of gene-expression experiments of this invention performed on nucleic acid samples from diseased-untreated tissue samples, normal-untreated tissue samples, diseased-treated tissue samples, and normal-treated tissue samples. As before, comparisons of datasets from the diseased-untreated tissue samples with those from the normal-untreated tissue samples can reveal genetic effects of the disease alone. Comparisons of datasets from the normal-treated tissue samples with those from the normal-untreated tissue samples can reveal the genetic effects and side effects, perhaps toxic, of the treatment on a normal organism. Additionally, comparisons of datasets from the diseased-treated tissue samples with those from the normal-treated tissue samples can reveal the total effects of the treatment in the context of the disease. Even more specific genetic effects of treatment can be seen by comparing datasets from the diseased-treated tissue samples with a comparison of normal-treated and normal-untreated datasets. Such a multiple comparison can reveal those unique genetic effects of the treatment in the context of the disease that are different from the effects of the treatment on the normal organism. Further useful comparisons will be apparent to one of average skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, analysis step <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> is advantageously constructed to accept requests from the user to perform various manipulations and comparisons on the data, where two, three, four, or more datasets are combined and compared according to various operations. Preferable comparison operations include algebraic operations (for example, finding differential gene-expression), boolean operations (for example, finding the presence or absence of gene-expression), and thresholding operations (for example, finding differential gene-expression above a certain threshold) on corresponding data values (data values relating to the same candidate nucleic acid) of the datasets. Operations supported also allow advantageously combinations of comparisons from different candidate nucleic acids into one criteria. Construction of programs to scan databases and perform such combinations and operations on retrieved data items are routinely built with standard tools using the facilities of, e.g., SQL queries and general purpose programming languages. Construction of such programs is within average skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Further, processing and analysis step <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> can advantageously perform user requests for various types of homology searches. Located candidate sequences can be searched to find sequences having homologies, either at the nucleotide sequence level or at the protein sequence level, with a particular user query sequence. For example, identified sequences can be searched for those that are either (fully or partially) homologous to a nucleotide sequence of user interest, or for those that have protein products with protein homologies, or domains or motifs of user interest. Such homology search programs can be built on known algorithms, e.g., BLAST and BLAZE (Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol., 215:403-510). Publicly available search tools of this type are exemplified by BLASTN and BLASTP (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, Md.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> In further embodiments, this invention includes computer systems for performing such manipulations and comparisons on data previously stored on computer-readable storage media. Such systems include processing means for user requests and user input/output means for receiving requests and displaying processing responses. Processing means include programs for carrying out processing and analysis step <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>, and in particular for carrying out the previously described user requests. These means also can access permanent storage systems <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> and computer-readable media <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, on which are recorded the results of gene-expression experiments performed according to this invention. Input/output means include, for example, user terminals or PCs presenting a range of input modalities, such as keyboards and pointing devices, and a range of output devices, such a graphics displays and printers. Input/output means and processing means can be collocated on one computer system, or alternately, can be located on separate client and server systems, respectively, connected by a network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates exemplary hardware means preferred for executing the programs of this invention. In general, the powers and capacities of these means are adapted, as routinely known in the art, to the size of the databases stored and to the required search times and the types of user processing. For example, database storage and user request processing can be performed on a single or multi-processor Pentium (Intel Corp.) server computer system <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> running Windows NT Server (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Wash,). Alternately, system <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> can be a single or multi-processor server computer system from Sun (Mountain View, Calif.) running a version of the UNIX operating systems. In both cases, sufficiently numerous and capable server system processors are provided to process the expected number of parallel sequence set queries and user processing requests. Sufficient server system main memory is provided so that key components of the operating system and application programs can be memory resident along with sufficient data buffers for adequate search performance. Storage system <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, for example system hard disks, is preferably provided to store on-line at least all the sequence and experimental results databases previously described. Preferably server systems also are provided with removable storage systems <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, which can be tape or CD-ROM drives. A communications connection to the Internet is also preferable. Updated sequence database information can be obtained by either means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> User input/output means can be variously provided wither by direct attachment of user display <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> to server system <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, or by attachment of user display <highlight><bold>1109</bold></highlight> to local user system <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. In the latter case, local user system <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is connected to server system <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> by an, e.g., LAN connection <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>. Additionally, local system <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> can have local storage <highlight><bold>11071</bold></highlight>, local printers <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, and other peripherals. User terminals can run, e.g., the Windows NT Client or the Window 95 system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.1.4 Confirmation Steps </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the previous steps of the methods of this invention, candidate sequences for nucleic acids present in the original sample are identified, to the expected resolution, and quantitated. This invention includes optional, additional confirmation steps, which permit unequivocal and independent identification of the candidate sequences of particular interest previously identified by database search. These confirmation methods can also additionally serve to verify that additional subsequences have been correctly identified by, e.g., a UDA device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Candidate nucleic acid sequences, which the previous database search step identified as containing observed sequence sets, can be of sufficient interest to apply the confirmation steps for several reasons. For example, a certain observed sequence set may be of interest if the database search identifies no candidate nucleic acids. Such sequence sets may derive from novel genes, novel gene regions, alternative splices of known genes, or additional members of gene families. Another observed sequence set may be of interest if the database search identifies multiple candidate nucleic acids. Such may occur because the resolution associated with the choice of subsequence lengths, as previously described, may be insufficient to permit a unique nucleic acid identification. Here, it may be of interest to determine exactly which candidate is actually present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Finally, even if database search uniquely identifies a candidate sequence for a certain sequence set, this sequence set may be of interest if it has a different or unexpected quantitative intensity. Such a differentially expressed sequence set can arise from a gene is dysregulated or altered in the source cell or tissue used for preparing the sample. For example, two input samples of nucleic acids can be derived from similar tissues in pairs of comparable states. Pairs of comparable states can be normal versus physiologically perturbed, normal versus diseased, untreated diseased versus treated diseased, and so forth. Next sequence sets derived from the two samples are observed and comparisons made between the quantitative intensities of sequence sets derived from the two input samples. Different intensities for a particular sequence set can indicate alterations in the expression of one or more genes, gene families, alternatively spliced forms, or other genetic or epigenetic change(s). Unequivocal identification of the source of such sequence sets is of interest even if database search uniquely identified a candidate gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Having selected certain observed sequence sets of interest for confirmation for any of the above (or other) reasons, there are, according to this invention, two preferred methods for independent identification and verification of candidate DNA fragments from the subsample pool. A first method, termed selective amplification, utilizes a phasing primer for selective PCR amplification of those nucleic acids fragments in the subsample pool having the subsequence set of interest. The amplified and isolated fragment(s) are sequenced to confirm the identity of the fragment. A second method, termed signal suppression, utilizes an unlabeled phasing primer in molar excess (for example, 100-200 fold excess) to the labeled primer, which was used for the PCR amplification in the first method step, to competitively reduce or substantially eliminate observations of the sequence set of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Both confirmation methods use a phasing primer constructed to recognize and amplify only those nucleic acid fragments with a particular sequence set. In the previous PCR amplification used to generate subsamples with fragments of the structure of fragment <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), primer sequences <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, or a similarly labeled, hybridizable portion of sequences <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, were used as PCR primers. The instant phasing PCR primer extends the primer having only sequence <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> (or a hybridizable portion of this sequence) with one also including subsequence <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and additional subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the phasing primer only hybridizes with and amplifies only fragments having a particular specified additional sequence. In other words, this phasing primer amplifies only fragments with the corresponding sequence set. The second primer, having only sequence <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> (or a hybridizable portion of this sequence), can be used as previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In more detail, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the structure of a phasing primer. Phasing primer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is composed of three subsequences, which are in 5&prime; to 3&prime; order subsequence <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, subsequence <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, and subsequence <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Subsequence <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is a hybridizable portion of the sequence <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and is preferably 10-14 bases long. It includes part of all of Type IIS recognition subsequence <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Subsequence <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is complementary to the remaining portion of the Type II recognition sequence, subsequence <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Finally, 3&prime; terminal subsequence <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is complementary to the particular candidate subsequence <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for the particular sequence set. For selective amplification, the phasing primer may be labeled or unlabeled. For signal suppression, the phasing primer is unlabeled. Finally, the phasing primer may contain one or more modifications known in the art, but is, preferably, unmodified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Both confirmation methods proceed by a confirmation PCR amplification of a diluted aliquot of the subsample using a primer set including a phasing primer directed to the particular sequence set of interest. An aliquot of the nucleic acid subsample, after the steps of RE cutting, adapter ligation and PCR amplification, is diluted at least 1:100, or preferably 1:1000, or 1:10,000, or more. PCR amplification is performed as previously for 6, 10, 14, or more cycles, respectively, using conditions optimized for specificity and reproducibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> For the method of selective amplification, only fragments having the particular additional subsequences are amplified (which are in turn derived from nucleic acids with the particular sequence set). Amplified fragments in the reaction products can be then identified by separation and sequencing. The reaction products can be separated by any method known in the art, preferably by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized using appropriate staining procedures or primer labels. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor Press, (2nd. ed., 1989). The apparent length of the PCR products can be estimated by comparison to molecular size standards. A plurality of PCR products with different sizes means that multiple nucleic acids in the sample contained the particular sequence set. Further, it is preferable to extract and purify each separated reaction product. Any extraction procedure known in the art can be used, such as, e.g., electrophoretic separation of bands and extraction and purification using a commercial gel extraction kit, such as QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiaqen (Hilden, Germany). The extracted product from each individual band can be re-amplified. Additionally, the sizes of the PCR fragments and clones should match the subsequence length for at least some of the hits identified by database searches. Alternately and less preferably, the products from the PCR reaction can be ligated into a suitable vector, transformed into a suitable <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>host and cloned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The separated products can be sequenced by any method known in the art. In particular Sanger sequencing reaction products can be separated on a commercial gel electrophoresis device to determine the sequence. For example, the sequencing kit ABI PRISM&trade; dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit together with an ABI 377 (Applied Biosystems, Inc. Foster City, Calif.) device can be used. The fragment sequences obtained can be matched with sequences present in DNA sequence databases in order to identify the fragment by using, e.g., the BLASTN program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the methods of selective amplification identify the nucleic acids in the sample contributing to a particular sequence set observations of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The confirmation method of signal suppression confirms that the particular sequence set of interest was correctly observed by, e.g., a UDA. If the sequence set was correctly observed, signal suppression results in suppression of the observed signal after a second, confirmatory PCR amplification and additional subsequence observation. For this method, a diluted aliquot of the nucleic acid fragment subsample is subjected to a confirmatory PCR amplification as previously described, except for the primers present. The original primers based on subsequences <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) are used as described in the previous subsection along with a molar excess (preferably 100 to 200 fold) of the unlabeled phasing primer. Since the excess phasing primer competitively amplifies fragments having the particular sequence set, these products are therefore unlabeled. All other fragments will be amplified and labeled as previously. Upon determination of the additional subsequence, for example, by a UDA, the signal from the particular sequence set is suppressed. However, if the additional sequence was incorrectly determined, the phasing primers will not suppress the signal of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> According to these confirmation methods both the correct observation of a sequence set of interest can be verified, and the identities of nucleic acids producing an observed sequence set of interest can be independently confirmed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.2 Universal Detection Arrays </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> A universal detection array (UDA) is a set of probe oligonucleotides designed to recognize terminal subsequences of target nucleic acids in a sample of nucleic acids. In one embodiment, a UDA is universal because it is capable of recognizing all terminal subsequences of a given length, N, in which case it includes 4<highlight><superscript>N </superscript></highlight>species of probes, one for each possible terminal subsequence of length N. In another embodiment, a UDA is designed to recognize only certain nucleic acids of interest, in which case it includes fewer than 4<highlight><superscript>N </superscript></highlight>species of probe oligomers. Generally, in both embodiments, target recognition depends on probe hybridization to the terminal subsequences recognized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> In a preferred application to the gene-calling methods of Section 5.1, a UDA is used to recognize short terminal subsequences of a nucleic acid. The length of recognized terminal subsequences is preferably between 4 and 12 nucleotides, and more preferably between 6 and 8 nucleotides. Preferably, methods of using a UDA includes features to stabilize hybridization to such short terminal subsequences, including enzymatic recognition of hybridization and base stacking energetic assists. According to the preferred embodiment of this invention, a UDA is used preferably, according to the methods of hybridization/ligation (&ldquo;h/l&rdquo; method) or strand invasion ligation (&ldquo;SIL&rdquo; method), both of which incorporate such features. Target nucleic acids are preferably fluorescently labeled and detection of recognition is by fluorescent imaging. The location of a fluorescent signal on the array indicates the terminal subsequence recognized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The following subsections describe details of construction and use of a UDA. First, the construction of a UDA is described in separate subsections detailing the design of probe oligomers and the physical layout and preparation of a UDA. Second, the use of a UDA is described in separate subsections detailing the method of hybridization/ligation, the method of strand invasion ligation, and the methods of detection. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.2.1 Probe Design </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, a probe oligomer is a substantially linear structure having several regions of defined internal function and structure, one of which functions to hybridize with and recognize short terminal subsequences of a target nucleic acid. In a preferred but non-limiting embodiment, probe oligomer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> to be comprised of 5 regions: hybridization region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, linker region <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and functional group <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. One or more of these regions can be nucleotide polymers and the remainder of the regions can be polymers of other than nucleotide monomers, or of alternative structure. In this subsection, these regions are described in the listed order, followed by description of certain probe alternatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Hybridization region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is a terminal region of a probe molecule that participates directly in recognition of a terminal subsequence of a target nucleic acid according. Preferably, this is an oligonucleotide sequence that recognized by hybridization, according to either the h/l or the SIL methods. The direct h/l methods, described in Section 5.2.3, recognize only single-stranded terminal subsequences, In this case, region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is, preferably, of the same length as such a single-stranded terminal region in the target nucleic acids. The SIL methods, described in Section 5.2.4, recognize a terminal subsequence including a short double-stranded subsequence adjacent to the terminating single-stranded region. In this case, region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is the sum of the number of nucleotides in the single-stranded overhang and the number in the adjacent double-stranded subsequence. Alternatively, this region can include one or more nucleotide mimics, such as, e.g., peptido-nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The sequence of the oligonucleotide hybridization regions of probes in a UDA varies according to the application of the UDA. Since a probe recognizes a terminal subsequence of a target by hybridization of the probe to the target terminal subsequence, where the UDA is designed to recognize all possible terminal subsequences of length N, the UDA should include probes with hybridization regions of all possible sequences of length N (i.e., a universal set), that is 4<highlight><superscript>N </superscript></highlight>probe species are necessary. The length N is the length of a terminal single-stranded subsequence, and for the SIL method, the adjacent double-stranded region. For example, if the length N is 4 bases the maximum number of probe species in the UDA is 4<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>or 256; if N is 5 bases the UDA size is 5<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>or 1024; if N is 6 bases, the UDA size is 6<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>or 4096; if 7 bases, it is 16,384; if 8 bases, it is 65,536; and so on. Preferably, the length of the hybridization region is between 4 and 8 nucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In other applications, the UDA can be designed to use a partially known terminal subsequence of target nucleic acids to increase hybridization specificity. In this case, target nucleic acids have known nucleotides at certain positions in their terminal subsequences, which are complementary to the known nucleotides at the corresponding positions in the terminal subsequence. In particular, in the case of the SIL method, all or the distal part of the double stranded region may be known and shared in all target nucleic acids. Then, the hybridization regions include a terminal fixed subsequence adjacent to a variable subsequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Finally, in further applications, a UDA may be designed to recognize only certain nucleic acids of interest in a sample. When used according to the gene-calling methods of Section 5.1, such a UDA recognizes only the certain additional subsequences (A1) of the sequence sets characterizing the nucleic acids of interest. In this case, the UDA need include only probe species having oligomer hybridization regions complementary to these certain additional subsequences. Such an application can be directed, for example, to analysis of patient samples for medical diagnostic purposes, for monitoring therapy, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of the probe molecule, adjacent to hybridization region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, is preferably an oligonucleotide (but can also include nucleotide mimics). The length and sequence of the core region is subject to several requirements. One such requirement derives from keeping hybridization region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> sufficiently removed from any support to minimize stearic hindrance during target nucleic acid hybridization with the hybridization region. Further, when stacking oligonucleotides are used (see below), core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> itself must be kept sufficiently removed from any support to minimize stearic hindrance during stacking oligonucleotide hybridization with core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. This sufficient distance is known to be at least 40-60 atoms, or equivalently at least 6-10 nucleotides in length, for hybridization alone (Schepinov et al., 1997, Nuc. Acids Res. 25:1155-1161), and to be at least 50 A for hybridization together with enzymatic ligation of hybridized nucleic acids (Broude et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A 91:3072-3076). Therefore, the length in nucleotides of core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, along with the lengths of both spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and linker region <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, are so chosen that this sufficient distance is met to obviate hybridization hindrances due to stearic effects of the support to which the probe oligomer is anchored. Another requirement on the length of core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is that it be sufficiently long so that stacking oligomers can be designed with sufficiently strong hybridization characteristics (see below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Other requirements to which core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> are subject derive from criteria for adequate hybridization with a stacking oligomer, which is at least partially complementary to the core region. The stacking oligomer (or oligonucleotide) preferably hybridizes adjacent to the hybridization region in order that there be base stacking interactions with a hybridized target nucleic acid. Preferably, the stacking oligomer hybridizes with the entire core region. In any ease, the duplex of a core region and a stacking oligomer should have a sufficient Tm in view of the washing steps in the h/l and SIL methods (see below), which are designed to remove from an array mis-hybridized and non-specifically bound nucleic acids. (Mis-hybridization occurs if the oligomers undergo non-complementary hybridization or if the hybridized oligomers are not correctly aligned.) (Non-specific binding occurs if oligomers adhere to components of a UDA by interactions other than complementary base-pairing interactions, such as e.g., mere electrostatic attraction.) Therefore, T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>s should be at least approximately 40-45&deg; C., preferably 50-55&deg; C., and more preferably 60-65&deg; C. for maximal discrimination between ligated and un-ligated species of stacking oligomer. Accordingly, core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is preferably between 12 and 36 nucleotides, and is more preferably at least 16 nucleotides long with an at least 45% G&plus;C content. (Accordingly, the core plus hybridization regions are preferably at least 20 nucleotides long.) Advantageously, the core region sequence is also limited to be free of secondary structure, dimers, hairpins, and so forth. It is preferable, but optional, that all the core regions in a UDA have the same sequence. Core region sequences can be designed in detail in view of these length and sequence requirements by method known in the art, for example, by software packages are available for oligomer construction, such as OLIGO&trade; from National Biosciences, Inc. (Plymouth, Minn.). The following exemplary core region sequence satisfies the previous requirements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The spacer region, linker region, and functional group form the attachment means. These attachment means link the hybridization and core regions to a support while promoting hybridization by reducing stearic hindrance, excess charge, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, adjacent to core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, is also preferably an oligonucleotide advantageously used to obtain sufficient distance between hybridizing region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and/or core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and the array supports in order to minimize stearic hindrance of hybridization and ligation. A sufficient distance, preferably 30-70 &angst;, and more preferably at least 50 &angst;, between the support and areas of hybridization on the probe oligomer can be achieved by the length of the spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, by length of the linker region <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, (see below) or by the sum of both lengths. It is preferred that most of the distance be achieved by the linker region, the spacer region being optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The preferred sequence of spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is (dN)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, where dN is any deoxyribonucleotide and &ldquo;n&rdquo; is length of the oligomer. Preferably, space region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> has the sequence (dT)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, where n&equals;5 to 20. Alternatively, the spacer region can have any sequence preferably not containing palindromic regions, G&plus;C rich regions, subsequences of significant complementarity to the core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, or regions of self-complementarity. Spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> can also be modified as described subsequently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, regions of probes specified herein to be oligonucleotide, and other oligonucleotides of this invention, can include oligonucleotide mimics, such as peptide-nucleic acids (&ldquo;PNAs&rdquo;). See, e.g., Weiler et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25, 2792-2799. In a PNA the bases are linked via N-(2-aminomethyl)-glycine unit. As a result, PNA:DNA duplexes exhibit higher stability than the corresponding DNA:DNA hybrids (&tilde;1.5 degrees Celsius per base pair) due to lack of the inter-strand repulsion between DNA phosphate groups. This is advantageous to improve the hybridization specificity of shorter oligomers. Single-stranded oligomers can include or be exclusively PNAs. Suitable double-stranded oligomers may be constructed entirely from PNAs or from mixed PNA and DNA, or mixed PNA, DNA, and RNA oligomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Linker region <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, adjacent to spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, is designed in view of its charge, length, and hydrophobicity and salvation. Concerning charge, it is preferable the linker region be substantially neutral in order to increase hybridization of target nucleic acids and stacking oligomers to probes. The negatively charged phosphodiester backbones of hybridization region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, and optional spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, especially when concentrated in a limited area of a support, can repel the similarly negatively charged backbone of a target nucleic acid. See, e.g., Schepinov et al., 1997, Nuc. Acids Res. 25:1155-1161. Consequently to reduce such concentrated negative charge and electrostatic interaction of the linker with the remainder of the probe, it is preferably that the linker be substantially neutral. Further, to minimize total probe charge, it is preferred that linker region <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> partially or wholly replace <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, as advancements are made in the technology for synthesizing longer and stable linkers. Concerning length, the linker region should be of a length such that, combined with the length of the spacer region, stearic hindrance of target nucleic acid or stacking oligomer hybridization due to probe supports is minimized. Accordingly, it is preferable that linker region <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> not be an oligonucleotide. It is most preferable that linker region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> be a hydrophobic aliphatic chain, more preferably an aliphatic chain having a length of the form of (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>to (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>40</subscript></highlight>, which have an extended length of approximately 50-100 &angst;, and most preferably an aliphatic chain of approximately the length (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>to (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>20</subscript></highlight>. Alternately, the linker can be substituted with neutral groups in order to increase its hydrophilic character. Such linkers can be synthesized from monomeric units including propanediol, di- or tri-ethylene glycol. Either aliphatic or substituted aliphatic chains can be covalently attached to the terminal nucleotide of spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> according to such chemistries as synthesis of the last dT residue in the space region with a modified phosphoramidite containing the appropriate linker and functional group as a modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> In addition, the linker can include a segment that permits chemical cleavage of the probe from the UDA support. For example, incorporation of the reagent (2-cyano-ethoxy)-2-(2&prime;-O-DMTr oxyethylsulfonyl) ethoxy-N,N-diisopropylaminophosphine during linker synthesis permits selective cleavage of the oligomer by treatment with ammonia. See, e.g., Schepinov et al., 1997, Nuc. Acids Res. 25:1155-1161. A cleavable linker section can aid in the isolation and identification of rare species of nucleic acids, even single copies of nucleic acids in the sample. Specifically, after target nucleic acid ligation according to the h/l method, isolation is achieved by cleavage of the linker followed by PCR amplification of the ligated target and Sanger sequencing of the PCR product. This method can be applied to those probes that have low signals difficult to detect by the preferred optical detection methods described below. Probes with cleavable linkers can be mixed with non-cleavable probes and bound together to the same regions of a UDA or a separate array can be constructed having exclusively probes with cleavable linkers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> The terminal component of a probe is function group <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, which is covalently attached to linker region <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, either at or near its terminus. Functional group <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is chosen to readily bind to the derivitization provided on the surface of the array supports with sufficient energy to resist the washes used in the h/l and SIL methods of this invention. In particular, covalent attachment is preferable with alternative binding interactions, such as that of biotin with streptavidin/avidin less preferable. Functional group <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> can include such active moieties as amino, sulfhydryl, biotin, dinitrophenol, and so forth. In the case of amino, the surface can be derivitized with thiocyanate, isothiocyanate, or carboxylic acids. In the case of biotin, the surface can be derivitized with avidin or streptavidin. In the case of dinitrophenol, digoxigenin, or other hapten, the surface can be derivitized with an antibody to these moieties. In the case of glass surfaces, derivitized with phenylisothiocyanate groups, an amino functional groups is preferred. Alternately, in the case of a surface with bound streptavidin, a biotin functional group is preferred. Exemplary probes are illustrated in the Examples set forth in Section 6. Such probes can be synthesized by well known methods for synthesis of polynucleotides, such as, e.g., phosphoramidite chemistry performed by a commercial synthesizer, exemplary synthesizers being obtainable from Applied BioSystems, Inc. (Foster City, Calif.). The linker and functional group can be added by a modifying the phosphoramidite used to link the last nucleotide to also contain the appropriate linker and functional group. See, e.g., Schepinov et al., 1997, Nuc. Acids Res. 25:1155-1161. Alternately, the probes of this invention can be supplied by commercial suppliers, such as, e.g., Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, Tex.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of this invention where DNA oligomers are specified for performing functions, including use in probes or for hybridization and chain elongation priming, alternative oligomers can be used that comprise those of the following nucleotide mimics which perform similar functions. Nucleotide mimics are subunits (other than classical nucleotides) which can be polymerized to form molecules capable of specific, Watson-Crick-like base pairing with DNA. The oligomers can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof. The oligomers can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone. The oligomers may include other appending groups such as peptides, hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (see, e.g., Krol et al., 1988<highlight><italic>, BioTechniques </italic></highlight>6:958-976), or intercalating agents (see, e.g., Zon, 1988<highlight><italic>, Pharm. Res. </italic></highlight>5:539-549). The oligomers may be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, hybridization-triggered cleavage agent, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The oligomers may also comprise at least one nucleotide mimic that is a modified base moiety which is selected from the group including, but not limited to, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xantine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5&prime;-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl) uracil, and 2,6-diaminopurine. The oligomers may comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including but not limited to arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, xylulose, nucleic acids (&ldquo;PNAs&rdquo;). See, e.g., Weiler et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25, 2792-2799. In a PNA the bases are linked via N-(2-aminomethyl)-glycine unit. As a result, PNA:DNA duplexes exhibit higher stability than the corresponding DNA:DNA hybrids (&tilde;1.5 degrees Celsius per base pair) due to lack of the inter-strand repulsion between DNA phosphate groups. This is advantageous to improve the hybridization specificity of shorter oligomers. Single-stranded oligomers can include or be exclusively PNAs.

<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> Linker region <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, adjacent to spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, is designed in view of its charge, length, and hydrophobicity and solvation. Concerning charge, it is preferable the linker region be substantially neutral in order to increase hybridization of target nucleic acids and stacking oligomers to probes. The negatively charged phosphodiester backbones of hybridization region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, core region <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, and optional spacer region <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, especially when concentrated in a limited area of a support, can repel the similarly negatively charged backbone of a target nucleic acid.

<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> The oligomers may contain additional modifications including, but not limited to, amino or sulfhydryl groups, fluorescent labels, metal ions, affinity labels, such as, biotin, digoxigenin, peptides, antibodies, or other labels that might allow advanced detection technologies be applicable to the present invention. These modifications may be added before, during or after the synthesis of the oligonucleotides either in precursor form, activatable form, or any other way known in the art. The modifications may be attached to either the 5&prime; or the 3&prime; end of the oligonucleotide or anywhere along its length. Amino modifications may include a C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>-amino, C<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>-amino, or other spacer molecules known in the art (Maskos and Southern, 1992, Nuc. Acids Res. 20:1679-1684). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Oligomers of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer (such as are commercially available from Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, etc.). As examples, phosphorothioate oligomers may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. (1988<highlight><italic>, Nucl.

<heading lvl="1">5.2.2 Array Physical Design </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> The subsection describes construction of a universal detection array. First, exemplary embodiments of the logical arrangement of a UDA are described. Second, materials and methods for constructing particular UDAs are described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment as previously described, a UDA is directed to recognizing all terminal subsequences of length N (typically 4 to 8) of target nucleic acids. In this case, the UDA includes 4<highlight><superscript>N </superscript></highlight>probes with hybridization regions capable of recognizing all subsequences of length N (termed herein a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; UDA). For ease of description only and without any limitation, this section describes a UDA ligation chip useful for recognizing 4 base terminal subsequences, and therefore having 256 species of probes (termed herein a &ldquo;256-array&rdquo;). UDAs capable of recognizing longer terminal subsequences can be built from 256-array building blocks, as described subsequently. Also as described, a UDA can be directed to recognizing only certain terminal subsequences of interest. In this case, the UDA includes fewer than 4<highlight><superscript>N </superscript></highlight>species of probes. Such an array can be simply constructed in the format of a complete UDA by including only the needed probes. If the resulting array is sufficiently sparse, then it may be rearranged into more compact formats to minimize use of support area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary arrangement for a 256-array described with respect to probe hybridization regions of sequences denoted as &ldquo;N<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.&rdquo; This array is generally illustrated as including a primary observation section outlined as section <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, together with optional but preferable error-checking sections. The primary observation section can be advantageously, but optionally, configured as a rectangular array of 16 sub-arrays, each sub-array configured as a rectangular array of 16 cells in which are bound individual species of probes. According to the illustrated labeling, N<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>vary over the possible nucleotides (A, T, G, and C in order) in a horizontal direction, with N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>varying more rapidly than N<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Similarly, N<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>vary over the possible nucleotides with N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>varying more rapidly than N<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Therefore, each sub-array of 16 cells has probes with a given nucleotide assignment for N<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and N<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>but with all possible nucleotide assignments for N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. In particular, cell <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> has a probe with a hybridization region of sequence TGGT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The rectangular (or square) arrays illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> are advantageous in that each cell has easily determined cell coordinates, and that the hybridization target is easily predictable from these coordinates. Other geometric designs with these properties are equally preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> An error checking section includes further cells designed to confirm that a signal observed from a particular cell in the primary observation array is in fact due to hybridization with the probe and not to an artifact, such as non-specific binding to the probe or to the substrate in the vicinity of the probe or to a mis-hybridization with a probe hybridization region. Such confirmation is a preferred feature of a UDA. Error-checking cells contain a mixture of probes, each with a particular hybridization region. If a correct hybridization occurs to a cell in the primary observational array containing probes having a particular hybridization region, then hybridization should also occur to all error-checking cells also containing probes with this particular hybridization region. Hybridization should not occur to error-checking cells not containing probes with this particular hybridization regions. Many schemes can be used for combining multiple probes into error-checking cells according to various error checking codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, error-checking cells contain hybridization regions fully degenerate on one or more nucleotides (termed herein &ldquo;degenerate&rdquo; probes) to which a target nucleic acid should hybridize if it also hybridizes to a cell in the primary observation array with probes having a unique hybridization region sequence. For example, if a target nucleic acid hybridizes with probes in cell <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, which have hybridization regions of the sequence TGGT, then it should also hybridize with cells containing such degenerate probes as NGGT (&ldquo;N&rdquo; is taken to stand for all nucleotides, and &ldquo;NGGT&rdquo; represents the particular sequences AGGT, TGGT, CGGT, GGGT, TNGT, TGNT, TGGN, NNGT, NGNT, and so forth, and it should not hybridize with cells containing such degenerate probes as NCGT, NAGT, NTGT, GNGT, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a complete error checking section can include cells with all degrees of degeneracy. In the following, nucleotide positions marked by &ldquo;-,&rdquo; and not marked by &ldquo;N,&rdquo; are taken to have fixed assignments in any one cell. Error checking cells of first-degree of degeneracy include those with sequences: N---, -N--, --N-, and ---N. Error checking cells of second-degree of degeneracy include those with sequences: NN--, N-N-, N--N, -NN-, -N-N, and --NN. Error checking cells of third-degree of degeneracy include those with sequences: NNN-, NN-N, N-NN, and -NNN. Finally, the error checking cell of fourth-degree of degeneracy has the sequence NNNN, but is of little interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In an actual embodiment, the error checking section of a UDA can include one or more cells of one of more of these degrees of degeneracy. It is preferred that sufficient error-checking cells be included so that every cell of the primary observational array is checked by at least one error-checking cell. Depending on the configuration of the primary array, such error-checking cells can be arranged within and adjacent to the primary array. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> first-degree groups -N-- and ---N are arranged adjacent to the sub-arrays of 16 cells of the primary array. For example, group 503 includes cells TAGN, TTGN, TGGN, and TCGN of the first-degree group ---N, and group <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> includes cells TNGA, TNGT, TNGG, and TNGC, of the first-degree group -N--. Therefore, hybridization at cell <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, if correct, should be confirmed by hybridization in error-checking cells TGGN and TNGT of groups <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, respectively. Further, the 16 cells of the second-degree groups NN-- and --NN are arranged in vertical column <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and horizontal column <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, respectively, adjacent to the primary observational array. For example, sub-column <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> includes cells NNGA, NNGT, NNGG, and NNGC, and sub-column <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> includes cells TANN, TTNN, TGNN, and TCNN. Therefore, hybridization at cell <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> should be confirmed by hybridization in error-checking cells NNGT and TGNN of sub-columns <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Further error-checking cells can be included adjacent to the primary observational array. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary embodiment with a complete set of such cells of all but the fourth degree groups. Thus, two 64-cell arrays <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> can include first-degree groups N--- and --N-; four 16-cell arrays <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> can include the remaining second-degree groups N-N-, N--N, -NN-, and -N-N; and the four 4-cell arrays <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> can include all the third-degree groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> If a signal from a cell of the primary observational array is not confirmed by the error-checking cells present in an implementation of a UDA, it is preferably ignored as artifactual. Preferably such a signal is confirmed by at least two error-checking cells, by at least four cells, by at least 50% of the possible error-checking cells, by at least 75%, by at least 90%, or by at least 100% of the possible error-checking cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, a UDA can also include alignment cells to aid in signal detection. Such cells have labeled probes and are positioned at known locations in order to provide a signal which the detection apparatus can use to position itself with respect to a UDA. For example, cells are positioned at periphery of the observational and the error-checking section in order to provide orienting signals for the detection apparatus. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, cell <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> is such a cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> A UDA capable of recognizing all terminal subsequences of length 5, and having 1024 species of probes (a &ldquo;1024-array&rdquo;), can be constructed from 256-array building blocks. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a 1024-chip including a primary observation array of four quadrants, each quadrant similar to a 256 grid as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. Probes in each quadrant, however, have hybridization regions of length 5, which are constructed from hybridization regions of the 256-array of length 4 by adding an extra nucleotide. Preferably, in each quadrant the extra base is uniformly either A, T, G, or C. Error checking can be performed separately on the four nucleotides which vary within each quadrant and on the fifth nucleotide. Within each quadrant, error checking can be performed as previously described. The error-checking probes can contain the fifth nucleotide of that array in order to check its hybridization. Alternatively, if these probes are degenerate at the fifth nucleotide, additional error checking on the fifth nucleotide can be performed by error checking cells of any degree of degeneracy, which, however, are not degenerate in the fifth nucleotide. Illustrated is an exemplary error-checking 256-array quadrant having cells of the sequence N----. For example, a hybridization signal recognizing a sequence TGGTA is confirmed in this array by a signal from error-checking cell NGGTA. Numerous other error checking possibilities degenerate in various combinations of nucleotides other than the fifth nucleotide include cells having such sequences as -N---, NN---, NNN--, and so forth, all of which can be applied to 1024-arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> UDAs of higher complexity, such as arrays having 4096, 16,384, 65,536, and more species of probes, can be constructed in a similar recursive manner. An array of increased complexity being constructed from four arrays of the immediately preceding complexity along with any optional extra error-checking cells. For example, a 4096-array can be constructed with a primary observational section of four 1024-arrays together with an optional array of error-checking cells for the sixth nucleotide of the hybridization region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> The remainder of this subsection describes methods and materials for the construction of UDAs according to the previous logical designs. In particular probe surface densities, surface binding chemistry, probe deposition protocols, and certain binding alternatives are described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> For implementations of a UDA on a planar surface, in order to maximize hybridization signals, it is important to deposit probes with an appropriate surface density. In general, lower probe surface densities hybridize with fewer target nucleic acids, and therefore, typically lead to less optimum signal intensities. Additionally, lower probe surface densities can become saturated with target nucleic acids, leading to excessively non-linear response of the hybridization signal to initial target nucleic acid concentrations. However, higher probe surface densities lead to higher stearic interference and increased charge repulsion between the oligonucleotide regions of the probes themselves and the target nucleic acids and stacking oligomers, as well as to interference with ligase enzymes used in hybridizing to a UDA. At too high surface densities, this interference and repulsion can also lead to less optimum signal intensities. One aspect of the instant invention is the discovery that these competing effects are balanced over a broad range of low to intermediate surface densities, all of which lead to adequate signal intensity from hybridized target nucleic acids along with economical use of probe molecules. This intermediate surface density is preferably determined empirically, separately in the case of each surface and surface treatment. This can be performed by varying the deposited surface density and observing test hybridization signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The preferred probe binding chemistry and protocols is next described. In general, attachment proceeds by first processing the planar surface with a derivitization method that provides functional groups on the planar support which are adapted to readily bind to corresponding functional group <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> provided on the probe. Second, the probes are then deposited on the derivitized planar support in conditions adapted to cause this binding. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, probe arrays are prepared on derivatized glass surfaces. Glass surfaces are preferred because they are readily available and inexpensive, possess relatively homogeneous chemical surfaces of understood properties, and are amenable to surface treatments using a variety of chemistries. See, e.g., Fodor et al., 1991, Science 251:767-773; McGall et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:13555-13560. Numerous surface derivitization methods are known for glass. In particular where the probes have an amino functional group, glass surfaces can be derivitized to have such surface functional groups as aldehyde, ketone, thiocyanate, isothiocyanate, phenylisothiocyanate, or carboxylic acid groups (Chrisey et al., 1996, Nuc. Acids Res 24:3040-3047). Glass surface derivitization can be performed according to these various known methods, but is preformed, preferably, by the introduction of amino-reactive phenylisothiocyanate groups onto glass surfaces for binding with amino containing probes (Guo et al., 1994, Nuc. Acids Res. 22:5456-5465). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Probe solutions are then deposited on glass surfaces so derivitized, and are reacted with amino functionalized probes under conditions that promote the binding of amino and phenylisothiocyanate groups. The probe concentrations applied to the surface can be varied to achieve desirable final surface densities. Suitable probe concentrations can be determined empirically by anchoring oligonucleotide solutions of various initial concentrations and hybridizing with test samples of labeled target nucleic acids in order to obtain suitable signal intensities. See, e.g., Section 6.5. It is preferred to use lower probe deposition-solution concentrations that remain consistent with adequate hybridization signals. Such lower concentrations make economical use of probes, which can become cumulatively expensive, especially for large arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> A wide range of effective initial concentrations of probe deposition-solutions can be employed in this invention. For use in the following preferred protocol, a less preferred range of concentrations is 200 &mgr;m to 20 mM, a preferred range of concentrations is 20-200 &mgr;m, and a more preferred range of concentrations is 2-20 &mgr;m. (Other preferred concentration ranges are 2 &mgr;m to 40 &mgr;m, 60 &mgr;m, 80 &mgr;m, 100 &mgr;m, and 150 &mgr;m.) l these concentrations give adequate hybridization signals, the lower concentrations being preferred in order to make quite economical use of probes. In particular, those probe deposition-solution concentrations below 2 &mgr;m that are found to give adequate hybridization signal intensities are even more preferred. (At the less preferred probe deposition-solution concentration of 5 mM the probe surface density has been observed to be approximately 500 &angst;<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per probe molecule, or approximately 0.3 picomole/square mm (Guo et al., 1994, Nuc. 3 Acids Res. 22:5456-5465)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> A preferred protocol for depositing arrays of probes on derivatized glass proceeds by the following general steps. First, glass surfaces are carefully cleaned glass and prepared to be in a defined and reproducible surface chemical state. Then available reactive sites on this prepared glass surface are saturated with amino groups by use of an amino containing silane. Substantially all these surface amino groups are converted into amino-reactive groups by reaction with the bi-functional amino-reactive reagent 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (&ldquo;PDC&rdquo;). Onto this controlled and reproducible amino-reactive derivitized glass surface, aliquots of buffered probe solutions of carefully selected concentrations are deposited and subjected to binding conditions. Finally, unbound amino-reactive groups are passivated by reaction with an amino containing reagent which does not produce a detectable signal during subsequence observation steps. Steps of this protocol are described in details with respect to the preferred reagents used. This invention can be adapted to other reagents with similar chemical functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in more detail, in a first step glass surfaces are cleaned and prepared. Glass slides, preferably of at least 1.8&times;1.8 cm size, can be used as glass surfaces in this protocol. Suitable slides are, for example, Fisher-Finest slides (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, N.H.). Surface cleaning and preparation is an important step and includes an initial cleaning with a general purpose laboratory glass cleaning reagent. A preferred such cleaning reagent is Rhodite&trade;, House of Rhodes (Hicksville, N.Y.). Initial cleaning is followed by a strongly alkaline wash by, e.g., soaking in 1-4 M (or higher) NaOH or other equivalent alkali for 3-6 hours, preferably slides are soaked in 1 M NaOH for 4 hours. A final surface cleaning and surface preparation step is washing in a strong acid, which leaves the surface in a definite and reproducible chemical state. Preferably, slides are soaked in concentrated nitric acid (greater than approximately 65% concentration) for from 4-16 hours. Alernatively, other equivalently strong acids (pH less than approximately 1), such as concentrated hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, can be used. Following cleaning and preparation, slides can be stored in a vacuum desiccator until the next protocol step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The next two protocol steps bind the preferred phenylisothiocyanate to the glass surfaces via an intermediate silanization step which contributes amino groups to the glass surface. Silanization is preferably accomplished by immersing the slides (for example 20 slides in 200 ml of solution) in 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane solution (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, Milwaukee, Wis.), 1% in 95% acetone in water, for approximately 2 mins. Alternatively, other times and concentrations that achieve surface site saturation can be used, such as 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane concentrations of 0.5% to 5% can be used with corresponding immersion times of 3-4 hours down to 1 minute. Alternative amino-silanes generally suitable for the purpose of amino-derivitizing a glass surface include those with the formula (R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)NR<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Si(R<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>), which has the following structure.

</chemistry-cwu>
</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Preferably, at least one of R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is an H. R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can be an optionally substituted aliphatic chain of from C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>, and is preferably a propyl or a butyl. At least one of R<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, and R<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is a R&mdash;O group, where R is an aliphatic chain, preferably a methyl or an ethyl. The remaining ones of R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, and R<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>can be optionally substituted aliphatic chains of from C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>. Exemplary silanes include the following compounds: 4-aminobutyldimethylmethoxysilane, 3-(1-aminopropoxy)-3,3-dimethyl-1-propenyl-trimethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltris(methoxyethoxyethoxy)-silane, n-(3-acryloxy-2-hydroxypropyl)-3-amino-propyltriethoxysilane, n-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, n-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, n-2-(aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltris(2-ethyl-hexoxy)silane (90%), 3-(1-aminopropoxy)-3,3-dimethyl-1-propenyl-trimethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltris(methoxyethoxyethoxy)-silane, 3-aminopropyldimethylmethoxysilane, 3-aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyldiisopropylethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and 3-aminopropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Next, the amino-derivitization introduced by the silanization is then converted to amino-reactivity by reacting the surface amino groups with PDC in order to couple phenylisothiocyanate groups to the surface amino groups. Conditions are chosen so that substantially all amino groups are so converted. Preferably, this is accomplished by immersing the slides in PDC solution (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, Milwaukee, Wis.), 0.2% in 10% pyridine/dimethyl formamide, for 2 hr with occasional stirring. Alternatively, other times and concentrations that substantial total conversion of the surface amino groups can be used, such as PDC concentrations of from 0.05% to 1% with corresponding immersion times of 3-4 hours to 10 mins. After methanol washing, the slides can be stored in a vacuum desiccator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Fourth, probes are deposited and bound to the derivitized slides. Probes are dissolved in an alkaline buffer (with a pH of 8-10 preferably approximately 9) at the desired and carefully chosen concentration (in the preferred ranges previously described). A sodium carbonate/bicarbonate solution (approximately 100 mM) is a suitable buffer. Aliquots of the probe deposition-solutions are then deposited on the slide surfaces. For definiteness and without limitation, each of the four 256-arrays of a 1024-array can be deposited as follows. For ease of handling, the 256 probes of one array can be placed individually into wells of a 384-well microtiter plate. An aliquot of each probe solution is then transferred from its well to its designated position on the array being deposited. Preferably, from 2 nl to 2 &mgr;l, and more preferably 25 nl, of probe solution is transferred into each cell of the array. The preferred cell size (diameter) obtained by transfer of 25 nl of probe solution is approximately 200 &mgr;m. With such a cell size, a preferred center-to-center distance of the cells is approximately 600 &mgr;m. With these sizings, the dimensions of 256-array is approximately 9.0 mm&times;9.0 mm. In the case that only a 256-array is to be deposited, only a single 256-array in one quadrant, or four identical 256-arrays in four quadrants, can be deposited on the 1.8&times;1.8 cm glass surface. In the case of a larger 4096-array, the sizings must be reduced in order to fit on a 1.8 cm&times;1.8 cm surface. For a 4096-array, preferably, approximately 5 nl or less of probe solution is deposited at a center-to-center distance of approximately 150 &mgr;m to obtain cells of average diameter approximately 100 &mgr;m. Arrays of larger sizes are preferably accommodated on more than one 1.8 cm&times;1.8 cm surface, or most preferably, generated using the alternative implementation, namely photolithography (as described below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Deposition of controlled aliquots of the probe solutions can be performed according 0 to several methods. The size of aliquots of probe solution is chosen in view of the desired spot size. For example, for a spot size of approximately 100 &mgr;m, approximately 2-8 nl of probe solution is deposited; for a spot size of approximately 200 &mgr;m, approximately 8-32 nl of probe solution is deposited. In a simplest method, adaptable to arrays of lower complexity, from 25 to 200 nl of probe solution is applied to a glass surface with a pipette or by dipping the tip of a needle into the DNA solution and touching it to the glass surface. Tips can be micro-machined to deliver aliquots down to approximately 5 nl. The latter method is preferably automated using a standard laboratory robot and a precise X-Y-Z table for accurate relative positioning of the glass surface, such as can be supplied by, e.g., T-Tech, Inc. (Atlanta, Ga.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> After deposition, probe molecules with amino functional groups are bound to the amino-reactive surface phenylisothiocyanate groups by gentle hydration by, for example, exposure to a humid atmosphere. For example, the slides can be incubated for 1-3 hours (preferably 1 hr) at 37&deg; C. in a petri dish containing a piece of Whatman &num;1 paper soaked in deionized H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and not in contact with the arrayed slide. The fifth and last step passivates any remaining amino-reactive groups by reacting them with a non-detectable (for example, non-fluorescent) amino bearing reagent, such as a primary amine or ammonia. Preferably, passivation is by an ammonia wash with 1% NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH for 2 minutes at room temperature. Alternatively, 0.1% to 5% NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH can be used with corresponding wash times of 1 hours to &frac12; min. Passivation concentrations and times are chosen so that substantially all remaining amino-reactive groups are reacted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> This invention is adaptable to other supports, appropriate derivitization methods, and corresponding probe functional groups besides the just described, derivitized, planar glass surfaces. Possible alternative probe supports include planar supports such as nitrocellulose, nylon, acrylamide gel, polystyrene, silicon dioxide, the latter perhaps configured as part of a micro-fabricated device, as well as non-planar supports such as controlled-pore glass beads, activated dextran, polystyrene or latex beads, activated sephadex or sephacryl beads, or microtiter plates. Before contacting the probes with the supports, support surfaces are first activated by chemical treatments so that specific surface functional groups are present that provide for a desired coupling chemistry with a functional group present on probes. For example, probes with a conjugated biotin are, preferably, anchored to surfaces containing avidin or streptavidin. Streptavidin coated beads for magnetic separation are available from Dynal AS (Lake Success, N.Y.). For another example, an aldehyde or carboxylic acid functional group on probes can be bound to latex microspheres containing hydrazide residues. See, e.g., Kremsky et al., 1987, Nucleic Acids Res 15:2891-2909. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> In particular, preferable beads are controlled-pore glass beads, which can be derivitized and used for probe attachment by the same methods as planar glass surfaces. In another example of an alternative support, probes, preferably with cleavable linker regions (see previous subsection), are immobilized on derivatized controlled pore glass beads. See, e.g. Maskos and Southern, 1992, Nuc. Acids Res. 20:1679-1684. An array, for example a 256-array, can be conveniently arranged in wells of a microtiter plate. For detection of rare target nucleic acids, probe oligomers are ligated to complementary nucleic acid targets present in a complex sample mixture, cleaved preferably by ammonolysis, and amplified by PCR using primers complementary to known regions of the probe and the target nucleic acid (e.g., complementary to primer sequences). Probe hybridization sequences can be chosen to recognize target nucleic acids of known sequence that may be present in the sample, or alternatively, can be chosen to select target nucleic acids previously recognized or suspected from gene calling. Section 5.1 describes the selection of hybridization region sequences in this case. The implementation is advantageous in expression and differential gene expression monitoring where the amount of sample available is limited, such as, single cells (for example single neurons), early zygotic developmental stages, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> For construction of arrays of complexity greater than 4096, for example arrays with 16,384, 65,536, or more species of probes, it is preferable to replace the previously described method of mechanical deposition process with a method involving direct synthesis of probes on substrates. Direct synthesis of deoxynucleotide oligomers on derivitized glass using a photolithography and light activated oligodeoxynucleotide synthetic chemistry in cells down to 100 &mgr;m&times;100 &mgr;m is known in the art. See, e.g., Lockhart et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnol. 14:1675-1680; Maskos et al., 1992, Nuc. Acids Res. 20:1679-1684. Such synthetic techniques permits an array of 16,382 probes to be synthesized on a single 1.8 cm&times;1.8 cm glass surface, and an array of 65,536 probes to be synthesized on one 2.5 cm&times;2.5 cm glass surface or on two 1.8 cm&times;1.8 cm glass surfaces. Using photolithographic techniques conventional in the semiconductor industry, arrays with densities of 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>sequences/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>can currently be synthesized, corresponding to cell sizes of 5-10 &mgr;m. See, e.g., Willson, 1994, in Thompson et al, eds., Introduction to Microlithography, 2nd ed., Am. Chem. Soc., Washington, D.C., pp. 139-267. McGall et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:13555-13560 report successful synthesis in 8 &mgr;m cells. This invention is adaptable to these alternate methods for direct synthesis of probes on surfaces. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.2.3 Method of Hybridization/Ligation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Universal device arrays (&ldquo;UDAs&rdquo;), consisting of arrays of probes and constructed according to the previous descriptions, are used for the parallel and simultaneous observation of terminal subsequences of target nucleic acids from a complex mixture of target nucleic acids. For example, the mixture of target nucleic acids can be prepared according to the methods of Section 5.1. Target nucleic acids hybridize to the probe array according to complementarity between their terminal subsequences and the hybridization regions of the probes. Upon this hybridization, UDAs can be used to generate terminal subsequence recognition signals according to various methods, preferred methods being the hybridization/ligation method (&ldquo;h/l&rdquo; method) and the strand-invasion ligation method (&ldquo;SI ligation method&rdquo; or &ldquo;SIL method&rdquo;). According to the h/l method, which is described in this subsection, a UDA can recognize a single-stranded terminal subsequence. According to the SIL method, which is described in the next subsection, a UDA can recognize a terminal subsequence which includes a single-stranded terminus adjacent to a short double-stranded region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> Both the h/l and SIL methods use various enzymatic and physical effects to improve hybridization, and thereby recognition signal, specificity and discrimination. The preferred effects utilized include ligase enzyme specificity and base stacking interactions. Concerning ligase specificity, nucleic acid ligase enzymes join nicks in nucleic acid strands of DNA hybridized to a complementary strand. Ligases are known in the art to discriminate between complementary and non-complementary nicked regions. In fact, ligation rates for exactly complementary double-stranded nucleic acids are 10 to 24 times greater than for double-stranded nucleic acids with even one base-pair of mismatch See, e.g., Broude et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3072-3076. This discrimination is greatest within 2 or 3 nucleotides of the nick to be ligated, gradually decreasing with increasing distance from the ligation point, and is retained even in the presence of an excess of unspecific DNA fragments containing non-complementary single-stranded regions. See, e.g., Luo et al., (1996) Nucleic Acids Res. 24:3071-3078. In the SIL method, a single ligation between a stacking oligomer and one strand of a hybridized target nucleic acid is used to improve discrimination. In the h/l method, ligation can occur with both strands of a hybridized nucleic acid at both ends of a single-stranded terminal subsequence. Thus, this latter method can advantageously employ the enhanced ligase discrimination over an entire 4 to 6 nucleotide, single-stranded terminal subsequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> This invention also advantageously exploits the effects of base stacking interactions on hybridizations. As is known in the art, when two single-stranded nucleic acids hybridize in an adjacent configuration onto a third single-stranded nucleic acid, the additional interaction energy of the adjacent bases contributes to overall hybridization stability. See, e.g., Lane et al., 1997, Nuc. Acids Res. 25:611-616; Parinov et al., (1996) Nuc. Acids Res. 24:2998-3004. The present invention utilizes the advantages of stacking interactions to enhance ligation efficiency. In both the h/l and SIL methods, stacking interactions are present at the ends of both strands of a correctly hybridized target nucleic acid, and thereby, increase the hybridization stability of this complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Stacking oligomers (oligomer <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>) are designed to cause stacking interactions with a correctly hybridized target nucleic acid and to have a Tm sufficiently high for the subsequent wash steps of the h/l and SIL methods. Stacking oligomers are, preferably, approximately at least 18 nucleotides long, and are hybridizable to core region <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> of the probe oligomer in a configuration such that the end of the stacking oligomer is flush with the end of the probe core region, thereby being contiguous with the probe hybridization region. Alternately, the stacking oligomer can have a length between 5 and 24 nucleotides. The sequence of the stacking oligomer is chosen for increased hybridization stability (Tm at least above 40-45&deg; C. as described in Section 5.2.1) with no likely secondary structure that might impede hybridization. Empirical rules are available for calculating duplex stabilities and likelihood of secondary structure (Wetmur, 1991, Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 26:227-259). The sequences of stacking oligomers and the complementary core region are chosen in view of these rules and the previous design goals. See Section 5.2.1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Stacking oligomers constructed according to the previous description (18 nucleotides or more) permits the use of high stringency washes to distinguish true signals from background. High stringency washes are advantageous to remove background signals due to both mis-hybridized (and therefore not ligated) targets and targets non-specifically bound to the probe oligomers, the substrates, or other components of a UDA, and to leave only true signals due to correctly hybridized and ligated target nucleic acids. (Mis-hybridizations occurs when hybridization does not produce a complementary structure of form of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>) In those direct labeling methods in which a reporter moiety becomes covalently attached to a probe bound to the surface of a UDA as a result of ligation, the highest stringency washes can be used. In those indirect labeling methods in which a reported moiety is attached to a strand of 24-54 bases, derived from ligation of a stacking oligomer to a strand of a target nucleic acid, hybridized to the bound probe, wash conditions are less stringent, in particular so as not to denature the 24-54 base pair double stranded nucleic acid. This double-stranded product is designed (the lengths and sequences of stacking oligomer and the probe core region) to be stable at least up to 55&deg; C. In contrast, all washes should be at least sufficiently stringent to denature all mis-hybridized target nucleic acids. As these consist of only 4-8 base pairs, they are not stable over 25-30&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Such probe, stacking oligomer, and target nucleic acid designs allow a UDA to achieve a high degree of mismatch discrimination, and therefore specific and reliable recognition of short terminal subsequences. Other means for increasing hybridization specificity and reliability adapted to this invention includes an alternate enzyme-catalyzed step, preferably employing a DNA polymerase. DNA polymerases are known in the art as enzymes that incorporate, in a template-dependent manner, nucleotides to the free 3&prime;-end of a duplex nucleic acid fragment. The discrimination factor for extension by DNA polymerase was found to be equal to or higher than that for a ligase. See, e.g., Broude et al., 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A 91:3072-3076. Specifically, this invention is adaptable to the use of a DNA polymerase after the ligation step to increase specificity, or recognition of hybridization mismatches, at locations more distant from the point of ligation. For example, using a DNA polymerase with labeled ddNTPs to extend the sequence of a stacking oligomer by a single base, determines the nucleotide adjacent to the end of the stacking oligomer from the signals from the ddNTPs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In a less preferred implementation of this invention, direct ligations are performed in the absence of a stacking oligomer. In this case, stacking interactions still occur at the end of one strand of a target nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the process details of the hybridization/ligation method, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> illustrates the hybridized nucleic acid structure (in general the &ldquo;hybridization structure&rdquo;) created according to this method. This structure includes target nucleic acid <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, probe <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, and stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. Target nucleic acid <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> includes hybridized strands <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> with single-stranded terminus <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, label moiety <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight> (in the case of &ldquo;direct labeling&rdquo;). Hybridization region <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> of probe <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> is complementary and therefore hybridized with single-stranded terminus <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>. Probe <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> is anchored to a discrete cell in a planar array by a chemical interaction (preferably a covalent interaction) between a schematically-represented, surface derivitization moiety <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and functional group <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight>, which is conjugated to oligomer <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>. To permit ligation, the oligomers used herein have appropriate 5&prime;-phosphates, in particular at nucleotide <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> on probe <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> and at nucleotide <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> of target nucleic acid strand <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. Stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> has a sequence complementary to core region <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> of probe oligomer <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, and thereby hybridizes adjacent to hybridization region <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>. Stacking interaction occur across the nicks <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. Activity of a nucleic acid ligase enzyme then joins the two nucleic acid strands at nicks <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, resulting in the covalent attachment of target strand <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>, with label moiety <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>, to the probe oligomer and of the target strand <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> to stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the probe oligomers that have recognized single-stranded termini in the nucleic acid sample become labeled with the label moiety on the target nucleic acid. This labeling (termed herein &ldquo;direct&rdquo; labeling) by which the probe oligomers attached to the substrate become labeled, is the preferred labeling mode. Following ligation, a very high stringency wash can be employed to remove all nucleic acids other than the covalently attached probes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> An alternative labeling (termed herein &ldquo;passive&rdquo; labeling) conjugates label moiety <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to stacking oligonucleotide <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>. Then, upon ligation, ligated strands <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, which are hybridized to ligated strands <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, become labeled with moiety <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. Following ligation, a high stringency wash selectively removes mis-hybridized or non-specifically bound nucleic acids from the UDA, while not disturbing hybridized ligated strands <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> resulting from correctly recognized target nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous for the conditions of the hybridization/ligation method (and also for the subsequently described SIL method) to be selected such that the UDA provides a quantitative signal of the amount of each species of target nucleic acid in a sample. To achieve such quantitative results, it is advantageous that the amount of hybridization/ligation product, and thus the detected hybridization, is approximately a linear function of the concentration of the target nucleic acid species, or is at least monotonically dependent upon this concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve such a dependence, first, the relative concentrations of probe and target are so adjusted as not to saturate or deplete either species during the hybridizations/ligations (and SIL) reactions. This is achieved by maintaining concentrations of unique probe oligomers in each cell of the array that are significantly higher (preferably 100 to 1000 fold molar excess) than the concentrations of any species of target nucleic acid. In comparison, the relative concentrations of any target species in solution is orders of magnitude lower, particularly in view of the fact that the target sample is a collection of several unique sequences, preferably, between 100-300. For this reason, even at rather high initial concentrations of the target mixture (1 pmol per hybridization/ligation reaction), the projected amount is approximately 10 fmol (&ldquo;femto-moles&rdquo;) or lower, for a single unique species in the interaction mixture. Further, the target is contained in a solution of 10 &mgr;l (as against the probes that are immobilized) thereby decreasing the effective concentration of the target species that is in the vicinity of a matched probe by a factor of approximately 100-1000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Second, it is advantageous that the target not become depleted during the hybridization and ligation, which would also hamper linear responsiveness. The hybridization/ligation (and SIL) reaction time is selected in view of such factors as, e.g., ligation efficiency, half life of enzyme activity, diffusion of target, depletion of reagents, etc. even for rare species in the target mixture in order that target species are not depleted during the reaction. In other words, the hybridization time is selected to be no longer than the time that expected target species become depleted by hybridization and ligation. Consequently, the amount of the hybridized and ligated target nucleic acid is approximately proportional to the initial concentration of the target. The less the target becomes depleted the more exact the proportionality. Therefore, the ligation occurs in an approximately linear range (called herein &ldquo;pseudo-linear&rdquo;), that in each cell is dependent upon the effective initial concentration of the target whose terminal sequence is complementary to the probe hybridization region. The same considerations apply and concentration ranges are selected for the SIL method, so that it too generates a hybridization signal proportional to the target nucleic acid concentrations. In view of ligation efficiencies, reaction times of the order of 1 to 12 hours (or more) can be appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> In alternative applications, a UDA may be required only to confirm the presence or absence of particular terminal subsequences in a test sample, without indicating their relative abundances. In this case, the hybridization and ligation conditions are preferably chosen so that all available target nucleic acids are observed by the UDA. Therefore, here it is also desirable to have an excess of probe molecules over target nucleic acids (in order to drive hybridization and ligation to substantial completion). However, here, it is desirable to perform the hybridization and ligations reactions until the target nucleic acids are substantially depleted by being bound to the UDA. One of average skill will appreciate how to manipulate the kinetic parameters of the hybridization/ligation reactions to achieve desirable results for yet other applications. The same choices and considerations apply to a similar application of the SIL method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> illustrates the method steps of the hybridization/ligation method. Here, exemplary target nucleic acid <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is shown as containing a 4 base single-stranded 5&prime; terminus with sequence TGTC. During a first hybridization step, target <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> anneal with anchored probe oligomer <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> containing the terminal 4 base single-stranded 5&prime; subsequence GACA, which is complementary to TGTC, to form double-stranded nucleic acid structure <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>. Typically, hybridization occurs in a total volume of 10 &mgr;l (placed over a UDA of 1.8 cm&times;1.8 cm size and covered by a cover slip) of a solution containing 1 pM of target nucleic acids, 10% PEG (M<highlight><subscript>w </subscript></highlight>6000), 66 mM Tris.Cl, 6.6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP and 40 mM NaCl (pH 7.5) at 25&deg; C. for 80 min. though nucleic acid <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> has no single-stranded gaps, it has two nicks indicated at arrows <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight>, at which stacking interactions occur and which are then ligated simultaneously with hybridization or during a second ligation step. Typically, ligation uses 400 units T4 DNA ligase. Preferably, the ligase is in the above solution and ligation occurs simultaneously with hybridization. A ligase enzyme concentration is chosen so that preferably further increases of enzyme concentration do not cause significantly increased ligation of hybridized target nucleic acids (i.e., the amount of hybridized targets reaches a constant plateau as ligase concentration is increased), and most preferably so that at this plateau substantially all (more than 90%) hybridized target is ligated. In a subsequent wash step, stringent wash conditions release the hybridized and ligated stacking oligomer leaving single stranded moiety <highlight><bold>629</bold></highlight>, which is labeled with the label attached to target nucleic acid. Since, preferably, a label is conjugated to the strand of the target nucleic acid now covalently attached to the probe, the stringent wash conditions can be such as are sufficient to denature and release all double-stranded nucleic acids. The detectable label remains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of direct labeling, UDAs are washed with 2 changes of 10 mM Tris.Cl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% SDS (TES) at higher than 80&deg; C. and preferably at higher than 90&deg; C. (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;very stringent&rdquo; wash). In the alternative passive labeling method, UDAs are washed by immersing in 0.5&times; SSPE/0.1%SDS for 15 min at a 50-55&deg; C. (hereinafter referred to as a stringent wash). After washing, the UDA with labeled oligomers is observed according to the methods of Section 5.2.5. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">5.2.4 Method of Strand-invasion Ligation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Another preferred method for using a universal detection array is strand invasion ligation (&ldquo;SIL&rdquo;). SIL is capable of recognizing not only single-stranded terminal subsequences of a target nucleic acid, as are recognized by hybridization/ligation, but is also capable of recognizing short double-stranded subsequences adjacent to the single-stranded overhangs. In contrast to h/l, which preferably generates a perfectly double-stranded structure with the target nucleic acid, the probe oligomer, and the stacking oligomer, SIL generates a double-stranded &ldquo;displacement&rdquo; structure. In this displacement structure, the hybridization region of the probe oligomer &ldquo;invades&rdquo; and hybridizes additionally with a short double-stranded portion of the target nucleic acid, &ldquo;displacing&rdquo; the corresponding strand of the target nucleic acid. The stacking oligomer hybridizes adjacent to the other strand of the target nucleic acid and is ligated to it with a ligase (T4 DNA ligase or Ampligase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, Wis.)). Ligase covalently joins the opposite strand via the 3&prime;-OH of the stacking oligonucleotide and the phosphorylated 5&prime;-single-stranded terminus of the target nucleic acid. In this method, the probe oligonucleotides are not covalently attached to target nucleic acid strands, since the displaced strand of the target nucleic acid cannot ligate to the end of the probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> illustrates the displacement structure (a form of a &ldquo;hybridization structure&rdquo;) created by SIL. The structure of the probe oligomer is described first. In strand invasion ligation, subsequence <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> contains bases that contact not only single-stranded terminus <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> but also additional bases in adjacent double-stranded subsequence <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight> of the target nucleic acid. Therefore, the structure of subsequence <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>, for the strand invasion implementation of this invention, differs from that for the h/l method in that it preferably contains two contiguous subsequences <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. Subsequence <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> is designed to hybridize with the double-stranded subsequence <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight> of the target. Its length in bases is equal to the number of nucleotides of double-stranded region contained in the target, which is preferably 2-4 nucleotides long. Subsequence <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> is designed to hybridize with single-stranded terminus <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, as with the h/l method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> SIL can be adapted to cases where the sequence of the double-stranded region is either unknown or known. In case the double-stranded region is unknown, both contiguous subsequences <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> are variable (a complete UDA then including probes with hybridization regions having all subsequences of the length of subsequence <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>) in order to recognize the entire unknown terminal subsequence of a nucleic acid. As an example, the overall length of the variable region of the probe, now determined together by the sum of the lengths of subsequences <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, can be 6 bases if the single-stranded region is 4 nucleotides and the double-stranded region is 2 nucleotides. In this case, a total array size of 46, or 4096, probe oligomers is used for interrogation of DNA bases contained in the target population. Probe arrays of increasing complexities are used for other alternative implementations, where the lengths of the overhangs, and/or double stranded regions are greater than the specific case illustrated here. Simultaneous hybridization with target single-stranded, terminal subsequences as well as with adjacent double-stranded subsequences of target nucleic acids distinguishes the SIL method of this invention from the h/l method, which recognizes only with single-stranded terminal subsequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Alternately, the double-stranded region can have an entirely or partially known sequence. Here, probe oligomers are designed to contact not only the variable single-stranded terminal subsequence but also the known nucleotides of the double-stranded subsequence. Recognition of known nucleotides imparts additional hybridization stability to the displacement structure. In this case, more stringent washing conditions can be used to distinguish specific form non-specific hybridization or mis-hybridization. Probe <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight> for this embodiment contains an additional constant region <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> that preferably hybridizes to known nucleotides of the double-stranded region. This region is preferably between 2 to 8 bases, and most preferably 5 bases long. The sequence of region <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> is complementary to the known double-stranded sequence. The overall number of the probes comprising an array and the total size of the array is still determined by the sum of the lengths of regions <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, since the sequence of region <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight> is fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> illustrates in more detail the displacement structure, which is created during the hybridization step of the SIL method. This structure includes target nucleic acid <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, probe oligomer <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, and stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. Target oligomer <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> includes hybridized strands <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> with single-stranded terminus <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, adjacent double-stranded subsequence <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>, and label moiety <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight> (in the case of &ldquo;direct labeling&rdquo;). Single stranded terminus <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> is complementary to and hybridized with subsequence <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> of hybridization region <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> of probe <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. The probe is anchored to a discrete cell in a UDA by a chemical interaction between a schematically represented, surface derivitization moiety <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> and functional group <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> conjugated to oligomer <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. To permit ligation, target strand <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> used herein has 5&prime;-phosphate <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>. Additionally, subsequence <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> of hybridization region <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> of the probe invades into and forms complementary base pairs with the formerly double-stranded subsequence <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight> of the target nucleic acid. A displacement structure is thereby created, in which subsequence <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight> of strand <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> of target nucleic acid is displaced by invading probe hybridization region <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>. Only nick <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is a ligation site <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, since subsequence <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight> is unable to ligate to the end of hybridization region <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>. Base stacking interactions occur at nick <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, and also at the end of subsequence <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> of the probe with the junction of displaced subsequence <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight> with strand <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> of the target nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> A ligase enzyme then ligates the two nucleic acid strands at nick <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, resulting in the covalent attachment of strand <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> of target nucleic acid <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, containing label moiety <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> (in the case of &ldquo;passive labeling&rdquo;). Thereby, the probe oligomers that have recognized both the single- and the adjacent double-stranded subsequences of the target nucleic acid can become labeled with label moiety <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight> on strand <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> of the target nucleic acid (&ldquo;direct labeling&rdquo;), or label moiety <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> on the stacking oligomer (&ldquo;passive labeling&rdquo;), or with both label moieties. Either one or both labels can be used; the preferred labeling places the label on the most stably hybridized strand. Since strand <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> of the target nucleic acid cannot be hybridized more stably to the probe than the ligated target nucleic acid strand <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, which links the former strand to the probe, it is preferred to at least label the stacking oligomer with label moiety <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> (passive labeling). A final washing step, which is to remove mis-hybridized and non-specifically hybridized fragments, is chosen to have a stringency that does not denature the ligated stacking oligomer from the probe. (Mis-hybridizations occurs when hybridization does not produce a complementary structure of form of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> illustrates the steps of the SIL method. Exemplary target nucleic acid <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is illustrated as including <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> nucleotide single-stranded subsequence <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, having the sequence 5&prime;-CGTC, and 4 nucleotide double-stranded subsequence <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>, having the sequence 5&prime;-ACCA. During a first hybridization step, target nucleic acid <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> with a FAM label anneal with anchored probe <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> containing an 8 nucleotide hybridization region having the sequence 5&prime;-TGGTGACG to form displacement structure <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight>. The terminal nucleotides 5&prime;-TGGT of probe <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> invade into and base pair with complementary nucleotides ACCA on strand <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, simultaneously displacing the terminal nucleotides 5&prime;-TGGT on the other strand of the target nucleic acid. The displacement structure <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> is then subject to the action of a ligase enzyme in order to link the termini of stacking oligomer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and strand <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> of the target nucleic acid, which has the terminal sequence 5&prime;-ACCACTGC. Conditions for the hybridization and ligation reactions can be as described previously for the h/l method. In particular, concentrations and other conditions of the hybridization and the ligation are chosen as described in the previous section so that the hybridization signal is proportional to the initial concentrations of target nucleic acid species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> In the strand invasion ligation method, UDAs are washed twice by immersing in 0.5&times; SSPE/0.1%SDS for 15 min at 50&deg; C. (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;mild&rdquo; wash). The washing conditions must be sufficiently stringent to denature partial duplexes containing unligated stacking oligomers, but not so stringent that stacking oligomers ligated to target nucleic acids are denatured. After washing, the UDA with labeled oligomers is observed according to the methods of Section 5.2.5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> The SIL method are adaptable to alternate methods for performing ligations. For instance, Ampligase, a thermostable DNA Ligase (Epicentre, Madison, Wis.) catalyzes the NAD-dependent ligation of adjacent 3&prime;-hydroxyl and 5&prime;-phosphate termini in duplex DNA structures at elevated temperatures, at least approximately 45&deg; C. In general, the upper limit on reaction temperatures with Ampligase DNA Ligase is determined by the Tm of the DNA substrate. Under such conditions of maximal hybridization stringency, non-specific ligation is significantly reduced. For these reasons Ampligase is advantageously employed in the present invention for the Strand Invasion ligation implementation by raising the ligation temperature to 45&deg; C. In this system, good discrimination is obtained at mismatched positions further away from the site of ligation as compared to conventional SIL implementation with T4 DNA ligase. Further, the correlation between increase in ligation temperature and discrimination is solely related to hybridization thermodynamics and not enzyme activity. Such higher ligation temperature are less preferable in the h/l method because the shorter region of hybridization (typically 4-5 nucleotides in the case of the h/l method, instead of at least 6-7 nucleotides in the case of the SIL method) is more susceptible to denaturation and these higher temperatures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.2.5 Signal Detection and Processing </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> The final step in utilizing a universal detection array for quantitatively recognizing terminal subsequences in a sample of nucleic acids is detecting the hybridization signals that result from hybridization of a UDA according to the previously described methods. This subsection describes preferred laser-based optical detection methods along with certain, primarily chemical, alternative methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> After a UDA is exposed to a sample of nucleic acids according to the method of hybridization/ligation or of strand-invasion ligation (thereby becoming a &ldquo;hybridized UDA&rdquo;), the location in the array and intensity of hybridization of target nucleic acids with probes of the UDA are detected. The location of hybridization determines the terminal subsequences recognized. Correlation of the location of a cell having a hybridization signal with the layout according to which probes were deposited or synthesized on the array determines the sequence of the hybridization region of the probes in that cell, and consequently, the sequence of complementary terminal subsequences of target nucleic acids hybridizing in that cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> The intensity of the hybridization signal, preferably, determines the quantitative abundance of that target nucleic acid species. First, the amount of hybridized target nucleic acid depends on the original concentration of that target nucleic acid, because as described with respect to the hybridization methods, the array is preferably hybridized in a pseudo-linear region, which is defined by the intensity of the hybridization signal being proportional to the initial concentrations of the nucleic acid species. Therefore, the intensity of the hybridization signal determines relative quantitative abundances of target nucleic acid species, because additionally detection methods preferably generate a hybridization signal that depends on the amount of hybridized target nucleic acid. Optionally, concentration standards of known sequences can be added to the target sample to provide a reference by which absolute abundance of target nucleic acid species can be determined from the relative abundance signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the preferred optical signal detection methods determine the location and relative quantitative intensity of hybridization signals from an array. In a preferred embodiment, the optical signals are generated from fluorescent moieties which are conjugated to the target nucleic acid species (in direct labeling embodiments) or to the stacking oligomers (in passive labeling embodiments). Typically, a laser of the appropriate emission wavelength stimulates the fluorescent moieties, and the resulting fluorescence is observed by a microscope. The use of two spectrally distinguishable fluorescent dyes is advantageous for the simultaneous observation of two directly labeled samples of target nucleic acids. Using a different dye on each sample, together with hybridization of a UDA with both samples simultaneously, permits direct comparisons of nucleic acid abundance between the two samples. This is useful for differential gene expression observations, genotype analysis, or diagnostic tests, for example where a patient is compared to a control or to the same patient in a previous state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> A UDA is adaptable to most types of fluorescent dyes that can be conjugated to nucleic acids. Succinimidyl esters of carboxy fluoresceins, such as FAM, are preferred. However, the invention is immediately adaptable to such fluorescent dyes as bimane, ethidium, europium (III) citrate, fluorescein, La Jolla blue (Diatron, Miami, FLA.), methyl-coumarin, nitro-benzofuran, pyrene butyrate, rhodamine, terbium chelate, tetramethyl-rhodamine, acridine, psoralen, and aminocoumarin, as well as more specialized fluorescent dyes listed in Table 12 in Section 6.7. (Both absorption and emission maximums are listed for each dye). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Another class of dyes advantageously used in the present invention are fluorescence resonance energy transfer dyes (hereinafter called &ldquo;FRET&rdquo; dyes). FRET dye emission results when a donor fluorophore moiety, excited by a light source, transfers its excitation energy to an acceptor fluorophore moiety, which then emits a visible photon. FRET dyes can be detected by emission of the acceptor moiety, or alternatively, by quenching of the donor moiety. The energy transfer is distance-dependent, and its efficiency decreases with increasing distance (dropping off beyond approximately 10-100 angstroms). Since FRET dyes provide fluorescence emission of intensity comparable to or greater than that of other fluorescent dyes, such dyes can be advantageously used in this invention for any fluorescent labeling moiety. See, e.g., Ju et al., 1996, Nuc. Acids Res. 24:1144-1148. Further, since FRET dyes are advantageous for investigating distance dependent effects in nucleic acids, the donor and acceptor moieties can be placed on different oligomers of this invention to indicate that a fluorescence signal comes from correctly configured nucleic acids. See, e.g., Mergny et al., 1996, Nuc. Acids Res. 22:920-928. For example, a donor can be placed on a probe and an acceptor on a stacking oligomer in order to indicate that a fluorescence signal originates only from correctly and specifically hybridized stacking oligomers. Any pair of FRET dyes suitable to conjugation of oligomers can be adapted to this invention. Many non-FRET dyes can be used in a FRET mode. For example, FAM can act as a donor for such acceptor dyes as FAM, JOE, TAMRA, and ROX. Exemplary FRET dyes are listed in Table 13 in Section 6.7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Preferably, emission from fluorescent dye labels on a hybridized UDA is stimulated by scanning the UDA with a laser having a wavelength and intensity chosen in view of the properties of the fluorescent dye(s) chosen. In an exemplary embodiment, an argon-krypton laser together with filters for emission at 488, 568, or 647 nm can be used. The filter at 488 3 nm is employed to detect the preferred fluorophore FAM, which has an absorption maximum at 492 nm and emission maximum at 515 nm (at a pH of approximately 9.0). Alternatively, ROX, with an absorption maximum at 568 nm, or Cy5, with an absorption maximum at 675 nm can be used. Alternatively, an ultraviolet excitation line from a mercury arc lamp with emission at 364 nm can be used together with such fluorescent dyes as acridine, psoralen, or aminocoumarin. Laser intensity is preferably not such that excessive scattered laser light is detected. Optionally, narrow-band rejection filters can be used. UDA conditions during laser scanning are optimized for the particular dyes used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Fluorescent signals generated from the hybridized UDA are detected using a microscope, preferably a confocal microscope. An exemplary embodiment uses a Zeiss model LSM 410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, N.Y.), an argon-krypton laser and appropriate emission filters, and a means for recording an image of emission stimulated from a UDA. Image recording can be provided by a transmitted light camera, such as e.g., a Zeiss Axiovert 135, Carl Zeiss Inc., or image-recording electronics, including charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras (Akhavan-Tafti et al., 1994, J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 9:155-164), cooled CCD cameras (Martin et al., 1994, J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 9:145-153), image intensifiers coupled to CCD cameras, or a photo-multiplier tube coupled with mechanical raster scanning (Pease et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91(11):5022-5026). Additionally, the same Zeiss LSM 410 system can be used for simultaneous collection of signals from two spectrally distinguishable fluorescence dyes. Spectral information generated in the form of emitted photons is captured, preferably in a linear range, by photomultiplier tubes (PMT), one PMT being optimized to collect information from each of the excited dyes. The collected information is stored and transferred electronically in the form of images of an appropriate the file format. Alternatively, a Biorad MRC 600 confocal microscope mounted on a Zeiss Axio-skop and equipped with a motorized focus attachment together with an argon laser and appropriate emission filter can be used for detection of signals stimulated from a UDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> The final detection step involves processing the observed images in order to extract quantitative hybridization information from each cell of the images of the hybridized UDA. Such processing is advantageously performed with computer-implemented image processing software. Film or slide images of the hybridized UDA can be scanned into an image file using readily available computer scanners, such as ps MD-4000 (ps Electric, San Jose, Calif.). Images directly captured electronically can be made available in an image file format by the electronic camera software. Preferred image file formats include the RAW, TIFF, PICT, or BMP formats. In an optional first processing step, images are standardized into a specified file format, such as TIFF using the Adobe Photoshop 4.0 program (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, Calif.), or an equivalent image processing program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In a second processing step, hybridization signals are quantitated from the images by a program capable of normalizing and measuring image characteristics. In particular, integrated signal intensities are individually determined from all cell of the UDA. In view of the preceding method steps, these integrated intensities are preferably substantially proportional to the initial concentrations of the target nucleic acid species. Thereby, the integrated intensity from and the location of the cells allow determination of the relative initial concentrations of the target nucleic acid species as determined by their recognized terminal subsequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Preferable facilities for a program adaptable to this second step include image adjustment features such as contrast enhancement, density profiling, smoothing, sharpening, edge detection, median filtering, spatial convolution with user defined kernels, and so forth, image measurement features such as finding image feature area, mean, centroid, perimeter, density, integrated density, and so forth, and calibration capability for size and density. A preferred program for this second step is ImagePC, available from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, Md.). In particular detailed information about ImagePC and its applications is available by anonymous FTP from the directory/pub/nih-image/documents at the Internet address zippy.nimh.nih.gov. Preferably, image processing programs have the capability for spectrally resolving colors which have been stored in independent or pseudo-independent color planes recorded from emissions of separate fluorescent dyes. Such color processing abilities include implementations for passing the collimated fluorescence collected from a cell through a multi-element bandpass filter for selection of discrete wavelength regions from the emitted fluorescence (Kostichka et al., 1992, Bio/Technology 10:78-81). The light then passes through a wedge prism, whereby each of the wavelength regions is diverted angularly to a different direction. This diverted light is collected by another camera lens, that produces a single image on the CCD for each of the wavelength regions selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Further, the invention is adaptable to the use of other reporter moieties for optical signal generation, such as biotin, digoxigenin, chemiluminescent assay, metal ions, and so forth. These methods are preferred in the case where the UDA is arrayed on other than a planar surface, such as, for example, by being configured in the wells of a microtiter plate. Detection methods for biotin or digoxigenin offer the advantages of amplification of the hybridization signal, and are preferred for the detection of rare species of targets in the subsample. Biotin can be detected by complexing with avidin or streptavidin that is coupled preferably to a fluorescent tag, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or by complexing with enzymes such as horse radish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. Such enzymes are visualized by in situ enzymatic assays known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning B A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York (1989). Digoxigenin can be detected by reaction with a suitable antibody that is coupled either to FITC or by conjugation to an enzyme, such as horse radish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase as just described for biotin. Chemiluminescent labels are attached by incorporation during synthesis and are assayed by enzymatic detection. Metal ions are detected using a wave guide (Stimpson et al., 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:6379-6383). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">6.1.2 Subsample Preparation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Subsamples can be prepared from original samples of cDNA or other nucleic acids according to the following preferred protocol. Preferably, protocols for subsample preparation enhance reproducibility and specificity by reducing or eliminating such individual manipulations as buffer changes, precipitations, or organic (phenol/chloroform) extractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Initially, a sample of de-phosphorylated cDNA (or other nucleic acid sample) is separated into batches of from 1 ng to at least 50 ng cDNA each. The number of batches is at least equal to the number of fragment subsamples (each deriving from original nucleic acids having different, specified primary subsequences) necessary for the desired degree of coverage. Advantageously, subsample preparation can be duplicated or triplicated for increased confidence, in which case additional batches are needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred protocol, primary subsequences are recognized as the recognition sites of Type II REs, and RE digestion proceeds simultaneously with adapter ligation. An amount of RE enzyme is specified in the protocols that is sufficient for complete digestion while minimizing other enzymatic exo- or endo-nuclease activity. Preferred and alternate RE combinations can be found in Tables 11 to 14 of PCT Publication WO 97/15690. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> Adapters are chosen that are uniquely capable of hybridizing with the single-stranded terminal subsequences (&ldquo;RE overhang&rdquo;) generated by each RE in a subsample preparation reaction. Adapters are composed of a hybridized linker and primer strands. The linker strand is complementary to one unique RE overhang in a reaction, and the primer strand is at least partially complementary to one linker strand in a reaction. Where a Type IIS restriction endonuclease enzyme participates in recognizing the additional subsequence, one primer has an appropriately placed Type IIS RE recognition site and a label moiety. In this case, the other primer in a subsample reaction has a conjugated capture moiety, such as, e.g., biotin, to provide for purification of Type IIS digested fragments for subsequence UDA hybridization. Exemplary fluorescent label moieties are listed Section 6.11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> In the general case, possible primer, linker, and Type II RE combinations are listed in Table 4 of Section 6.1.3. In the preferred case where additional subsequence recognition depends on digestion by a Type IIS RE, preferred primer-linker combinations are slightly modified from those of Table 4. Exemplary primer-linker combinations are described in Table 7 of Section 6.2. The preferred protocol for subsample preparation proceeds by first, hybridizing primers and linkers to form adapters, by second, digesting and ligating a batch of the initial sample, and by third, PCR amplifying the digestion/ligation produces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> Primer-excess Adapter Hybridization </paragraph>

The primers-linkers listed are adaptable to possible combinations of approximately 56 available REs generating a 5&prime;4 bp overhang. There are at least 40 such REs available from New England Biolabs. For a subsample preparation reaction, one primer and one linker from the &ldquo;R&rdquo; series corresponding to one of the pair of REs and one primer and one linker from the &ldquo;J&rdquo; series corresponding to the other of the pair of REs are used together. Two pairs from the same series are not compatible during amplification. Conjugated at the 5&prime;-end of the adapters is a biotin capture moiety or a fluorescent label moiety as needed for the subsequence determination of the available subsequences.

<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> When a UDA is used to recognized the additional subsequence, the nucleic acid fragments need a terminal single-stranded subsequence. The preferred protocol for determining the additional subsequence uses Type-IIS restriction enzymes to generate such single-stranded terminal subsequences. The digestion step uses a fluorescently (e.g., FAM) labelled primer having appropriately placed Type-IIS RE recognition sites. This primer is designed so that cleavage of the amplified products with the Type-IS enzyme leaves a terminal subsequence, including a 5&prime;-end overhang of 4 or 5 nucleotides. One to three nucleotides of the adjacent double-stranded subsequence can also be recognized by a UDA according to the strand-invasion method. The other primer has a conjugated capture moiety (e.g., biotin) to facilitate purifying the fragments for hybridization with a UDA. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> Table 5 lists exemplary Type IIS REs adaptable to this embodiment of the instant invention along with certain important characteristics. For each RE, the table lists the recognition sequence on each strand of a dsDNA molecule and the distance in bp from that recognition sequence to the location of strand cutting. so listed is the length of the overhang generated.

<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> The additional restriction endonucleases, BcgI, CjeI, and CjePI listed in Table 6 are also adaptable to this invention. Since they have properties unlike the Type II REs listed in Table 5, they are separately listed in Table 6. In particular, these REs cleave double stranded DNA in both direction from the recognition sequences, so that short fragments are released having single-stranded terminal subsequences on both ends.

<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> The choice of primers and linkers where Type IIS enzymes are used is similar to the previously described general case. Referring to Table 4, each subsample preparation reaction requires one primer/linker combination from the &ldquo;R&rdquo; series appropriate for one of the REs used in the reaction and one primer/linker combination from the &ldquo;J&rdquo; series appropriate for the other RE used. However, the R-series primer is modified so that a biotin moiety is conjugated at or near the 5&prime;-end. Importantly, the J-series primer is modified to have an appropriate Type IIS recognition site at an appropriate location. The corresponding linker must be similarly modified to be complementary any overlapping modification to the primer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> Table 7 lists exemplary J-series primers having Type IIS RE recognition sites adaptable to the subsample preparation reactions previously described. They satisfy the requirements on primers previously described in Section 5.1, and are all designed for subsample preparation reactions using Type II REs producing 4 bp single-stranded overhangs. Exemplary linkers and associated Type II REs and included for the primers. In view of these tables, modification of the additional linkers listed in Table 4 to these, and to other primers with recognition sites for different Type IIS enzymes, will be apparent to one of average skill.

<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> After the subsample preparation reactions, nucleic acid fragments are first bound to immobilized binding partners for the capture moieties conjugated to the nucleic acid fragments by virtue of the use of primers with such capture moieties. It is preferred that the capture moiety by biotin and that the immobilized binding partner by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Next, the bound fragments are digested with a Type IIS Restriction enzyme, which releases the fragments with single-stranded terminal subsequence ready for sequence analysis, by, e.g., hybridization to a UDA. </paragraph>

The spacer region is either absent, (T)<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, or (T)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>. The linker is C<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>with an amino functional group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> Probes were synthesized by and purchased from Biosynthesis, Inc., (Lewisville, Tex.) according to the standard synthetic (e.g., phosphoramidite) protocols. The linker with the amino group were introduced at appropriate steps during synthesis according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol (using the reagent N-trifluoroacetyl-6-aminohexyl-2-cyanoethyl N&prime;,N&prime;-diisopropyl-phosphoramidite). After synthesis, the probes were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their concentrations were determined by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> Before deposition, probes were dissolved in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) at concentrations of 2 &mgr;M to 20 mM and arranged in standard 384 well plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> Depositing the Probes on the Glass Surface </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> Manual and robotic methods were used to transfer the probe solutions onto the derivitized glass surface. Manual transfer, used preferably when the total array size was small (less than 20-25 cells total) such as for a test grid, was done by touching the surface of the slide either with blunt-ended needle tips or with pipette tips that had been dipped in the appropriate solution of the appropriate probes. A slide to be arrayed was placed on a paper template containing a grid that served as a guide for locating the position of cells. For identification of the coordinates of each cell in the array, additional alignment marker cells were deposited (in both the manual and robotic methods) with the FAM-labeled probes at controlled positions in and around the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> Robotic methods were used for arrays of greater complexity, such as 256-arrays or higher. These methods used robot means including an X-Y-Z table and a moveable print head. A custom made such robot, obtained from T-Tech, Inc. (Atlanta, Ga.), contained a platform that could move in X and Y directions and a printing head that could move in X, Y, and Z directions, both device capable of 3 micrometer precision. The platform had four work stations: a 384 well sample plate containing probe solutions and marker probe solutions, a washing station with a deionized water reservoir for washing the depositing needles (alternately pins can be used), a drying station with paper tissues to dry the washed needles by physical contact, and a work area that could accommodate up to nine glass slides in a single deposition operation. The printing head consisted of up to 4 depositing needles, 30 gauge size &frac12; in. large with luer hub, Cat. &num;NE-301PL, Small Parts, Inc. (Miami Lakes, Fla.), and is adaptable to accommodate more needles. In the examples reported herein, arrays were deposited using blunt-ended hollow stainless steel needles. However, the invention is equally adaptable for using other arraying implements including but not limited to capillary tubes, micro-fabricated needles and pins, piezoelectric printing modes, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> Before depositing, or arraying, an array, the T-Tech robot was appropriately programmed by a sequence of stored commands to follow a sequence of steps, such as, collecting oligomer solution from a source well, delivering to an appropriate destination position on a glass slide, followed by appropriate number of washing and drying steps before commencing the next iteration of dipping into a different source well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> The protocol for deposition of probes on glass surface using the T-tech machine is set forth below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> 1) Before deposition, probes deposition-solution were prepared by diluting or dissolved probes in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) at concentrations of 2 &mgr;M to 20 mM and arranged in standard 384 well microtiter plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> 2) Needles take up probe solutions by capillary effect upon being dipped into sample solutions stored in a 384 well microtiter plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> 3) Probe solutions are deposited on derivitized glass slides by bringing the tip of the needles into contact with the slide surface. Each needle delivered a drop of oligomer solution of approximately 25 nl volume, creating a cell of approximately 200 &mgr;m diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> 4) Needles were dipped repeatedly into the same probe well, if more samples of that probe copies are to be deposited on a surface. Otherwise, before being dipped in another probe solution, needles were washed by immersing in a reservoir of deionized water for a few seconds followed by contacting with the tissues on the drying station to absorb the liquid from the needles for drying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> After depositing the probe solutions on a derivitized glass surface, the following processing protocol was performed to cause bonding of the probes to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> 1) Arrayed slides were incubated for 1 hr at 37&deg; C. in a petri dish containing a piece of Whatman &num;1 paper soaked in deionized H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (not in contact with the arrayed slide). During rehydration, the amino group modification on the probes reacted with the diisothiocyanate groups on modified glass surfaces and formed covalent bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> 2) The slides were then treated with 1% NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH for 2 minutes at room temperature followed by three washes with deionized H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> 3) Arrayed slides were stored in a vacuum desiccator and kept in dark at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> This arraying protocol was used to deposit the test arrays described subsequently. This protocol is suitable to construct arrays having up to 4096 probes and having the structure described in Section 5.2.2. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> Average hybridized cell intensity (third column) was estimated from 2 or 3 independent measurements of hybridization and normalized in view of the initial concentrations of each anchor oligomer used (between 13 and 20 pmols/&mgr;l) in order to obtain values for normalized intensity of hybridized cells (fourth column). The normalized intensities over the range of spacer lengths were comparable, suggesting equivalent hybridization efficiency for each of the oligomers. Under these deposition conditions, approximately 5% of the surface anchored probes were hybridized, which is comparable with values for hybridization efficiency obtained in similar implementations by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> In this example, synthetic DNA targets were used for hybridization to a test array. These targets resembled the structure of fragment samples prepared according to the methods of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, and were prepared by annealing a pair of complementary oligonucleotides. The complementary oligonucleotides JC24 (Table 4) and pMP6 shown below have a 24-base complementary region (underlined), and a duplex formed from the strands has a 5&prime;-FAM on one strand and a single-stranded 4 base 5&prime;-overhang, TGTC. on the other strand.

<paragraph id="P-0479" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0479&rsqb;</number> These results showed that, first, hybridization signals were obtained only from probes having a hybridization region complementary to the single-stranded terminal subsequence of the target nucleic acid. No signal was obtained from probe RHO1. Second, as observed for direct hybridization, the ligation efficiencies did not significantly vary with the length of the spacer alone. Accordingly, interactions of the probe and the target during ligation are less constrained by stearic effects due to probe length. The probe is more accessible to the DNA ligase enzyme than it is for direct hybridizations, which requires a more extensive interaction along the full length of the oligomer portion of the anchored probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0480" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0480&rsqb;</number> These conclusion are confirmed by additional results for hybridization/ligation performed according to the above protocol but with 100 fmol of target nucleic acids and stacking oligomers. (Again, probe concentrations of 20 &mgr;M were used in the deposition solutions.) Results for these concentration are set forth in Table 10.

<paragraph id="P-0481" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0481&rsqb;</number> The average ligation efficiency using 100 fmol target again did not vary significantly over the range of spacer lengths employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0482" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0482&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, ligation efficiencies varied with target concentration with 1 pmol or 100 fmol target and spacer length. Preferable results were found for the probe MP1 (having 5 T nucleotides). The ratio of average cell hybridization intensity for ligations with MP1 using a 10-fold range of (1 pmol: 100 fmol) target concentrations 2&deg; was 10.76. Thereby, among these three probes tested, MP1 is preferred for obtaining the most pseudo-linear hybridization signal response in this range of target concentrations. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0484" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0484&rsqb;</number> The effects of probe concentration in the probe deposition solution was tested by preparing an detection array from solutions of varying probe concentration. This array was then hybridized with target nucleic acids and the fluorescence signal intensity was observed. Solutions with probe concentrations varying over a 10,000 fold range, from 2 &mgr;M to 20 mM, each increment being 10 fold concentration change, were tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0485" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0485&rsqb;</number> Oligomer solutions representing an incremental range of initial concentrations were deposited and anchored on derivatized slides as described in Section 6.5, Probe Deposition Test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0486" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0486&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the array employed for the probe concentration test was prepared according to the protocols described in Section 6.4 with a cell diameter of approximately 300 &mgr;m and with a spacing between cells of approximately 750 &mgr;m in the four quadrants illustrated below (only quadrant 3 was of interest for this test).

The other axis records the probe deposition-solution concentration on a base 10 logarithm scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0496" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0496&rsqb;</number> In general, these results indicate that the intensities of hybridization signals observed from probe cells deposited with probe solution concentrations of 2 &mgr;M are comparable to the intensities observed from cells deposited with probe solution concentrations of 20 mM (which the prior art teaches as approximately optimal). Signal intensity at 20 mM is only a little more than 2-fold greater than at 2 &mgr;m. In detail, there was a 2-fold decrease in the signal intensity as probe deposition-solution concentration increased from 2 &mgr;M to 200 &mgr;M (100-fold increase), followed by a 4.5-fold increase as probe deposition-solution concentration increased from 200 &mgr;M to 20 mM (another 100-fold increase). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0497" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0497&rsqb;</number> In summary, the use of probe deposition-solution concentrations of approximately 2 &mgr;M, or of approximately between 2 &mgr;M and 200 &mgr;M, gives adequate hybridization signal intensity and requires considerably less probe than the use of probe deposition-solution concentrations above 200 &mgr;M and up to 20 mM (as taught in the prior art). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0498" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0498&rsqb;</number> The inventors believe that these results are explained either by stearic effects, which hinder hybridization as probe densities increase, or by small changes in ligation efficiency accompanying varying probe concentrations. The latter effects have been demonstrated for ligations of foreign DNA to linearized plasmid DNA (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989<highlight><italic>, Molecular Cloning B A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York). </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0522" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0522&rsqb;</number> An exemplary search was performed of sequence databases in order to find cDNAs containing pairs of primary subsequences, which were selected from the recognition sequences of Type II REs. As additional pairs of REs were selected, additional cDNAs were found. The cumulative percentage of found cDNAs versus the number of pairs of REs is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. This figure represents the percent coverage of a sample of nucleic acids derived from cDNAs that can be expected from the indicated number of subsamples produced by the selected REs according to the protocols of Section 6.1.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0523" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0523&rsqb;</number> These searches were performed by software according to the methods described in Section 5.1.3.
