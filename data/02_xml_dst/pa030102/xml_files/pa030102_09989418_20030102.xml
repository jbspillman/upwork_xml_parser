<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a CRT display apparatus, particularly relates to a CRT display apparatus having a normal-contrast-display mode and a high-contrast-display mode. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-167965, it is known to apply a video signal to not only a cathode but also a grid electrode within an electron gun of a CRT to display brighter images in a CRT display apparatus. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the structure of the video drive circuit of the CRT display apparatus disclosed in this Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-167965. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In this figure, a video signal is input directly into a non-inverting amplifier <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and an inverting amplifier <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through an input terminal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The video signal of negative polarity output from the non-inverting amplifier <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is amplified by a video output amplifier <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> while maintaining its polarity and thereafter applied to a cathode electrode <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of a CRT <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the video signal of positive polarity output from the inverting amplifier <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is amplified by a video output amplifier <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> while maintaining its polarity and thereafter applied to a grid electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the CRT <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. As described above, the CRT display apparatus attains high brightness display by applying video signals having different polarities to the cathode electrode and the grid electrode respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a graph showing a relationship between an amplitude of an input video signal and a brightness of a screen in a display apparatus including a video drive circuit having a structure as described above and a CRT whose &ggr; value is 2.0. The x axis represents amplitude of an input signal and y axis represents brightness. In this graph, the brightness of the screen when an input video signal whose amplitude is at 100% is applied only to the cathode is defined as 100%. A curve C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> represents an amplitude-brightness characteristic when a video signal is applied only to the cathode, and a curve C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> represents an amplitude-brightness characteristic when the same video signal is applied to the cathode and the grid. It is apparent from this graph that, if the cathode and the grid are applied with the same video signal, the brightness is at 200% when the amplitude of this input video signal is at 100% which is twice the brightness (100%) in a case where only the cathode is applied with the video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> By using a video drive circuit having such a structure as described above, it is possible to double a maximum brightness. However, since the brightness increases for the whole range of the amplitude of an input video signal, a dark area corresponding to an input signal having an amplitude lower than 20% which is recognized to be at a gray level which is close to a black level if only the cathode is applied with an input video signal is not recognized to be at the gray level close to the black level if both of the cathode and the grid are applied with the input video signal because of increase of the brightness of this area. As a result, although the maximum brightness increases, the screen looks bleached as a whole, and accordingly the contrast is perceived to decline. Moreover, when the brightness of the dark area increases, noises within this area become conspicuous, whereby image quality is degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To avoid the decline of contrast and the degradation of image quality due to the noises within the dark area, it has been proposed to shift a voltage (a video signal amplitude) applied to the grid by a predetermined value, for example, to shift the voltage applied to the grid to such an extent that the brightness of an area corresponding to an input video signal having a 15% amplitude when the cathode and the grid are applied with the same video signal (referred to as &ldquo;cathode&plus;grid drive&rdquo; hereinafter) matches the brightness of the same area when only the cathode is applied with the video signal (referred to as &ldquo;cathode drive&rdquo; hereinafter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> curve C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> represents an amplitude-brightness characteristic when only the cathode is applied with a video signal, a curve C<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> represents an amplitude-brightness characteristic when both of the cathode and the grid are applied with the video signal, and a curve C<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> represents an amplitude-brightness characteristic when both of the cathode and the grid are applied with the video signal and the voltage level of the grid is shifted (referred to as &ldquo;cathode&plus;grid&plus;level-shift drive&rdquo; hereinafter). In the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, input video signals are plotted within 0% to 30% amplitude range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This graph shows that the brightness in the case of the cathode&plus;grid&plus;level-shift drive (C<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) is about the same as the brightness in the case of the cathode drive (C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) so far as an input video signal is within the 10% to 20% amplitude range, however it falls below zero when the input video signal has an amplitude less than 7%. It means that the brightness of any area corresponding to an input video signal having 7% amplitude or less is all brought to the black level, which causes halftone-reproduction degradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As described above, the conventional video drive circuit which attains high-brightness display by applying a video signal to both of the cathode and the grid to increase the maximum brightness involves the problem of contrast decline due to brightness increase in the areas which are at the gray level and close to the black level and image quality degradation due to the noises in the dark areas. Even if the provision for shifting the level of the voltage applied to the grid is made to avoid such problems, it causes another problem of causing halftone-reproduction degradation in the dark areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Besides, since the conventional video drive circuit has two different signal lines for supplying an input video signal to the inverting amplifier and the non-inverting amplifier individually, stray capacitance due to wiring is large compared with the case of supplying an input video signal only to the non-inverting amplifier, and its frequency response is therefore degraded. </paragraph>

The G-signal entering the G-output amplification circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the G-signal input terminal <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is amplified, and then supplied to the G-cathode electrode <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The G-signal from the G-signal input terminal <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> also enters the G-control signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Here, suppose that the waveform of the G-signal supplied to the G-cathode electrode is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(A). A maximum value of the amplitude of the waveform in this figure corresponds to the previously described 100% amplitude. The G-control signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates a G-control signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(B) by removing, from the G-signal, portions which are below a predetermined level (below 15% of the maximum amplitude, for example). This G-control signal is inverted and amplified by the G-control signal amplification circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to become a signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (C), and then input into the first input terminal of the G-contrast selection circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While the normal-contrast-display mode is selected, the G-contrast selection circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> selects the second input terminal so that the G-beam-ready G1 electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied with the G-normal-contrast effecting potential <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The input signal amplitude-brightness characteristic at this time is as shown by the curve C<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (the characteristic when only the cathode is applied with the video signal) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Since the brightness is normalized, the input signal amplitude-brightness characteristics for the R-, G-, and B-signals can be represented by the same curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, while the high-contrast-display mode is selected, the G-contrast selection circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> selects the first input terminal so that the G-beam-ready G1 electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is applied with the output of the G-control signal amplification circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The input signal amplitude-brightness characteristic at this time is as shown by the curve C<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, input video signals are plotted within 0% to 50% amplitude range. This characteristic matches the input signal amplitude-brightness characteristic in the normal-contrast-display mode represented by the curve C<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so far as the input video signal has an amplitude less than 15%. Accordingly, the brightness of the screen in the high-contrast-display mode is about the same as that in the normal-contrast-display mode for any dark area where the amplitude of the input video signal is less than 20%, and therefore, the halftone-reproduction degradation does not occur. On the other hand, the brightness in the high-contrast-display mode is larger than in the normal-contrast-display mode for any area where the amplitude of the input video signal is more than 20%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, with the CRT display apparatus according to the first example, it is possible to display images in high contrast and high brightness without causing noises or halftone-reproduction degradation within dark areas. Although the first example of the invention has three separate potentials of the R-normal-contrast effecting potential <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the G-normal-contrast effecting potential <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the B-normal-contrast effecting potential <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, they can be the same potential, an earth potential, for example. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The G-signal from the G-signal input terminal <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is also supplied to the input terminal of the frequency-response-degradation suppressing switch <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This switch <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is opened when the normal-contrast-display mode is selected, and closed when the high-contrast-display mode is selected. While the switch <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is closed, the G-signal is supplied to the G-control signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The G-control signal generation circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates a G-control signal by removing, from the G-signal, portions which are below a predetermined level (below 15% of the maximum amplitude, for example). The G-control signal amplification circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> inverts and amplifies this G-control signal. The signal output from the G-control signal amplification circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is input into the first input terminal of the contrast selection circuit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
