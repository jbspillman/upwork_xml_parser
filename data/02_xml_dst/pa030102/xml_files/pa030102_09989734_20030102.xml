<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the identification and isolation of novel DNA and to the recombinant production of novel polypeptides. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Extracellular proteins play important roles in, among other things, the formation, differentiation and maintenance of multicellular organisms. The fate of many individual cells, e.g., proliferation, migration, differentiation, or interaction with other cells, is typically governed by information received from other cells and/or the immediate environment. This information is often transmitted by secreted polypeptides (for instance, mitogenic factors, survival factors, cytotoxic factors, differentiation factors, neuropeptides, and hormones) which are, in turn, received and interpreted by diverse cell receptors or membrane-bound proteins. These secreted polypeptides or signaling molecules normally pass through the cellular secretory pathway to reach their site of action in the extracellular environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Secreted proteins have various industrial applications, including as pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, biosensors and bioreactors. Most protein drugs available at present, such as thrombolytic agents, interferons, interleukins, erythropoietins, colony stimulating factors, and various other cytokines, are secretory proteins. Their receptors, which are membrane proteins, also have potential as therapeutic or diagnostic agents. Efforts are being undertaken by both industry and academia to identify new, native secreted proteins. Many efforts are focused on the screening of mammalian recombinant DNA libraries to identify the coding sequences for novel secreted proteins.

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Membrane-bound proteins and receptors can play important roles in, among other things, the formation, differentiation and maintenance of multicellular organisms. The fate of many individual cells, e. g., proliferation, migration, differentiation, or interaction with other cells, is typically governed by information received from other cells and/or the immediate environment. This information is often transmitted by secreted polypeptides (for instance, mitogenic factors, survival factors, cytotoxic factors, differentiation factors, neuropeptides, and hormones) which are, in turn, received and interpreted by diverse cell receptors or membrane-bound proteins. Such membrane-bound proteins and cell receptors include, but are not limited to, cytokine receptors, receptor kinases, receptor phosphatases, receptors involved in cell-cell interactions, and cellular adhesin molecules like selectins and integrins. For instance, transduction of signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation is regulated in part by phosphorylation of various cellular proteins. Protein tyrosine kinases, enzymes that catalyze that process, can also act as growth factor receptors. Examples include fibroblast growth factor receptor and nerve growth factor receptor. </paragraph>

Leucine-rich repeats are short sequence motifs present in a number of proteins with diverse functions and cellular locations. The crystal structure of ribonuclease inhibitor protein has revealed that leucine-rich repeats correspond to beta-alpha structural units. These units are arranged so that they form a parallel beta-sheet with one surface exposed to solvent, so that the protein acquires an unusual, nonglubular shape. These two features have been indicated as responsible for the protein-binding functions of proteins containing leucine-rich repeats. See, Kobe and Deisenhofer, <highlight><italic>Trends Biochem.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The cloning of the Toll gene of Drosophila, a maternal effect gene that plays a central role in the establishment of the embryonic dorsal-ventral pattern, has been reported by Hashimoto et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>52:269-279 (1988). The Drosophila Toll gene encodes an integral membrane protein with an extracytoplasmic domain of 803 amino acids and a cytoplasmic domain of 269 amino acids. The extracytoplasmic domain has a potential membrane-spanning segment, and contains multiple copies of a leucine-rich segment, a structural motif found in many transmembrane proteins. The Toll protein controls dorsal-ventral patterning in Drosophila embryos and activates the transcription factor Dorsal upon binding to its ligand Sp&auml;tzle. (Morisato and Anderson, <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>76:677-688 (1994)). In adult Drosophila, the Toll/Dorsal signaling pathway participates in the anti-fungal immune response.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A human homologue of the Drosophila Toll protein has been described by Medzhitov et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>388:394-397 (1997). This human Toll, just as Drosophila Toll, is a type I transmembrane protein, with an extracellular domain consisting of 21 tandemly repeated leucine-rich motifs (leucine-rich region&mdash;LRR), separated by a non-LRR region, and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor. A constitutively active mutant of the human Toll transfected into human cell lines was shown to be able to induce the activation of NF-&kgr;B and the expression of NF-&kgr;B-controlled genes for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as the expression of the constimulatory molecule B7. 1, which is required for the activation of native T cells. It has been suggested that Toll functions in vertebrates as a non-clonal receptor of the immune system, which can induce signals for activating both an innate and an adaptive immune response in vertebrates. The human Toll gene reported by Medzhitov et al., supra was most strongly expressed in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), and the authors suggested that its expression in other tissues may be due to the presence of macrophages and dendritic cells, in which it could act as an early-warning system for infection. The public GenBank database contains the following Toll sequences: Toll1 (DNAX&num; HSU88540-1, which is identical with the random sequenced full-length cDNA &num;HUMRSC786-1); Toll2 (DNAX&num; HSU88878-1); Toll3 (DNAX&num; HSU88879-1); and Toll4 (DNAX&num; HSU88880-1, which is identical with the DNA sequence reported by Medzhitov et al., supra).

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Collagens constitute the most abundant proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in mammalian organisms. Collagen and other macromolecules of the ECM are deposited by resident cells and organized into a three-dimensional meshwork. This ECM environment plays an essential role in guiding cell migration and in cell-to-cell communication during morphogenic processes. The restructuring of the ECM during remodeling occurs as a cooperative multistep process involving a localized degradation of existing macromolecules, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, cell translocation, and deposition of new ECM components. Involved in this restructuring are enzymes such as collagenases and gelatinases which play important roles in the degradation of the ECM. In light of the obviously important roles played by the collagenase enzymes, there is substantial interest in identifying and characterizing novel polypeptides having homology to these proteins. We herein describe the identification and characterization of novel polypeptides having homology to human type IV collagenase protein, designated herein as PRO1063 polypeptides. </paragraph>

Type I interferons may be produced by most cell types.

Zhang et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>372, 425-431 (1994) have recently reported the cloning and sequencing of the mouse ob gene and its human homologue, and suggested that the ob gene product may function as part of a signaling pathway from adipose tissue that acts to regulate the size of the body fat depot. Parabiosis experiments performed more than 20 years ago predicted that the genetically obese mouse containing two mutant copies of the ob gene (ob/ob mouse) does not produce a satiety factor which regulates its food intake, while the diabetic (db/db) mouse produces but does not respond to a satiety factor.

This protein displays no sequence similarity to the leptin receptor itself. The authors found that the OB-RGRP gene shares its promoter and two exons with the OB-R gene, and suggested that there is a requirement for a coordinate expression of OB-R and OB-RGRP to elicit the full physiological response to leptin in vivo. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> All proteins containing leucine-rich repeats are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Leucine-rich repeats are short sequence motifs present in a number of proteins with diverse functions and cellular locations. The crystal structure of ribonuclease inhibitor protein has revealed that leucine-rich repeats correspond to beta-alpha structural units. These units are arranged so that they form a parallel beta-sheet with one surface exposed to solvent, so that the protein acquires an unusual, nonglubular shape. These two features have been indicated as responsible for the protein-binding functions of proteins containing leucine-rich repeats. See, Kobe and Deisenhofer, <highlight><italic>Trends Biochem. Sci., </italic></highlight>19(10):415-421 (Oct. 1994); Kobe and Deisenhofer, <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol., </italic></highlight>5(3):409-416 (1995). </paragraph>

I., et al., WO91 10727-A by La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation reporting that decorin binding to transforming growth factors has involvement in a treatment for cancer, wound healing and scarring. Related by function to this group of proteins is the insulin like growth factor (IGF), in that it is useful in wound-healing and associated therapies concerned with re-growth of tissue, such as connective tissue, skin and bone; in promoting body growth in humans and animals; and in stimulating other growth-related processes. The acid labile subunit of IGF (ALS) is also of interest in that it increases the half-life of IGF and is part of the IGF complex in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Another protein which has been reported to have leucine-rich repeats is the SLIT protein which has been reported to be useful in treating neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease, nerve damage such as in Parkinson&apos;s disease, and for diagnosis of cancer, see, Artavanistsakonas, S. and Rothberg, J. M., WO9210518-Al by Yale University. Of particular interest is LIG-1, a membrane glycoprotein that is expressed specifically in glial cells in the mouse brain, and has leucine rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains. Suzuki, et al., J. Biol. Chem. (U.S.), 271(37):22522 (1996).

<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The abbreviations &ldquo;TIE&rdquo; or &ldquo;tie&rdquo; are acronyms, which stand for &ldquo;tyrosine kinase containing Ig and EGF homology domains&rdquo; and were coined to designate a new family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are almost exclusively expressed in vascular endothelial cells and early hemopoietic cells, and are characterized by the presence of an EGF-like domain, and extracellular folding units stabilized by intra-chain disulfide bonds, generally referred to as &ldquo;immunoglobulin (IG)-like&rdquo; folds. A tyrosine kinase homologous cDNA fragment from human leukemia cells (tie) was described by Partanen et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>87, 8913-8917 (1990). The mRNA of this human &ldquo;TIE&rdquo; receptor has been detected in all human fetal and mouse embryonic tissues, and has been reported to be localized in the cardiac and vascular endothelial cells. Korhonen et al., <highlight><italic>Blood </italic></highlight>80, 2548-2555 (1992); PCT Application Publication No. WO 93/14124 (published Jul. 22, 1993). The rat homolog of human TIE, referred to as &ldquo;TIE-1&rdquo;, was identified by Maisonpierre et al., <highlight><italic>Oncogene </italic></highlight>8, 1631-1637 (1993)). Another TIE receptor, designated &ldquo;TIE-2&rdquo; was originally identified in rats (Dumont et al., <highlight><italic>Oncogene </italic></highlight>8, 1293-1301 (1993)), while the human homolog of TIE2, referred to as &ldquo;ork&rdquo; was described in U.S. Pat.

The murine homolog of TIE-2 was originally termed &ldquo;tek.&rdquo; The cloning of a mouse TIE-2 receptor from a brain capillary cDNA library is disclosed in PCT Application Publication No. WO 95/13387 (published May 18, 1995). TIE-2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed almost exclusively by vascular endothelium. Tie-2 knockout mice die by defects in the formation of microvassels. Accordingly, the TIE receptors are believed to be actively involved in angiogenesis, and may play a role in hemopoiesis as well. Indeed, recent results (Lin et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Invest. </italic></highlight>100(8), 2072-2078 &lsqb;1997&rsqb;) demonstrating the ability of a soluble TIE-2 receptor to inhibit tumor angiogenesis have been interpreted to indicate that TIE-2 plays a role in pathologic vascular growth. In another study, TIE-2 expression was examined in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis and in quiescent tissues. TIE2 expression was localized by immunohistochemistry to the endothelium of neovessels in rat tissues undergoing angiogenesis during hormonally stimulated follicular maturation and uterine development and in healing wounds. TIE-2 was also reported to be expressed in the entire spectrum of the quiescent vasculature (arteries, veins, and capillaries) in a wide range of adult tissues. Wong et al., <highlight><italic>Circ. Res. </italic></highlight>81(4), 567-574 (1997). It has been suggested that TIE-2 has a dual function in adult angiogenesis and vascular maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The expression cloning of human TIE-2 ligands has been described in PCT Application Publication No. WO 96/11269 (published Apr. 18, 1996) and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,073 (published May 28, 1996). A vector designated as &lgr;gt10 encoding a TIE-2 ligand NL7d &ldquo;htie-2 ligand 1&rdquo; or &ldquo;hTL1 has been deposited under ATCC Accession No. 75928. A plasmid encoding another TIE-2 ligand designated &ldquo;htie-2 2&rdquo; or &ldquo;hTL2&rdquo; is available under ATCC Accession No. 75928. This second ligand has been described as an antagonist of the TAI-2 receptor. The identification of secreted human and mouse ligands for the TIE-2 receptor has been reported by Davis et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>87, 1161-1169 (1996). The human ligand designated &ldquo;Angiopoietin-1&rdquo;, to reflect its role in angiogenesis and potential action during hemopoiesis, is the same ligand as the ligand variously designated as &ldquo;htie-21&rdquo; or &ldquo;hTL-1&rdquo; in WO 96/11269. Angiopoietin-1 has been described to play an angiogenic role later and distinct from that of VEGF (Suri et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>87, 1171-1180 (1996)). Since TIE-2 is apparently upregulated during the pathologic angiogenesis requisite for tumor growth (Kaipainen et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>54, 6571-6577 (1994)) angiopoietin-1 has been suggested to be additionally useful for specifically targeting tumor vasculature (Davis et al., supra). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is a membrane-bound protein that plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis, mediating cellular uptake of lipoprotein particles by high affinity binding to its ligands, apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 and apoE. The ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor contains 7 cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids, wherein each repeat contains 6 cysteines, which form 3 intra-repeat disulfide bonds. These unique structural features provide the LDL receptor with its ability to specifically interact with apo B-100 and apoE, thereby allowing for transport of these lipoprotein particles across cellular membranes and metabolism of their components. Soluble fragments containing the extracellular domain of the LDL receptor have been shown to retain the ability to interact with its specific lipoprotein ligands (Simmons et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:25531-25536 (1997)).

Numerous different protease enzymes from a variety of different mammalian and non-mammalian organisms have been both identified and characterized. The mammalian protease enzymes play important roles in many different biological processes including, for example, protein digestion, activation, inactivation, or modulation of peptide hormone activity, and alteration of the physical properties of proteins and enzymes. Thus, proteases are of interest. Also of interest are protease inhibitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Of particular interest are serine proteases. In one study it was reported that when the serine protease inhibitor antileukoproteinase (aLP) is injected, it accumulates in articular and extraarticular cartilage of normal rats. This physiological pathway of cartilage accumulation, lost in proteoglycan depleted arthritic cartilage is believed to serve to maintain the local balance between proteinase function and inhibition. Burkhardt, et al., <highlight><italic>J. Rheumatol, </italic></highlight>24(6): 1145-1154 (1997).

It has also been suggested that lectins such as conglutinin can function as immunoglobulin-independent defense molecules due to complement-mediated mechanisms. Thus, conglutinin has been shown to be useful for purifying immune complexes in vitro and for removing circulating immune complexes from patients plasma in vivo (Lim et al., <highlight><italic>Biochem.

Ion channels and the receptors which control these channels are responsible for the passage of ions, or nerve impulses to be communicated from cell to cell, thus, ion channels are responsible for communication. In addition to their critical role in the brain, ion channels play a critical role in the heart as well as blood pressure. Ion channels have also been linked to other important bodily functions and conditions, as well as disorders, such as cystic fibrosis. For all of these reasons, ion channels, such as sodium, potassium and chloride channels, as well as all of their related proteins and receptors are of interest. For example, it has been reported that cystic fibrosis results from a defect in the chloride channel protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. McGill, et al., <highlight><italic>Dig. Dis. Sci., </italic></highlight>41(3):540-542 (1996).

More generally, all novel membrane bound-proteins are of interest. Membrane-bound proteins and receptors can play an important role in the formation, differentiation and maintenance of multicellular organisms. The fate of many individual cells, e.g., proliferation, migration, differentiation, or interaction with other cells, is typically governed by information received from other cells and/or the immediate environment. This information is often transmitted by secreted polypeptides (for instance, mitogenic factors, survival factors, cytotoxic factors, differentiation factors, neuropeptides, and hormones) which are, in turn, received and interpreted by diverse cell receptors or membrane-bound proteins. Such membrane-bound proteins and cell receptors include, but are not limited to, cytokine receptors, receptor kinases, receptor phosphatases, receptors involved in cell-cell interactions, channels, transporters, and cellular adhesin molecules like selectins and integrins. For instance, transduction of signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation is regulated in part by phosphorylation of various cellular proteins. Protein tyrosine kinases, enzymes that catalyze that process, can also act as growth factor receptors. Examples include fibroblast growth factor receptor and nerve growth factor receptor. </paragraph>

Myelin is formed by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS).

<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Human tetranectin is a 202 amino acid protein encoded by a gene spanning approximately 12 kbp of DNA (Berglund et al., <highlight><italic>FEBS Lett. </italic></highlight>309:15-19 (1992)). Tetranectin has been shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues and functions primarily as a plasminogen binding protein. Tetranectin has been classified in a distinct group of the C-type lectin superfamily but has structural and possibly functional similarity to the collectin proteins (Nielsen et al., <highlight><italic>FEBS Lett. </italic></highlight>412(2):388-396 (1997)). Recent studies have reported that variability in serum tetranectin levels may be predictive of the presence of various types of cancers including, for example, ovarian and colorectal cancers (Hogdall et al., <highlight><italic>Acta Oncol. </italic></highlight>35:63-69 (1996), Hogdall et al., <highlight><italic>Eur.

<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> The recognition of carbohydrates by lectins has been found to play an important role in various aspects of eukaryotic physiology. A number of different animal and plant lectin families exist, but it is the calcium dependent, or type C, lectins that have recently garnered the most attention. For example, the recognition of carbohydrate residues on either endothelial cells or leukocytes by the selectin family of calcium dependent lectins has been found to be of profound importance to the trafficking of leukocytes to inflammatory sites. Lasky, L., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Biochem., </italic></highlight>64 113-139 (1995). The biophysical analysis of these adhesive interactions has suggested that lectin-carbohydrate binding evolved in this case to allow for the adhesion between leukocytes and the endothelium under the high shear conditions of the vasculature. Thus, the rapid on rates of carbohydrate recognition by such lectins allows for a hasty acquisition of ligand, a necessity under the high shear of the vascular flow. The physiological use of type C lectins in this case is also supported by the relatively low affinities of these interactions, a requirement for the leukocyte rolling phenomenon that has been observed to occur at sites of acute inflammation. The crystal structures of the mannose binding protein (Weis et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>254, 1608-1615 &lsqb;1991&rsqb;; Weis et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>360 127-134 &lsqb;1992&rsqb;) and E-selectin (Graves et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>367(6463), 532-538 &lsqb;1994&rsqb;), together with various mutagenesis analyses (Erbe et al., <highlight><italic>J. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>119(1), 215-227 &lsqb;1992&rsqb;; Drickamer, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>360, 183-186 &lsqb;1992&rsqb;; Iobstet al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol.

Chem. </italic></highlight>270(23), 14047-14055 &lsqb;1995&rsqb;), is consistent with the supposition that the type C lectins are, in general, involved with the rapid recognition of clustered carbohydrates. Together, these data suggest that type C lectins perform a number of critical physiological phenomena through the rapid, relatively low affinity recognition of carbohydrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> Given the obvious importance of the lectin proteins in numerous biological processes, efforts are currently being made to identify novel lectin proteins or proteins having sequence homology to lectin proteins.

Myelin is a cellular sheath, formed by glial cells, that surrounds axons and axonal processes that enhances various electrochemical properties and provides trophic support to the neuron. Myelin is formed by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). Improper myelination of central and peripheral neurons occurs in a number of pathologies and leads to improper signal conduction within the nervous systems. Among the various demyelinating diseases Multiple Sclerosis is the most notable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-2904" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;2904&rsqb;</number> I. Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2905" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2905&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;PRO polypeptide&rdquo; and &ldquo;PRO&rdquo; as used herein and when immediately followed by a numerical designation refer to various polypeptides, wherein the complete designation (i.e., PRO/number) refers to specific polypeptide sequences as described herein. The terms &ldquo;PRO/number polypeptide&rdquo; and &ldquo;PRO/number&rdquo; wherein the term &ldquo;nunber&rdquo; is provided as an actual numerical designation as used herein encompass native sequence polypeptides and polypeptide variants (which are further defined herein). The PRO polypeptides described herein may be isolated from a variety of sources, such as from human tissue types or from another source, or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2906" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2906&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;native sequence PRO polypeptide&rdquo; comprises a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as the corresponding PRO polypeptide derived from nature. Such native sequence PRO polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term &ldquo;native sequence PRO polypeptide&rdquo; specifically encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms of the specific PRO polypeptide (e.g., an extracellular domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms (e.g., alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic variants of the polypeptide. In various embodiments of the invention, the native sequence PRO polypeptides disclosed herein are mature or full-length native sequence polypeptides comprising the full-length amino acids sequences shown in the accompanying figures. Start and stop codons are shown in bold font and underlined in the figures. However, while the PRO polypeptide disclosed in the accompanying figures are shown to begin with methionine residues designated herein as amino acid position 1 in the figures, it is conceivable and possible that other methionine residues located either upstream or downstream from the amino acid position 1 in the figures may be employed as the starting amino acid residue for the PRO polypeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2907" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2907&rsqb;</number> The PRO polypeptide &ldquo;extracellular domain&rdquo; or &ldquo;ECD&rdquo; refers to a form of the PRO polypeptide which is essentially free of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Ordinarily, a PRO polypeptide ECD will have less than 1% of such transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domains and preferably, will have less than 0.5% of such domains. It will be understood that any transmembrane domains identified for the PRO polypeptides of the present invention are identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of hydrophobic domain. The exact boundaries of a transmembrane domain may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids at either end of the domain as initially identified herein. Optionally, therefore, an extracellular domain of a PRO polypeptide may contain from about 5 or fewer amino acids on either side of the transmembrane domain/extracellular domain boundary as identified in the Examples or specification and such polypeptides, with or without the associated signal peptide, and nucleic acid encoding them, are contemplated by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2908" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2908&rsqb;</number> The approximate location of the &ldquo;signal peptides&rdquo; of the various PRO polypeptides disclosed herein are shown in the present specification and/or the accompanying figures. It is noted, however, that the C-terminal boundary of a signal peptide may vary, but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the signal peptide C-terminal boundary as initially identified herein, wherein the C-terminal boundary of the signal peptide may be identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of amino acid sequence element (e.g., Nielsen et al., <highlight><italic>Prot. Eng. </italic></highlight>10:1-6 (1997) and von Heinje et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids. Res. </italic></highlight>14:4683-4690 (1986)). Moreover, it is also recognized that, in some cases, cleavage of a signal sequence from a secreted polypeptide is not entirely uniform, resulting in more than one secreted species. These mature polypeptides, where the signal peptide is cleaved within no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the C-terminal boundary of the signal peptide as identified herein, and the polynucleotides encoding them, are contemplated by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2909" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2909&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;PRO polypeptide variant&rdquo; means an active PRO polypeptide as defined above or below having at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity with a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein, a PRO polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein, an extracellular domain of a PRO polypeptide, with or without the signal peptide, as disclosed herein or any other fragment of a full-length PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein. Such PRO polypeptide variants include, for instance, PRO polypeptides wherein one or more amino acid residues are added, or deleted, at the N- or C-terminus of the full-length native amino acid sequence. Ordinarily, a PRO polypeptide variant will have at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity, preferably at least about 81% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 82% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 83% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 84% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 85% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 86% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 87% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 88% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 89% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 90% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 91% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 92% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 93% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 94% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 95% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 96% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 97% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 98% amino acid sequence identity and most preferably at least about 99% amino acid sequence identity with a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein, a PRO polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein, an extracellular domain of a PRO polypeptide, with or without the signal peptide, as disclosed herein or any other specifically defined fragment of a full-length PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein. Ordinarily, PRO variant polypeptides are at least about 10 amino acids in length, often at least about 20 amino acids in length, more often at least about 30 amino acids in length, more often at least about 40 amino acids in length, more often at least about 50 amino acids in length, more often at least about 60 amino acids in length, more often at least about 70 amino acids in length, more often at least about 80 amino acids in length, more often at least about 90 amino acids in length, more often at least about 100 amino acids in length, more often at least about 150 amino acids in length, more often at least about 200 amino acids in length, more often at least about 300 amino acids in length, or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2910" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2910&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity&rdquo; with respect to the PRO polypeptide sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific PRO polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2, wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN-2 program is provided in Table 1 below. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. and the source code shown in Table 1 below has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. or may be compiled from the source code provided in Table 1 below. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2911" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2911&rsqb;</number> In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>100 times the fraction X/Y </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2912" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;2912&rsqb;</number> where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program&apos;s alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. As examples of % amino acid sequence identity calculations using this method, Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate how to calculate the % amino acid sequence identity of the amino acid sequence designated &ldquo;Comparison Protein&rdquo; to the amino acid sequence designated &ldquo;PRO&rdquo;, wherein &ldquo;PRO&rdquo; represents the amino acid sequence of a hypothetical PRO polypeptide of interest, &ldquo;Comparison Protein&rdquo; represents the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide against which the &ldquo;PRO&rdquo; polypeptide of interest is being compared, and &ldquo;X, &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and &ldquo;Z&rdquo; each represent different hypothetical amino acid residues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2913" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2913&rsqb;</number> Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program. However, % amino acid sequence identity values may also be obtained as described below by using the WU-BLAST-2 computer program (Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>266:460-480 (1996)). Most of the WU-BLAST-2 search parameters are set to the default values. Those not set to default values, i.e., the adjustable parameters, are set with the following values: overlap span&equals;1, overlap fraction&equals;0.125, word threshold (T)&equals;11, and scoring matrix&equals;BLOSUM62. When WU-BLAST-2 is employed, a % amino acid sequence identity value is determined by dividing (a) the number of matching identical amino acid residues between the amino acid sequence of the PRO polypeptide of interest having a sequence derived from the native PRO polypeptide and the comparison amino acid sequence of interest (i.e., the sequence against which the PRO polypeptide of interest is being compared which may be a PRO variant polypeptide) as determined by WU-BLAST-2 by (b) the total number of amino acid residues of the PRO polypeptide of interest. For example, in the statement &ldquo;a polypeptide comprising an the amino acid sequence A which has or having at least 80% amino acid sequence identity to the amino acid sequence B&rdquo;, the amino acid sequence A is the comparison amino acid sequence of interest and the amino acid sequence B is the amino acid sequence of the PRO polypeptide of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2914" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2914&rsqb;</number> Percent amino acid sequence identity may also be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2 (Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>25:3389-3402 (1997)). The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI-BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default values including, for example, unmask&equals;yes, strand&equals;all, expected occurrences&equals;10, minimum low complexity length&equals;15/5, multi-pass e-value&equals;0.01, constant for multi-pass&equals;25, dropoff for final gapped alignment&equals;25 and scoring matrix BLOSUM62. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2915" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2915&rsqb;</number> In situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-2916" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;2916&rsqb;</number> where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 in that program&apos;s alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2917" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2917&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;PRO variant polynucleotide&rdquo; or &ldquo;PRO variant nucleic acid sequence&rdquo; means a nucleic acid molecule which encodes an active PRO polypeptide as defined below and which has at least about 80% nucleic acid sequence identity with a nucleotide acid sequence encoding a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein, a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein, an extracellular domain of a PRO polypeptide, with or without the signal peptide, as disclosed herein or any other fragment of a full-length PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein. Ordinarily, a PRO variant polynucleotide will have at least about 80% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 81% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 82% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 83% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 84% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 85% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 86% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 87% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 88% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 89% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 90% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 91% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 92% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 93% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 94% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 95% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 96% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 97% nucleic acid sequence identity, more preferably at least about 98% nucleic acid sequence identity and yet more preferably at least about 99% nucleic acid sequence identity wit h a nucleic acid sequence encoding a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein, a full-length native sequence PRO polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein, an extracellular domain of a PRO polypeptide, with or without the signal sequence, as disclosed herein or any other fragment of a full-length PRO polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein. Variants do not encompass the native nucleotide sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2918" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2918&rsqb;</number> Ordinarily, PRO variant polynucleotides are at least about 30 nucleotides in length, often at least about 60 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 90 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 120 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 150 nucleotides in length , more often at least about 180 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 210 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 240 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 270 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 300 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 450 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 600 nucleotides in length, more often at least about 900 nucleotides in length, or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2919" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2919&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Percent (%) nucleic acid sequence identity&rdquo; with respect to PRO-encoding nucleic acid sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotides in the PRO nucleic acid sequence of interest, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent nucleic acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. For purposes herein, however, % nucleic acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2, wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN-2 program is provided in Table 1 below. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. and the source code shown in Table 1 below has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. or may be compiled from the source code provided in Table 1 below. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2920" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2920&rsqb;</number> In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for nucleic acid sequence comparisons, the % nucleic acid sequence identity of a given nucleic acid sequence C to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D (which can alternatively be phrased as a given nucleic acid sequence C that has or comprises a certain % nucleic acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D) is calculated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>100 times the fraction W/Z </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2921" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;2921&rsqb;</number> where W is the number of nucleotides scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program&apos;s alignment of C and D, and where Z is the total number of nucleotides in D. It will be appreciated that where the length of nucleic acid sequence C is not equal to the length of nucleic acid sequence D, the % nucleic acid sequence identity of C to D will not equal the % nucleic acid sequence identity of D to C. As examples of % nucleic acid sequence identity calculations, Tables 4 and 5, demonstrate how to calculate the % nucleic acid sequence identity of the nucleic acid sequence designated &ldquo;Comparison DNA&rdquo; to the nucleic acid sequence designated &ldquo;PRO-DNA&rdquo;, wherein &ldquo;PRO-DNA&rdquo; represents a hypothetical PRO-encoding nucleic acid sequence of interest, &ldquo;Comparison DNA&rdquo; represents the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid molecule against which the &ldquo;PRO-DNA&rdquo; nucleic acid molecule of interest is being compared, and &ldquo;N&rdquo;, &ldquo;L&rdquo; and &ldquo;V&rdquo; each represent different hypothetical nucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2922" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2922&rsqb;</number> Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % nucleic acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program. However, % nucleic acid sequence identity values may also be obtained as described below by using the WU-BLAST-2 computer program (Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>266:460-480 (1996)). Most of the WU-BLAST-2 search parameters are set to the default values. Those not set to default values, i.e., the adjustable parameters, are set with the following values: overlap span&equals;1, overlap fraction&equals;0.125, word threshold (T)&equals;11, and scoring matrix&equals;BLOSUM62. When WU-BLAST-2 is employed, a % nucleic acid sequence identity value is determined by dividing (a) the number of matching identical nucleotides between the nucleic acid sequence of the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule of interest having a sequence derived from the native sequence PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid and the comparison nucleic acid molecule of interest (i.e., the sequence against which the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule of interest is being compared which may be a variant PRO polynucleotide) as determined by WU-BLAST-2 by (b) the total number of nucleotides of the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule of interest. For example, in the statement &ldquo;an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence A which has or having at least 80% nucleic acid sequence identity to the nucleic acid sequence B&rdquo;, the nucleic acid sequence A is the comparison nucleic acid molecule of interest and the nucleic acid sequence B is the nucleic acid sequence of the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2923" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2923&rsqb;</number> Percent nucleic acid sequence identity may also be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2 (Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>25:3389-3402 (1997)). The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI-BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default values including, for example, unmask&equals;yes, strand&equals;all, expected occurrences&equals;10, minimum low complexity length&equals;15/5, multi-pass e-value&equals;0.01, constant for multi-pass&equals;25, dropoff for final gapped alignment&equals;25 and scoring matrix BLOSUM62. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2924" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2924&rsqb;</number> In situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for sequence comparisons, the % nucleic acid sequence identity of a given nucleic acid sequence C to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D (which can alternatively be phrased as a given nucleic acid sequence C that has or comprises a certain % nucleic acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D) is calculated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>100 times the fraction W/Z </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2925" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;2925&rsqb;</number> where W is the number of nucleotides scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 in that program&apos;s alignment of C and D, and where Z is the total number of nucleotides in D. It will be appreciated that where the length of nucleic acid sequence C is not equal to the length of nucleic acid sequence D, the % nucleic acid sequence identity of C to D will not equal the % nucleic acid sequence identity of D to C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2926" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2926&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, PRO variant polynucleotides are nucleic acid molecules that encode an active PRO polypeptide and which are capable of hybridizing, preferably under stringent hybridization and wash conditions, to nucleotide sequences encoding a full-length PRO polypeptide as disclosed herein. PRO variant polypeptides may be those that are encoded by a PRO variant polynucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2927" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2927&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;positives&rdquo;, in the context of sequence comparison performed as described above, includes residues in the sequences compared that are not identical but have similar properties (e.g. as a result of conservative substitutions, see Table 6 below). For purposes herein, the % value of positives is determined by dividing (a) the number of amino acid residues scoring a positive value between the PRO polypeptide amino acid sequence of interest having a sequence derived from the native PRO polypeptide sequence and the comparison amino acid sequence of interest (i.e., the amino acid sequence against which the PRO polypeptide sequence is being compared) as determined in the BLOSUM62 matrix of WU-BLAST-2 by (b) the total number of amino acid residues of the PRO polypeptide of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2928" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2928&rsqb;</number> Unless specifically stated otherwise, the % value of positives is calculated as described in the immediately preceding paragraph. However, in the context of the amino acid sequence identity comparisons performed as described for ALIGN-2 and NCBI-BLAST-2 above, includes amino acid residues in the sequences compared that are not only identical, but also those that have similar properties. Amino acid residues that score a positive value to an amino acid residue of interest are those that are either identical to the amino acid residue of interest or are a preferred substitution (as defined in Table 6 below) of the amino acid residue of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2929" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2929&rsqb;</number> For amino acid sequence comparisons using ALIGN-2 or NCBI-BLAST2, the % value of positives of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % positives to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>100 times the fraction X/Y </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2930" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;2930&rsqb;</number> where X is the number of amino acid residues scoring a positive value as defined above by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 or NCBI-BLAST2 in that program&apos;s alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % positives of A to B will not equal the % positives of B to A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2931" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2931&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Isolated,&rdquo; when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein, means polypeptide that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (2) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells, since at least one component of the PRO polypeptide natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2932" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2932&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid or other polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid. An isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule includes polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2933" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2933&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;control sequences&rdquo; refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2934" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2934&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid is &ldquo;operably linked&rdquo; when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, &ldquo;operably linked&rdquo; means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2935" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2935&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, for example, single anti-PRO monoclonal antibodies (including agonist, antagonist, and neutralizing antibodies), anti-PRO antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, single chain anti-PRO antibodies, and fragments of anti-PRO antibodies (see below). The term &ldquo;monoclonal antibody&rdquo; as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2936" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2936&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Stringency&rdquo; of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence, the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, see Ausubel et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, Wiley Interscience Publishers, (1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2937" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2937&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Stringent conditions&rdquo; or &ldquo;high stringency conditions&rdquo;, as defined herein, may be identified by those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50&deg; C.; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42&deg; C.; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5&times; SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5&times; Denhardt&apos;s solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 &mgr;g/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42&deg; C., with washes at 42&deg; C. in 0.2&times; SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55&deg; C., followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1&times; SSC containing EDTA at 55&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2938" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2938&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Moderately stringent conditions&rdquo; may be identified as described by Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual</italic></highlight>, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989, and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and % SDS) less stringent that those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37&deg; C. in a solution comprising: 20% formamide, 5&times; SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5&times; Denhardt&apos;s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 mg/ml denatured sheared sahnon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 1&times; SSC at about 37-50&deg; C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2939" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2939&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;epitope tagged&rdquo; when used herein refers to a chimeric polypeptide comprising a PRO polypeptide fused to a &ldquo;tag polypeptide&rdquo;. The tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody can be made, yet is short enough such that it does not interfere with activity of the polypeptide to which it is fused. The tag polypeptide preferably also is fairly unique so that the antibody does not substantially cross-react with other epitopes. Suitable tag polypeptides generally have at least six amino acid residues and usually between about 8 and 50 amino acid residues (preferably, between about 10 and 20 amino acid residues). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2940" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2940&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;immunoadhesin&rdquo; designates antibody-like molecules which combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an &ldquo;adhesin&rdquo;) with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is &ldquo;heterologous&rdquo;), and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-1 and IgA-2), IgE, IgD or IgM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2941" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2941&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Active&rdquo; or &ldquo;activity&rdquo; for the purposes herein refers to form(s) of a PRO polypeptide which retain a biological and/or an immunological activity of native or naturally-occurring PRO, wherein &ldquo;biological&rdquo; activity refers to a biological function (either inhibitory or stimulatory) caused by a native or naturally-occurring PRO other than the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally-occurring PRO and an &ldquo;immunological&rdquo; activity refers to the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally-occurring PRO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2942" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2942&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antagonist&rdquo; is used in the broadest sense, and includes any molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, or neutralizes a biological activity of a native PRO polypeptide disclosed herein. In a similar manner, the term &ldquo;agonist&rdquo; is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that mimics a biological activity of a native PRO polypeptide disclosed herein. Suitable agonist or antagonist molecules specifically include agonist or antagonist antibodies or antibody fragments, fragments or amino acid sequence variants of native PRO polypeptides, peptides, antisense oligonucleotides, small organic molecules, etc. Methods for identifying agonists or antagonists of a PRO polypeptide may comprise contacting a PRO polypeptide with a candidate agonist or antagonist molecule and measuring a detectable change in one or more biological activities normally associated with the PRO polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2943" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2943&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Treatment&rdquo; refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2944" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2944&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Chronic&rdquo; administration refers to administration of the agent(s) in a continuous mode as opposed to an acute mode, so as to maintain the initial therapeutic effect (activity) for an extended period of time. &ldquo;Intermittent&rdquo; administration is treatment that is not consecutively done without interruption, but rather is cyclic in nature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2945" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2945&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Mammal&rdquo; for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, cats, cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, goats, rabbits, etc. Preferably, the mammal is human. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2946" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2946&rsqb;</number> Administration &ldquo;in combination with&rdquo; one or more further therapeutic agents includes simultaneous (concurrent) and consecutive administration in any order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2947" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2947&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Carriers&rdquo; as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers which are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN&trade;, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICS&trade;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2948" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2948&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Antibody fragments&rdquo; comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab&prime;, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (Zapata et al., <highlight><italic>Protein Eng. </italic></highlight>8(10): 1057-1062 &lsqb;1995&rsqb;); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2949" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2949&rsqb;</number> Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called &ldquo;Fab&rdquo; fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual &ldquo;Fc&rdquo; fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2950" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2950&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Fv&rdquo; is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2951" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2951&rsqb;</number> The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab&prime; fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab&prime;-SH is the designation herein for Fab&prime; in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab&prime; fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2952" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2952&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;light chains&rdquo; of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2953" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2953&rsqb;</number> Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2954" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2954&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Single-chain Fv&rdquo; or &ldquo;sFv&rdquo; antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun in <highlight><italic>The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies</italic></highlight>, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2955" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2955&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;diabodies&rdquo; refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>) in the same polypeptide chain (V<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>-V<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>90:6444-6448 (1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2956" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2956&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody&apos;s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2957" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2957&rsqb;</number> The word &ldquo;label&rdquo; when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody so as to generate a &ldquo;labeled&rdquo; antibody. The label may be detectable by itself (e.g. radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2958" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2958&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;solid phase&rdquo; is meant a non-aqueous matrix to which the antibody of the present invention can adhere. Examples of solid phases encompassed herein include those formed partially or entirely of glass (e.g., controlled pore glass), polysaccharides (e.g., agarose), polyacrylamides, polystyrene, polyvinyl alcohol and silicones. In certain embodiments, depending on the context, the solid phase can comprise the well of an assay plate; in others it is a purification column (e.g., an affinity chromatography column). This term also includes a discontinuous solid phase of discrete particles, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-2959" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;2959&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;liposome&rdquo; is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug (such as a PRO polypeptide or antibody thereto) to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-3326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3326&rsqb;</number> Variations in the native full-length sequence PRO or in various domains of the PRO described herein, can be made, for example, using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non-conservative mutations set forth, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,934. Variations may be a substitution, deletion or insertion of one or more codons encoding the PRO that results in a change in the amino acid sequence of the PRO as compared with the native sequence PRO. Optionally the variation is by substitution of at least one amino acid with any other amino acid in one or more of the domains of the PRO. Guidance in determining which amino acid residue may be inserted, substituted or deleted without adversely affecting the desired activity may be found by comparing the sequence of the PRO with that of homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology. Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine, i.e., conservative amino acid replacements. Insertions or deletions may optionally be in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The variation allowed may be determined by systematically making insertions, deletions or substitutions of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the full-length or mature native sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3327&rsqb;</number> PRO polypeptide fragments are provided herein. Such fragments may be truncated at the N-terminus or C-terminus, or may lack internal residues, for example, when compared with a full length native protein. Certain fragments lack amino acid residues that are not essential for a desired biological activity of the PRO polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3328&rsqb;</number> PRO fragments may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. Desired peptide fragments may be chemically synthesized. An alternative approach involves generating PRO fragments by enzymatic digestion, e.g., by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at sites defined by particular amino acid residues, or by digesting the DNA with suitable restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another suitable technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding a desired polypeptide fragment, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed at the 5&prime; and 3&prime; primers in the PCR. Preferably, PRO polypeptide fragments share at least one biological and/or immunological activity with the native PRO polypeptide disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3329&rsqb;</number> In particular embodiments, conservative substitutions of interest are shown in Table 6 under the heading of preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 6, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, are introduced and the products screened.

<paragraph id="P-3330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3330&rsqb;</number> Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity of the PRO polypeptide are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3331" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;3331&rsqb;</number> (1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3332" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;3332&rsqb;</number> (2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3333" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;3333&rsqb;</number> (3) acidic: asp, glu; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3334" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;3334&rsqb;</number> (4) basic: asn, gin, his, lys, arg; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3335" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;3335&rsqb;</number> (5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3336" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;3336&rsqb;</number> (6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3337&rsqb;</number> Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, more preferably, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3338&rsqb;</number> The variations can be made using methods known in the art such as oligonucleotide-mediated (site-directed) mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and PCR mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis &lsqb;Carter et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res., </italic></highlight>13:4331 (1986); Zoller et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res., </italic></highlight>10:6487 (1987)&rsqb;, cassette mutagenesis &lsqb;Wells et al., <highlight><italic>Gene, </italic></highlight>34:315 (1985)&rsqb;, restriction selection mutagenesis &lsqb;Wells et al., <highlight><italic>Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London SerA, </italic></highlight>317:415 (1986)&rsqb; or other known techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the PRO variant DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3339&rsqb;</number> Scanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small, neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine, glycine, serine, and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant &lsqb;Cunningham and Wells, <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>244: 1081-1085 (1989)&rsqb;. Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further, it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions &lsqb;Creighton, <highlight><italic>The Proteins</italic></highlight>, (W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., N.Y.); Chothia, <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>150:1 (1976)&rsqb;. If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant, an isoteric amino acid can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3340&rsqb;</number> C. Modifications of PRO </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3341&rsqb;</number> Covalent modifications of PRO are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of a PRO polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of the PRO. Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful, for instance, for crosslinking PRO to a water-insoluble support matrix or surface for use in the method for purifying anti-PRO antibodies, and vice-versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., 1,1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for example, esters with 4-azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3&prime;-dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-1,8-octane and agents such as methyl-3-&lsqb;(p-azidophenyl)dithio&rsqb;propioimidate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3342&rsqb;</number> Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively, hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the &agr;-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains &lsqb;T. E. Creighton, <highlight><italic>Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties</italic></highlight>, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)&rsqb;, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3343&rsqb;</number> Another type of covalent modification of the PRO polypeptide included within the scope of this invention comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of the polypeptide. &ldquo;Altering the native glycosylation pattern&rdquo; is intended for purposes herein to mean deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence PRO (either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation by chemical and/or enzymatic means), and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the native sequence PRO. In addition, the phrase includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins, involving a change in the nature and proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3344&rsqb;</number> Addition of glycosylation sites to the PRO polypeptide may be accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence. The alteration may be made, for example, by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the native sequence PRO (for O-linked glycosylation sites). The PRO amino acid sequence may optionally be altered through changes at the DNA level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the PRO polypeptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3345&rsqb;</number> Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the PRO polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the polypeptide. Such methods are described in the art, e.g., in WO 87/05330 published Sep. 11, 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, <highlight><italic>CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem</italic></highlight>., pp. 259-306 (1981). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3346&rsqb;</number> Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the PRO polypeptide may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically or by mutational substitution of codons encoding for amino acid residues that serve as targets for glycosylation. Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known in the art and described, for instance, by Hakimuddin, et al., <highlight><italic>Arch. Biochem. Biophys., </italic></highlight>259:52 (1987) and by Edge et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem., </italic></highlight>118:131 (1981). Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al., <highlight><italic>Meth. Enzymol., </italic></highlight>138:350 (1987). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3347&rsqb;</number> Another type of covalent modification of PRO comprises linking the PRO polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3348&rsqb;</number> The PRO of the present invention may also be modified in a way to form a chimeric molecule comprising PRO fused to another, heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3349&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the PRO with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti-tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino- or carboxyl-terminus of the PRO. The presence of such epitope-tagged forms of the PRO can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also, provision of the epitope tag enables the PRO to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti-tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly-histidine (poly-his) or poly-histidine-glycine (poly-his-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 &lsqb;Field et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell. Biol., </italic></highlight>8:2159-2165 (1988)&rsqb;; the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto &lsqb;Evan et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular and Cellular Biology, </italic></highlight>5:3610-3616 (1985)&rsqb;; and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody &lsqb;Paborsky et al., <highlight><italic>Protein Engineering, </italic></highlight>3(6):547-553 (1990)&rsqb;. Other tag polypeptides include the Flag-peptide &lsqb;Hopp et al., <highlight><italic>BioTechnology, </italic></highlight>6:1204-1210 (1988)&rsqb;; the KT3 epitope peptide &lsqb;Martin et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>255:192-194 (1992)&rsqb;; an &agr;-tubulin epitope peptide &lsqb;Skinner et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>266:15163-15166 (1991)&rsqb;; and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag &lsqb;Lutz-Freyermuth et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>87:6393-6397 (1990)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3350&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the chimeric molecule may comprise a fusion of the PRO with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule (also referred to as an &ldquo;immunoadhesin&rdquo;), such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a soluble (transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated) form of a PRO polypeptide in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2 and CH3, or the hinge, CH1, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgG1 molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,428,130 issued Jun. 27, 1995. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3351&rsqb;</number> D. Preparation of PRO </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3352&rsqb;</number> The description below relates primarily to production of PRO by culturing cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing PRO nucleic acid. It is, of course, contemplated that alternative methods, which are well known in the art, may be employed to prepare PRO. For instance, the PRO sequence, or portions thereof, may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques &lsqb;see, e.g., Stewart et al., <highlight><italic>Solid</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Phase Peptide Synthesis</italic></highlight>, W.H. Freeman Co., San Francisco, Calif. (1969); Merrifield, <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>85:2149-2154 (1963)&rsqb;. In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be accomplished, for instance, using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer (Foster City, Calif.) using manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Various portions of the PRO may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or enzymatic methods to produce the full-length PRO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3353&rsqb;</number> 1. Isolation of DNA Encoding PRO </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3354&rsqb;</number> DNA encoding PRO may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the PRO mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly, human PRO DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue, such as described in the Examples. The PRO-encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by known synthetic procedures (e.g., automated nucleic acid synthesis). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3355&rsqb;</number> Libraries can be screened with probes (such as antibodies to the PRO or oligonucleotides of at least about 20-80 bases) designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures, such as described in Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). An alternative means to isolate the gene encoding PRO is to use PCR methodology &lsqb;Sambrook et al., supra; Dieffenbach et al., <highlight><italic>PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3356&rsqb;</number> The Examples below describe techniques for screening a cDNA library. The oligonucleotide sequences selected as probes should be of sufficient length and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art, and include the use of radiolabels like <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled ATP, biotinylation or enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions, including moderate stringency and high stringency, are provided in Sambrook et al., supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3357&rsqb;</number> Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity (at either the amino acid or nucleotide level) within defined regions of the molecule or across the full-length sequence can be determined using methods known in the art and as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3358&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries using the deduced amino acid sequence disclosed herein for the first time, and, if necessary, using conventional primer extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al., supra, to detect precursors and processing intermediates of mRNA that may not have been reverse-transcribed into cDNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3359&rsqb;</number> 2. Selection and Transformation of Host Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3360&rsqb;</number> Host cells are transfected or transformed with expression or cloning vectors described herein for PRO production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. The culture conditions, such as media, temperature, pH and the like, can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In general, principles, protocols, and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of cell cultures can be found in <highlight><italic>Mammalian Cell Biotechnology: a Practical Approach</italic></highlight>, M. Butler, ed. (IRL Press, 1991) and Sambrook et al., supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3361&rsqb;</number> Methods of eukaryotic cell transfection and prokaryotic cell transformation are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, CaPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, liposome-mediated and electroporation. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is performed using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in Sambrook et al., supra, or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes. Infection with <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by Shaw et al., <highlight><italic>Gene, </italic></highlight>23:315 (1983) and WO 89/05859 published Jun. 29, 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb, <highlight><italic>Virology, </italic></highlight>52:456-457 (1978) can be employed. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transfections have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al., <highlight><italic>J. Bact., </italic></highlight>130:946 (1977) and Hsiao et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci</italic></highlight>. (<highlight><italic>USA</italic></highlight>), 76:3829 (1979). However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells, such as by nuclear microinjection, electroporation, bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells, or polycations, e.g., polybrene, polyornithine, may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells, see Keown et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology, </italic></highlight>185:527-537 (1990) and Mansour et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>336:348-352 (1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3362&rsqb;</number> Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells. Suitable prokaryotes include but are not limited to eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>. Various <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strains are publicly available, such as <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>K12 strain MM294 (ATCC 31,446); <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>X1776 (ATCC 31,537); <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain W3110 (ATCC 27,325) and K5772 (ATCC 53,635). Other suitable prokaryotic host cells include Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia, e.g., <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, e.g., <highlight><italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic></highlight>, Serratia, e.g., <highlight><italic>Serratia marcescans</italic></highlight>, and Shigella, as well as Bacilli such as <highlight><italic>B. subtilis </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>B. licheniformis </italic></highlight>(e.g., <highlight><italic>B. licheniformis </italic></highlight>41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published Apr. 12, 1989), Pseudomonas such as <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></highlight>, and Streptomyces. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Strain W3110 is one particularly preferred host or parent host because it is a common host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations.

<paragraph id="P-3364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3364&rsqb;</number> Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated PRO are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9, as well as plant cells. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS cells. More specific examples include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., <highlight><italic>J.

The selection of the appropriate host cell is deemed to be within the skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3365&rsqb;</number> 3. Selection and Use of a Replicable Vector </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3366&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) encoding PRO may be inserted into a replicable vector for cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may, for example, be in the form of a plasmid, cosmid, viral particle, or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site(s) using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3367&rsqb;</number> The PRO may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which may be a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the PRO-encoding DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence may be a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, 1pp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, alpha factor leader (including Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces &agr;-factor leaders, the latter described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,182), or acid phosphatase leader, the <highlight><italic>C. albicans </italic></highlight>glucoamylase leader (EP 362,179 published Apr. 4, 1990), or the signal described in WO 90/13646 published Nov. 15, 1990. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences may be used to direct secretion of the protein, such as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species, as well as viral secretory leaders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3368&rsqb;</number> Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2&mgr; plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3369&rsqb;</number> Expression and cloning vectors will typically contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3370&rsqb;</number> An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the PRO-encoding nucleic acid, such as DHFR or thymidine kinase. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>77:4216 (1980). A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 &lsqb;Stinchcomb et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>282:39 (1979); Kingsman et al., <highlight><italic>Gene, </italic></highlight>7:141 (1979); Tschemper et al., <highlight><italic>Gene, </italic></highlight>10:157 (1980)&rsqb;. The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1 &lsqb;Jones, <highlight><italic>Genetics, </italic></highlight>85:12 (1977)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3371&rsqb;</number> Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the PRO-encoding nucleic acid sequence to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the &bgr;-lactamase and lactose promoter systems &lsqb;Chang et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>275:615 (1978); Goeddel et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>281:544 (1979)&rsqb;, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system &lsqb;Goeddel, <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res., </italic></highlight>8:4057 (1980); EP 36,776&rsqb;, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter &lsqb;deBoer et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>80:21-25 (1983)&rsqb;. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding PRO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3372&rsqb;</number> Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase &lsqb;Hitzeman et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>255:2073 (1980)&rsqb; or other glycolytic enzymes &lsqb;Hess et al., <highlight><italic>J. Adv. Enzyme Reg., </italic></highlight>7:149 (1968); Holland, <highlight><italic>Biochemistry, </italic></highlight>17:4900 (1978)&rsqb;, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3373&rsqb;</number> Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3374&rsqb;</number> PRO transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus (UK 2,211,504 published Jul. 5, 1989), adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, and from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3375&rsqb;</number> Transcription of a DNA encoding the PRO by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, &agr;-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5&prime; or 3&prime; to the PRO coding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5&prime; from the promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3376&rsqb;</number> Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5&prime; and, occasionally 3&prime;, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding PRO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3377&rsqb;</number> Still other methods, vectors, and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of PRO in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>293:620-625 (1981); Mantei et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>281:4046 (1979); EP 117,060; and EP 117,058. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3378&rsqb;</number> 4. Detecting Gene Amplification/Expression </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3379&rsqb;</number> Gene amplification and/or expression may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional Southern blotting, Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA &lsqb;Thomas, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>77:5201-5205 (1980)&rsqb;, dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe, based on the sequences provided herein. Alternatively, antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes, including DNA duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA-protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface, so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface, the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3380&rsqb;</number> Gene expression, alternatively, may be measured by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids, to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and/or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal or polyclonal, and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently, the antibodies may be prepared against a native sequence PRO polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequences provided herein or against exogenous sequence fused to PRO DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3381&rsqb;</number> 5. Purification of Polypeptide </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3382&rsqb;</number> Forms of PRO may be recovered from culture medium or from host cell lysates. If membrane-bound, it can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution (e.g. Triton-X 100) or by enzymatic cleavage. Cells employed in expression of PRO can be disrupted by various physical or chemical means, such as freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or cell lysing agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3383&rsqb;</number> It may be desired to purify PRO from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: by fractionation on an ion-exchange column; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; protein A Sepharose columns to remove contaminants such as IgG; and metal chelating columns to bind epitope-tagged forms of the PRO. Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are known in the art and described for example in Deutscher, <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology, </italic></highlight>182 (1990); Scopes, <highlight><italic>Protein Purification: Principles and Practice</italic></highlight>, Springer-Verlag, New York (1982). The purification step(s) selected will depend, for example, on the nature of the production process used and the particular PRO produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3384&rsqb;</number> E. Uses for PRO </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3385&rsqb;</number> Nucleotide sequences (or their complement) encoding PRO have various applications in the art of molecular biology, including uses as hybridization probes, in chromosome and gene mapping and in the generation of anti-sense RNA and DNA. PRO nucleic acid will also be useful for the preparation of PRO polypeptides by the recombinant techniques described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3386&rsqb;</number> The full-length native sequence PRO gene, or portions thereof, may be used as hybridization probes for a cDNA library to isolate the full-length PRO cDNA or to isolate still other cDNAs (for instance, those encoding naturally-occurring variants of PRO or PRO from other species) which have a desired sequence identity to the native PRO sequence disclosed herein. Optionally, the length of the probes will be about 20 to about 50 bases. The hybridization probes may be derived from at least partially novel regions of the full length native nucleotide sequence wherein those regions may be determined without undue experimentation or from genomic sequences including promoters, enhancer elements and introns of native sequence PRO. By way of example, a screening method will comprise isolating the coding region of the PRO gene using the known DNA sequence to synthesize a selected probe of about 40 bases. Hybridization probes may be labeled by a variety of labels, including radionucleotides such as <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P or <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S, or enzymatic labels such as alkaline phosphatase coupled to the probe via avidintbiotin coupling systems. Labeled probes having a sequence complementary to that of the PRO gene of the present invention can be used to screen libraries of human cDNA, genomic DNA or mRNA to determine which members of such libraries the probe hybridizes to. Hybridization techniques are described in further detail in the Examples below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3387&rsqb;</number> Any EST sequences disclosed in the present application may similarly be employed as probes, using the methods disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3388&rsqb;</number> Other useful fragments of the PRO nucleic acids include antisense or sense oligonucleotides comprising a singe-stranded nucleic acid sequence (either RNA or DNA) capable of binding to target PRO mRNA (sense) or PRO DNA (antisense) sequences. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides, according to the present invention, comprise a fragment of the coding region of PRO DNA. Such a fragment generally comprises at least about 14 nucleotides, preferably from about 14 to 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide, based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in, for example, Stein and Cohen (<highlight><italic>Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>48:2659, 1988) and van der Krol et al. (<highlight><italic>BioTechniques </italic></highlight>6:958, 1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3389&rsqb;</number> Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block transcription or translation of the target sequence by one of several means, including enhanced degradation of the duplexes, premature termination of transcription or translation, or by other means. The antisense oligonucleotides thus may be used to block expression of PRO proteins. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides further comprise oligonucleotides having modified sugar-phosphodiester backbones (or other sugar linkages, such as those described in WO 91/06629) and wherein such sugar linkages are resistant to endogenous nucleases. Such oligonucleotides with resistant sugar linkages are stable in vivo (i.e., capable of resisting enzymatic degradation) but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3390&rsqb;</number> Other examples of sense or antisense oligonucleotides include those oligonucleotides which are covalently linked to organic moieties, such as those described in WO 90/10048, and other moieties that increases affinity of the oligonucleotide for a target nucleic acid sequence, such as poly-(L-lysine). Further still, intercalating agents, such as ellipticine, and alkylating agents or metal complexes may be attached to sense or antisense oligonucleotides to modify binding specificities of the antisense or sense oligonucleotide for the target nucleotide sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3391&rsqb;</number> Antisense or sense oligonucleotides may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by any gene transfer method, including, for example, CaPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-mediated DNA transfection, electroporation, or by using gene transfer vectors such as Epstein-Barr virus. In a preferred procedure, an antisense or sense oligonucleotide is inserted into a suitable retroviral vector. A cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence is contacted with the recombinant retroviral vector, either in vivo or ex vivo. Suitable retroviral vectors include, but are not limited to, those derived from the murine retrovirus M-MULV, N2 (a retrovirus derived from M-MuLV), or the double copy vectors designated DCT5A, DCT5B and DCT5C (see WO 90/13641). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3392&rsqb;</number> Sense or antisense oligonucleotides also may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleotide sequence by formation of a conjugate with a ligand binding molecule, as described in WO 91/04753. Suitable ligand binding molecules include, but are not limited to, cell surface receptors, growth factors, other cytokines, or other ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Preferably, conjugation of the ligand binding molecule does not substantially interfere with the ability of the ligand binding molecule to bind to its corresponding molecule or receptor, or block entry of the sense or antisense oligonucleotide or its conjugated version into the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3393&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a sense or an antisense oligonucleotide may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by formation of an oligonucleotide-lipid complex, as described in WO 90/10448. The sense or antisense oligonucleotide-lipid complex is preferably dissociated within the cell by an endogenous lipase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3394&rsqb;</number> Antisense or sense RNA or DNA molecules are generally at least about 5 bases in length, about 10 bases in length, about 15 bases in length, about 20 bases in length, about 25 bases in length, about 30 bases in length, about 35 bases in length, about 40 bases in length, about 45 bases in length, about 50 bases in length, about 55 bases in length, about 60 bases in length, about 65 bases in length, about 70 bases in length, about 75 bases in length, about 80 bases in length, about 85 bases in length, about 90 bases in length, about 95 bases in length, about 100 bases in length, or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3395&rsqb;</number> The probes may also be employed in PCR techniques to generate a pool of sequences for identification of closely related PRO coding sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3396&rsqb;</number> Nucleotide sequences encoding a PRO can also be used to construct hybridization probes for mapping the gene which encodes that PRO and for the genetic analysis of individuals with genetic disorders. The nucleotide sequences provided herein may be mapped to a chromosome and specific regions of a chromosome using known techniques, such as in situ hybridization, linkage analysis against known chromosomal markers, and hybridization screening with libraries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3397&rsqb;</number> When the coding sequences for PRO encode a protein which binds to another protein (example, where the PRO is a receptor), the PRO can be used in assays to identify the other proteins or molecules involved in the binding interaction. By such methods, inhibitors of the receptor/ligand binding interaction can be identified. Proteins involved in such binding interactions can also be used to screen for peptide or small molecule inhibitors or agonists of the binding interaction. Also, the receptor PRO can be used to isolate correlative ligand(s). Screening assays can be designed to find lead compounds that mimic the biological activity of a native PRO or a receptor for PRO. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high-throughput screening of chemical libraries, making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates. Small molecules contemplated include synthetic organic or inorganic compounds. The assays can be performed in a variety of formats, including protein-protein binding assays, biochemical screening assays, immunoassays and cell based assays, which are well characterized in the art. Nucleic acids which encode PRO or its modified forms can also be used to generate either transgenic animals or &ldquo;knock out&rdquo; animals which, in turn, are useful in the development and screening of therapeutically useful reagents. A transgenic animal (e.g., a mouse or rat) is an animal having cells that contain a transgene, which transgene was introduced into the animal or an ancestor of the animal at a prenatal, e.g., an embryonic stage. A transgene is a DNA which is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops. In one embodiment, cDNA encoding PRO can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding PRO in accordance with established techniques and the genomic sequences used to generate transgenic animals that contain cells which express DNA encoding PRO. Methods for generating transgenic animals, particularly animals such as mice or rats, have become conventional in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,736,866 and 4,870,009. Typically, particular cells would be targeted for PRO transgene incorporation with tissue-specific enhancers. Transgenic animals that include a copy of a transgene encoding PRO introduced into the germ line of the animal at an embryonic stage can be used to examine the effect of increased expression of DNA encoding PRO. Such animals can be used as tester animals for reagents thought to confer protection from, for example, pathological conditions associated with its overexpression. In accordance with this facet of the invention, an animal is treated with the reagent and a reduced incidence of the pathological condition, compared to untreated animals bearing the transgene, would indicate a potential therapeutic intervention for the pathological condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3398&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, non-human homologues of PRO can be used to construct a PRO &ldquo;knock out&rdquo; animal which has a defective or altered gene encoding PRO as a result of homologous recombination between the endogenous gene encoding PRO and altered genomic DNA encoding PRO introduced into an embryonic stem cell of the animal. For example, cDNA encoding PRO can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding PRO in accordance with established techniques. A portion of the genomic DNA encoding PRO can be deleted or replaced with another gene, such as a gene encoding a selectable marker which can be used to monitor integration. Typically, several kilobases of unaltered flanking DNA (both at the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends) are included in the vector &lsqb;see e.g., Thomas and Capecchi, <highlight><italic>Cell, </italic></highlight>51:503 (1987) for a description of homologous recombination vectors&rsqb;. The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line (e.g., by electroporation) and cells in which the introduced DNA has homologously recombined with the endogenous DNA are selected &lsqb;see e.g., Li et al., <highlight><italic>Cell, </italic></highlight>69:915 (1992)&rsqb;. The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal (e.g., a mouse or rat) to form aggregation chimeras &lsqb;see e.g., Bradley, in <highlight><italic>Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach</italic></highlight>, E. J. Robertson, ed. (IRL, Oxford, 1987), pp. 113-152&rsqb;. A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female foster animal and the embryo brought to term to create a &ldquo;knock out&rdquo; animal. Progeny harboring the homologously recombined DNA in their germ cells can be identified by standard techniques and used to breed animals in which all cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA. Knockout animals can be characterized for instance, for their ability to defend against certain pathological conditions and for their development of pathological conditions due to absence of the PRO polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3399&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid encoding the PRO polypeptides may also be used in gene therapy. In gene therapy applications, genes are introduced into cells in order to achieve in vivo synthesis of a therapeutically effective genetic product, for example for replacement of a defective gene. &ldquo;Gene therapy&rdquo; includes both conventional gene therapy where a lasting effect is achieved by a single treatment, and the administration of gene therapeutic agents, which involves the one time or repeated administration of a therapeutically effective DNA or mRNA. Antisense RNAs and DNAs can be used as therapeutic agents for blocking the expression of certain genes in vivo. It has already been shown that short antisense oligonucleotides can be imported into cells where they act as inhibitors, despite their low intracellular concentrations caused by their restricted uptake by the cell membrane. (Zamecnik et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>83:4143-4146 &lsqb;1986&rsqb;). The oligonucleotides can be modified to enhance their uptake, e.g. by substituting their negatively charged phosphodiester groups by uncharged groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3400&rsqb;</number> There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro, or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes, electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE-dextran, the calcium phosphate precipitation method, etc. The currently preferred in vivo gene transfer techniques include transfection with viral (typically retroviral) vectors and viral coat protein-liposome mediated transfection (Dzau et al., <highlight><italic>Trends in Biotechnology </italic></highlight>11, 205-210 &lsqb;1993&rsqb;). In some situations it is desirable to provide the nucleic acid source with an agent that targets the target cells, such as an antibody specific for a cell surface membrane protein or the target cell, a ligand for a receptor on the target cell, etc. Where liposomes are employed, proteins which bind to a cell surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be used for targeting and/or to facilitate uptake, e.g. capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type, antibodies for proteins which undergo internalization in cycling, proteins that target intracellular localization and enhance intracellular half-life. The technique of receptor-mediated endocytosis is described, for example, by Wu et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>262, 44294432 (1987); and Wagner et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>87, 3410-3414 (1990). For review of gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>256, 808-813 (1992). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3401&rsqb;</number> The PRO polypeptides described herein may also be employed as molecular weight markers for protein electrophoresis purposes and the isolated nucleic acid sequences may be used for recombinantly expressing those markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3402&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid molecules encoding the PRO polypeptides or fragments thereof described herein are useful for chromosome identification. In this regard, there exists an ongoing need to identify new chromosome markers, since relatively few chromosome marking reagents, based upon actual sequence data are presently available. Each PRO nucleic acid molecule of the present invention can be used as a chromosome marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3403&rsqb;</number> The PRO polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may also be used for tissue typing, wherein the PRO polypeptides of the present invention may be differentially expressed in one tissue as compared to another. PRO nucleic acid molecules will find use for generating probes for PCR, Northern analysis, Southern analysis and Western analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3404&rsqb;</number> The PRO polypeptides described herein may also be employed as therapeutic agents. The PRO polypeptides of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby the PRO product hereof is combined in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle. Therapeutic formulations are prepared for storage by mixing the active ingredient having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (<highlight><italic>Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences </italic></highlight>16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN&trade;, PLURONICS&trade; or PEG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3405&rsqb;</number> The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3406&rsqb;</number> Therapeutic compositions herein generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3407&rsqb;</number> The route of administration is in accord with known methods, e.g. injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial or intralesional routes, topical administration, or by sustained release systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3408&rsqb;</number> Dosages and desired drug concentrations of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may vary depending on the particular use envisioned. The determination of the appropriate dosage or route of administration is well within the skill of an ordinary physician. Animal experiments provide reliable guidance for the determination of effective doses for human therapy. Interspecies scaling of effective doses can be performed following the principles laid down by Mordenti, J. and Chappell, W. &ldquo;The use of interspecies scaling in toxicolinetics&rdquo; In Toxicokinetics and New Drug Development, Yacobi et al., Eds., Pergamon Press, New York 1989, pp. 42-96. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3409&rsqb;</number> When in vivo administration of a PRO polypeptide or agonist or antagonist thereof is employed, normal dosage amounts may vary from about 10 ng/kg to up to 100 mg/kg of mammal body weight or more per day, preferably about 1 &mgr;g/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day, depending upon the route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature; see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,657,760; 5,206,344; or 5,225,212. It is anticipated that different formulations will be effective for different treatment compounds and different disorders, that administration targeting one organ or tissue, for example, may necessitate delivery in a manner different from that to another organ or tissue. Where sustained-release administration of a PRO polypeptide is desired in a formulation with release characteristics suitable for the treatment of any disease or disorder requiring administration of the PRO polypeptide, microencapsulation of the PRO polypeptide is contemplated. Microencapsulation of recombinant proteins for sustained release has been successfully performed with human growth hormone (rhGH), interferon-(rhIFN- ), interleukin-2, and MN rgp120.

<paragraph id="P-3410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3410&rsqb;</number> The sustained-release formulations of these proteins were developed using poly-lactic-coglycolic acid (PLGA) polymer due to its biocompatibility and wide range of biodegradable properties. The degradation products of PLGA, lactic and glycolic acids, can be cleared quickly within the human body. Moreover, the degradability of this polymer can be adjusted from months to years depending on its molecular weight and composition. Lewis, &ldquo;Controlled release of bioactive agents from lactide/glycolide polymer,&rdquo; in: M. Chasin and R. Langer (Eds.), <highlight><italic>Biodegradable Polymers as Drug Delivery Systems </italic></highlight>(Marcel Dekker: New York, 1990), pp. 1-41. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3411&rsqb;</number> This invention encompasses methods of screening compounds to identify those that mimic the PRO polypeptide (agonists) or prevent the effect of the PRO polypeptide (antagonists). Screening assays for antagonist drug candidates are designed to identify compounds that bind or complex with the PRO polypeptides encoded by the genes identified herein, or otherwise interfere with the interaction of the encoded polypeptides with other cellular proteins. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high-throughput screening of chemical libraries, making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3412&rsqb;</number> The assays can be performed in a variety of formats, including protein-protein binding assays, biochemical screening assays, immunoassays, and cell-based assays, which are well characterized in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3413&rsqb;</number> All assays for antagonists are common in that they call for contacting the drug candidate with a PRO polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid identified herein under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow these two components to interact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3414&rsqb;</number> In binding assays, the interaction is binding and the complex formed can be isolated or detected in the reaction mixture. In a particular embodiment, the PRO polypeptide encoded by the gene identified herein or the drug candidate is immobilized on a solid phase, e.g., on a microtiter plate, by covalent or non-covalent attachments. Non-covalent attachment generally is accomplished by coating the solid surface with a solution of the PRO polypeptide and drying. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody, e.g., a monoclonal antibody, specific for the PRO polypeptide to be immobilized can be used to anchor it to a solid surface. The assay is performed by adding the non-immobilized component, which may be labeled by a detectable label, to the immobilized component, e.g., the coated surface containing the anchored component. When the reaction is complete, the non-reacted components are removed, e.g., by washing, and complexes anchored on the solid surface are detected. When the originally non-immobilized component carries a detectable label, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexing occurred. Where the originally non-immobilized component does not carry a label, complexing can be detected, for example, by using a labeled antibody specifically binding the immobilized complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3415&rsqb;</number> If the candidate compound interacts with but does not bind to a particular PRO polypeptide encoded by a gene identified herein, its interaction with that polypeptide can be assayed by methods well known for detecting protein-protein interactions. Such assays include traditional approaches, such as, e.g., cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-purification through gradients or chromatographic columns. In addition, protein-protein interactions can be monitored by using a yeast-based genetic system described by Fields and co-workers (Fields and Song, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>London</italic></highlight>), 340:245-246 (1989); Chien et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>88:9578-9582 (1991)) as disclosed by Chevray and Nathans, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>89: 5789-5793 (1991). Many transcriptional activators, such as yeast GAL4, consist of two physically discrete modular domains, one acting as the DNA-binding domain, the other one functioning as the transcription-activation domain. The yeast expression system described in the foregoing publications (generally referred to as the &ldquo;two-hybrid system&rdquo;) takes advantage of this property, and employs two hybrid proteins, one in which the target protein is fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, and another, in which candidate activating proteins are fused to the activation domain. The expression of a GAL1-lacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4-activated promoter depends on reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein-protein interaction. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected with a chromogenic substrate for &bgr;-galactosidase. A complete kit (MATCHMAKERT&trade;) for identifying protein-protein interactions between two specific proteins using the two-hybrid technique is commercially available from Clontech. This system can also be extended to map protein domains involved in specific protein interactions as well as to pinpoint amino acid residues that are crucial for these interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3416&rsqb;</number> Compounds that interfere with the interaction of a gene encoding a PRO polypeptide identified herein and other intra- or extracellular components can be tested as follows: usually a reaction mixture is prepared containing the product of the gene and the intra- or extracellular component under conditions and for a time allowing for the interaction and binding of the two products. To test the ability of a candidate compound to inhibit binding, the reaction is run in the absence and in the presence of the test compound. In addition, a placebo may be added to a third reaction mixture, to serve as positive control. The binding (complex formation) between the test compound and the intra- or extracellular component present in the mixture is monitored as described hereinabove. The formation of a complex in the control reaction(s) but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction of the test compound and its reaction partner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3417&rsqb;</number> To assay for antagonists, the PRO polypeptide may be added to a cell along with the compound to be screened for a particular activity and the ability of the compound to inhibit the activity of interest in the presence of the PRO polypeptide indicates that the compound is an antagonist to the PRO polypeptide. Alternatively, antagonists may be detected by combining the PRO polypeptide and a potential antagonist with membrane-bound PRO polypeptide receptors or recombinant receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. The PRO polypeptide can be labeled, such as by radioactivity, such that the number of PRO polypeptide molecules bound to the receptor can be used to determine the effectiveness of the potential antagonist. The gene encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, ligand panning and FACS sorting. Coligan et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Immun., </italic></highlight>1(2): Chapter 5 (1991). Preferably, expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the PRO polypeptide and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the PRO polypeptide. Transfected cells that are grown on glass slides are exposed to labeled PRO polypeptide. The PRO polypeptide can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site-specific protein kinase. Following fixation and incubation, the slides are subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub-pools are prepared and re-transfected using an interactive sub-pooling and re-screening process, eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3418&rsqb;</number> As an alternative approach for receptor identification, labeled PRO polypeptide can be photoaffinity-linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross-linked material is resolved by PAGE and exposed to X-ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptor can be excised, resolved into peptide fragments, and subjected to protein micro-sequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from micro-sequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the gene encoding the putative receptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3419&rsqb;</number> In another assay for antagonists, mammalian cells or a membrane preparation expressing the receptor would be incubated with labeled PRO polypeptide in the presence of the candidate compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3420&rsqb;</number> More specific examples of potential antagonists include an oligonucleotide that binds to the fusions of immunoglobulin with PRO polypeptide, and, in particular, antibodies including, without limitation, poly- and monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments, single-chain antibodies, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and chimeric or humanized versions of such antibodies or fragments, as well as human antibodies and antibody fragments. Alternatively, a potential antagonist may be a closely related protein, for example, a mutated form of the PRO polypeptide that recognizes the receptor but imparts no effect, thereby competitively inhibiting the action of the PRO polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3421&rsqb;</number> Another potential PRO polypeptide antagonist is an antisense RNA or DNA construct prepared using antisense technology, where, e.g., an antisense RNA or DNA molecule acts to block directly the translation of mRNA by hybridizing to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple-helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA, both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example, the 5&prime; coding portion of the polynucleotide sequence, which encodes the mature PRO polypeptides herein, is used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription (triple helix&mdash;see Lee et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res., </italic></highlight>6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>241: 456 (1988); Dervan et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>251:1360 (1991)), thereby preventing transcription and the production of the PRO polypeptide. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into the PRO polypeptide (antisense&mdash;Okano, <highlight><italic>Neurochem., </italic></highlight>56:560 (1991); <highlight><italic>Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression </italic></highlight>(CRC Press: Boca Raton, Fla., 1988). The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of the PRO polypeptide. When antisense DNA is used, oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the translation-initiation site, e.g., between about &minus;10 and &plus;10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence, are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3422&rsqb;</number> Potential antagonists include small molecules that bind to the active site, the receptor binding site, or growth factor or other relevant binding site of the PRO polypeptide, thereby blocking the normal biological activity of the PRO polypeptide. Examples of small molecules include, but are not limited to, small peptides or peptide-like molecules, preferably soluble peptides, and synthetic non-peptidyl organic or inorganic compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3423" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3423&rsqb;</number> Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act by sequence-specific hybridization to the complementary target RNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within a potential RNA target can be identified by known techniques. For further details see, e.g., Rossi, <highlight><italic>Current Biology, </italic></highlight>4:469-471 (1994), and PCT publication No. WO 97/33551 (published Sep. 18, 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3424&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid molecules in triple-helix formation used to inhibit transcription should be single-stranded and composed of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of these oligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple-helix formation via Hoogsteen base-pairing rules, which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines on one strand of a duplex. For further details see, e.g., PCT publication No. WO 97/33551, supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3425&rsqb;</number> These small molecules can be identified by any one or more of the screening assays discussed hereinabove and/or by any other screening techniques well known for those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3426&rsqb;</number> Uses of the herein disclosed molecules may also be based upon the positive functional assay hits disclosed and described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3427&rsqb;</number> F. Anti-PRO Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3428&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides anti-PRO antibodies. Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, bispecific, and heteroconjugate antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3429" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3429&rsqb;</number> 1. Polyclonal Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3430&rsqb;</number> The anti-PRO antibodies may comprise polyclonal antibodies. Methods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known to the skilled artisan. Polyclonal antibodies can be raised in a mammal, for example, by one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Typically, the immunizing agent and/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. The immunizing agent may include the PRO polypeptide or a fusion protein thereof. It may be useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Examples of such immunogenic proteins include but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Examples of adjuvants which may be employed include Freund&apos;s complete adjuvant and MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl Lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate). The immunization protocol may be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3431&rsqb;</number> 2. Monoclonal Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3432&rsqb;</number> The anti-PRO antibodies may, alternatively, be monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>256:495 (1975). In a hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3433&rsqb;</number> The immunizing agent will typically include the PRO polypeptide or a fusion protein thereof. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes (&ldquo;PBLs&rdquo;) are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell &lsqb;Goding, <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice</italic></highlight>, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103&rsqb;. Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (&ldquo;HAT medium&rdquo;), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3434&rsqb;</number> Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies &lsqb;Kozbor, <highlight><italic>J. Immunol., </italic></highlight>133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications</italic></highlight>, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3435&rsqb;</number> The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against PRO. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem., </italic></highlight>107:220 (1980). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3436&rsqb;</number> After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods &lsqb;Goding, supra&rsqb;. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco&apos;s Modified Eagle&apos;s Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3437&rsqb;</number> The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3438&rsqb;</number> The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences &lsqb;U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., supra&rsqb; or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3439&rsqb;</number> The antibodies may be monovalent antibodies. Methods for preparing monovalent antibodies are well known in the art. For example, one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. Alternatively, the relevant cysteine residues are substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3440&rsqb;</number> In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly, Fab fragments, can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3441&rsqb;</number> 3. Human and Humanized Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3442&rsqb;</number> The anti-PRO antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab&prime;, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin &lsqb;Jones et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, <highlight><italic>Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., </italic></highlight>2:593-596 (1992)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3443&rsqb;</number> Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as &ldquo;import&rdquo; residues, which are typically taken from an &ldquo;import&rdquo; variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers &lsqb;Jones et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>239: 1534-1536 (1988)&rsqb;, by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such &ldquo;humanized&rdquo; antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3444&rsqb;</number> Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage display libraries &lsqb;Hoogenboom and Winter, <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>227;381 (1991); Marks et al., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>222:581 (1991)&rsqb;. The techniques of Cole et al. and Boemer et al. are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy</italic></highlight>, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985) and Boemer et al., <highlight><italic>J. Immunol., </italic></highlight>147(1):86-95 (1991)&rsqb;. Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing of human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al., <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>10, 779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>368 856-859 (1994); Morrison, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>368, 812-13 (1994); Fishwild et al., <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnologv </italic></highlight>14, 845-51 (1996); Neuberger, <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnology </italic></highlight>14, 826 (1996); Lonberg and Huszar, <highlight><italic>Intern. Rev. Immunol. </italic></highlight>13 65-93 (1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3445&rsqb;</number> 4. Bispecific Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3446&rsqb;</number> Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for the PRO, the other one is for any other antigen, and preferably for a cell-surface protein or receptor or receptor subunit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3447&rsqb;</number> Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light-chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities &lsqb;Milstein and Cuello, <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>305:537-539 (1983)&rsqb;. Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, published May 13, 1993, and in Traunecker et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J., </italic></highlight>10:3655-3659 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3448&rsqb;</number> Antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) can be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology, </italic></highlight>121:210 (1986). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3449&rsqb;</number> According to another approach described in WO 96/27011, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory &ldquo;cavities&rdquo; of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3450&rsqb;</number> Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>bispecific antibodies). Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>229:81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab&prime; fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab&prime;-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab&prime;-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab&prime;-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3451&rsqb;</number> Fab&prime; fragments may be directly recovered from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., <highlight><italic>J. Exp. Med. </italic></highlight>175:217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>molecule. Each Fab&prime; fragment was separately secreted from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3452&rsqb;</number> Various technique for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., <highlight><italic>J. Immunol. </italic></highlight>148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab&prime; portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The &ldquo;diabody&rdquo; technology described by Hollinger et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See, Gruber et al., <highlight><italic>J. Immunol. </italic></highlight>152:5368 (1994). Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., <highlight><italic>J. Immunol. </italic></highlight>147:60 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3453&rsqb;</number> Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes on a given PRO polypeptide herein. Alternatively, an anti-PRO polypeptide arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD2, CD3, CD28, or B7), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc&ggr;R), such as Fc&ggr;RI (CD64), Fc&ggr;RII (CD32) and Fc&ggr;RIII (CD16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular PRO polypeptide. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular PRO polypeptide. These antibodies possess a PRO-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA, or TETA. Another bispecific antibody of interest binds the PRO polypeptide and further binds tissue factor (TF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3454&rsqb;</number> 5. Heteroconugate Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3455" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3455&rsqb;</number> Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells &lsqb;U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980&rsqb;, and for treatment of HIV infection &lsqb;WO 91/00360; WO 92/200373; EP 03089&rsqb;. It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3456" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3456&rsqb;</number> 6. Effector Function Engineering </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3457" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3457&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, so as to enhance, e.g., the effectiveness of the antibody in treating cancer. For example, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced into the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al., <highlight><italic>J. Exp Med., </italic></highlight>176: 1191-1195(1992) and Shopes, <highlight><italic>J. Immunol., </italic></highlight>148: 2918-2922(1992). Homodineric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>53: 2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered that has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al., <highlight><italic>Anti-Cancer Drug Design. </italic></highlight>3: 219-230 (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3458" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3458&rsqb;</number> 7. Immunoconjugates </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3459&rsqb;</number> The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3460&rsqb;</number> Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from <highlight><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></highlight>), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, <highlight><italic>Aleurites fordii </italic></highlight>proteins, dianthin proteins, <highlight><italic>Phytolaca americana </italic></highlight>proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include <highlight><superscript>212</superscript></highlight>Bi, <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>In, <highlight><superscript>90</superscript></highlight>Y, and <highlight><superscript>186</superscript></highlight>Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-aziido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl)hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3461" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3461&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a &ldquo;receptor&rdquo; (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a &ldquo;ligand&rdquo; (e.g., avidin) that is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3462" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3462&rsqb;</number> 8. Immunoliposomes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3463" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3463&rsqb;</number> The antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>82: 3688 (1985); Hwang et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>77: 4030 (1980); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3464&rsqb;</number> Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse-phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab&prime; fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>257: 286-288 (1982) via a disulfide-interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent (such as Doxorubicin) is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al., <highlight><italic>J. National Cancer Inst., </italic></highlight>81(19): 1484 (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3465" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3465&rsqb;</number> 9. Pharmaceutical Compositions of Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3466" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3466&rsqb;</number> Antibodies specifically binding a PRO polypeptide identified herein, as well as other molecules identified by the screening assays disclosed hereinbefore, can be administered for the treatment of various disorders in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3467&rsqb;</number> If the PRO polypeptide is intracellular and whole antibodies are used as inhibitors, internalizing antibodies are preferred. However, lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody, or an antibody fragment, into cells. Where antibody fragments are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example, based upon the variable-region sequences of an antibody, peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See, e.g., Marasco et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>90: 7889-7893 (1993). T h e formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition may comprise an agent that enhances its function, such as, for example, a cytotoxic agent, cytoline, chemotherapeutic agent, or growth-inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3468&rsqb;</number> The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles, and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in <highlight><italic>Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences</italic></highlight>, supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3469&rsqb;</number> The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3470&rsqb;</number> Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and &ggr; ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT&trade; (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(&minus;)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37&deg; C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S&mdash;S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3471&rsqb;</number> G. Uses for anti-PRO Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3472&rsqb;</number> The anti-PRO antibodies of the invention have various utilities. For example, anti-PRO antibodies may be used in diagnostic assays for PRO, e.g., detecting its expression in specific cells, tissues, or serum. Various diagnostic assay techniques known in the art may be used, such as competitive binding assays, direct or indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays conducted in either heterogeneous or homogeneous phases &lsqb;Zola, <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques</italic></highlight>, CRC Press, Inc. (1987) pp. 147-158&rsqb;. The antibodies used in the diagnostic assays can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety should be capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H, <highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>C, <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P, <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S, or <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodanine, or luciferin, or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase or horseradish peroxidase. Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>144:945 (1962); David et al., <highlight><italic>Biochemistry, </italic></highlight>13:1014 (1974); Pain et al., <highlight><italic>J. Immunol. Meth., </italic></highlight>40:219 (1981); and Nygren, <highlight><italic>J. Histochem. and Cytochem., </italic></highlight>30:407 (1982). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3473&rsqb;</number> Anti-PRO antibodies also are useful for the affinity purification of PRO from recombinant cell culture or natural sources. In this process, the antibodies against PRO are immobilized on a suitable support, such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody then is contacted with a sample containing the PRO to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the PRO, which is bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent that will release the PRO from the antibody. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Extracellular Domain Homology Screening to Identify Novel Polypeptides and cDNA Encoding Therefor </heading>
<paragraph id="P-3477" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3477&rsqb;</number> The extracellular domain (ECD) sequences (including the secretion signal sequence, if any) from about 950 known secreted proteins from the Swiss-Prot public database were used to search EST databases. The EST databases included public databases (e.g., Dayhoff, GenBank), and proprietary databases (e.g. LIFESEQ&trade;, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, Calif.). The search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST-2 (Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>266:460-480 (1996)) as a comparison of the ECD protein sequences to a 6 frame translation of the EST sequences. Those comparisons with a BLAST score of 70 (or in some cases 90) or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into consensus DNA sequences with the program &ldquo;phrap&rdquo; (Phil Green, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3478" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3478&rsqb;</number> Using this extracellular domain homology screen, consensus DNA sequences were assembled relative to the other identified EST sequences using phrap. In addition, the consensus DNA sequences obtained were often (but not always) extended using repeated cycles of BLAST or BLAST-2 and phrap to extend the consensus sequence as far as possible using the sources of EST sequences discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3479" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3479&rsqb;</number> Based upon the consensus sequences obtained as described above, oligonucleotides were then synthesized and used to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest and for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full-length coding sequence for a PRO polypeptide. Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100-1000 bp in length. The probe sequences are typically 40-55 bp in length. In some cases, additional oligonucleotides are synthesized when the consensus sequence is greater than about 1-1.5 kbp. In order to screen several libraries for a full-length clone, DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification, as per Ausubel et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, with the PCR primer pair. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the gene of interest using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the primer pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3480" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3480&rsqb;</number> The cDNA libraries used to isolate the cDNA clones were constructed by standard methods using commercially available reagents such as those from Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif. The cDNA was primed with oligo dT containing a NotI site, linked with blunt to SalI hernikinased adaptors, cleaved with NotI, sized appropriately by gel electrophoresis, and cloned in a defined orientation into a suitable cloning vector (such as pRKB or pRKD; pRK5B is a precursor of pRK5D that does not contain the SfiI site; see, Holmes et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>253:1278-1280 (1991)) in the unique XhoI and NotI sites. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-3481" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3481&rsqb;</number> 1. Preparation of Oligo dT Primed cDNA Library </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3482" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3482&rsqb;</number> mRNA was isolated from a human tissue of interest using reagents and protocols from Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif. (Fast Track 2). This RNA was used to generate an oligo dT primed cDNA library in the vector pRK5D using reagents and protocols from Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md. (Super Script Plasmid System). In this procedure, the double stranded cDNA was sized to greater than 1000 bp and the SalI/NotI Tinkered cDNA was cloned into XhoI/NotI cleaved vector. pRK5D is a cloning vector that has an sp6 transcription initiation site followed by an SfiI restriction enzyme site preceding the XhoI/NotI cDNA cloning sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3483" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3483&rsqb;</number> 2. Preparation of Random Primed cDNA Library </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3484" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3484&rsqb;</number> A secondary cDNA library was generated in order to preferentially represent the 5&prime; ends of the primary cDNA clones. Sp6 RNA was generated from the primary library (described above), and this RNA was used to generate a random primed cDNA library in the vector pSST-AMY.0 using reagents and protocols from Life Technologies (Super Script Plasmid System, referenced above). In this procedure the double stranded cDNA was sized to 500-1000 bp, Tinkered with blunt to NotI adaptors, cleaved with SfiI, and cloned into SfiI/NotI cleaved vector. pSST-AMY.0 is a cloning vector that has a yeast alcohol dehydrogenase promoter preceding the cDNA cloning sites and the mouse amylase sequence (the mature sequence without the secretion signal) followed by the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase terminator, after the cloning sites. Thus, cDNAs cloned into this vector that are fused in frame with amylase sequence will lead to the secretion of amylase from appropriately transfected yeast colonies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3485" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3485&rsqb;</number> 3. Transformation and Detection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3486" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3486&rsqb;</number> DNA from the library described in paragraph 2 above was chilled on ice to which was added electrocompetent DH10B bacteria (Life Technologies, 20 ml). The bacteria and vector mixture was then electroporated as recommended by the manufacturer. Subsequently, SOC media (Life Technologies, 1 ml) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37&deg; C. for 30 minutes. The transformants were then plated onto 20 standard 150 mm LB plates containing ampicillin and incubated for 16 hours (37&deg; C.). Positive colonies were scraped off the plates and the DNA was isolated from the bacterial pellet using standard protocols, e.g. CsC1-gradient. The purified DNA was then carried on to the yeast protocols below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3487" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3487&rsqb;</number> The yeast methods were divided into three categories: (1) Transformation of yeast with the plasmid/cDNA combined vector; (2) Detection and isolation of yeast clones secreting amylase; and (3) PCR amplification of the insert directly from the yeast colony and purification of the DNA for sequencing and further analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3488" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3488&rsqb;</number> The yeast strain used was HD56-5A (ATCC-90785). This strain has the following genotype: MAT alpha, ura3-52, leu2-3, leu2-112, his3-11, his3-15, MAL<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, SUC<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, GAL<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>. Preferably, yeast mutants can be employed that have deficient post-translational pathways. Such mutants may have translocation deficient alleles in sec71, sec72, sec62, with truncated sec71 being most preferred. Alternatively, antagonists (including antisense nucleotides and/or ligands) which interfere with the normal operation of these genes, other proteins implicated in this post translation pathway (e.g., SEC61p, SEC72p, SEC62p, SEC63p, TDJ1p or SSA1p-4p) or the complex formation of these proteins may also be preferably employed in combination with the amylase-expressing yeast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3489" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3489&rsqb;</number> Transformation was performed based on the protocol outlined by Gietz et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acid. Res., </italic></highlight>20:1425 (1992). Transformed cells were then inoculated from agar into YEPD complex media broth (100 ml) and grown overnight at 30&deg; C. The YEPD broth was prepared as described in Kaiser et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Yeast Genetics</italic></highlight>, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., p. 207 (1994). The overnight culture was then diluted to about 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml (approx. OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.1) into fresh YEPD broth (500 ml) and regrown to 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml (approx. OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.4-0.5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3490" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3490&rsqb;</number> The cells were then harvested and prepared for transformation by transfer into GS3 rotor bottles in a Sorval GS3 rotor at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant discarded, and then resuspended into sterile water, and centrifuged again in 50 ml falcon tubes at 3,500 rpm in a Beckman GS-6KR centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were subsequently washed with LiAc/TE (10 ml, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5, 100 mM Li<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>OOCCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), and resuspended into LiAc/TE (2.5 ml). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3491" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3491&rsqb;</number> Transformation took place by mixing the prepared cells (100 &mgr;l) with freshly denatured single stranded salmon testes DNA (Lofstrand Labs, Gaithersburg, Md.) and transforming DNA (1 &mgr;g, vol.&lt;10 &mgr;l) in microfuge tubes. The mixture was mixed briefly by vortexing, then 40% PEG/TE (600 &mgr;l, 40% polyethylene glycol-4000, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM Li<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>OOCCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, pH 7.5) was added. This mixture was gently mixed and incubated at 30&deg; C. while agitating for 30 minutes. The cells were then heat shocked at 42&deg; C. for 15 minutes, and the reaction vessel centrifuged in a microfuge at 12,000 rpm for 5-10 seconds, decanted and resuspended into TE (500 &mgr;l, 10 mM Tris-HCI, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5) followed by recentrifugation. The cells were then diluted into TE (1 ml) and aliquots (200 &mgr;l) were spread onto the selective media previously prepared in 150 mm growth plates (VWR). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3492" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3492&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, instead of multiple small reactions, the transformation was performed using a single, large scale reaction, wherein reagent amounts were scaled up accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3493" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3493&rsqb;</number> The selective media used was a synthetic complete dextrose agar lacking uracil (SCD-Ura) prepared as described in Kaiser et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Yeast Genetics</italic></highlight>, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., p. 208-210 (1994). Transformants were grown at 30&deg; C. for 2-3 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3494" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3494&rsqb;</number> The detection of colonies secreting amylase was performed by including red starch in the selective growth media. Starch was coupled to the red dye (Reactive Red-120, Sigma) as per the procedure described by Biely et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem., </italic></highlight>172:176-179 (1988). The coupled starch was incorporated into the SCD-Ura agar plates at a final concentration of 0.15% (w/v), and was buffered with potassium phosphate to a pH of 7.0 (50-100 mM final concentration). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3495" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3495&rsqb;</number> The positive colonies were picked and streaked across fresh selective media (onto 150 mm plates) in order to obtain well isolated and identifiable single colonies. Well isolated single colonies positive for amylase secretion were detected by direct incorporation of red starch into buffered SCD-Ura agar. Positive colonies were determined by their ability to break down starch resulting in a clear halo around the positive colony visualized directly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-3497" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3497&rsqb;</number> When a positive colony was isolated, a portion of it was picked by a toothpick and diluted into sterile water (30 &mgr;l) in a 96 well plate. At this time, the positive colonies were either frozen and stored for subsequent analysis or immediately amplified. An aliquot of cells (5 &mgr;l) was used as a template for the PCR reaction in a 25 &mgr;l volume containing: 0.5 &mgr;l Klentaq (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.); 4.0 &mgr;l 10 mM dNTP&apos;s (Perkin Elmer-Cetus); 2.5 &mgr;l Kentaq buffer (Clontech); 0.25 &mgr;l forward oligo 1; 0.25 &mgr;l reverse oligo 2; 12.5 &mgr;l distilled water.

<paragraph id="P-3503" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3503&rsqb;</number> Various polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequences were identified by applying a proprietary signal sequence finding algorithm developed by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif.) upon ESTs as well as clustered and assembled EST fragments from public (e.g., GenBank) and/or private (LIFESEQ&reg;, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.) databases. The signal sequence algorithm computes a secretion signal score based on the character of the DNA nucleotides surrounding the first and optionally the second methionine codon(s) (ATG) at the 5&prime;-end of the sequence or sequence fragment under consideration. The nucleotides following the first ATG must code for at least 35 unambiguous amino acids without any stop codons. If the first ATG has the required amino acids, the second is not examined. If neither meets the requirement, the candidate sequence is not scored. In order to determine whether the EST sequence contains an authentic signal sequence, the DNA and corresponding amino acid sequences surrounding the ATG codon are scored using a set of seven sensors (evaluation parameters) known to be associated with secretion signals. Use of this algorithm resulted in the identification of numerous polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequences. </paragraph>

The DNA14232 sequence is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:15). Based on the DNA 14232 sequence, oligonucleotides were synthesized: 1) to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest, and 2) for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full-length coding sequence for PRO190. Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100-1000 bp in length. The probe sequences are typically 40-55 bp in length. In order to screen several libraries for a full-length clone, DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification, as per Ausubel et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, with the PCR primer pair.

<paragraph id="P-3596" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3596&rsqb;</number> A yeast screening assay was employed to identify cDNA clones that encoded potential secreted proteins. Use of this yeast screening assay allowed identification of a single cDNA clone whose sequence (herein designated as DNA42580) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:77). The DNA42580 sequence was then compared to a variety of known EST sequences to identify homologies. The EST databases employed included public EST databases (e.g., GenBank) and a proprietary EST DNA database (LIFESEQ&trade;, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, Calif.). The search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST2 (Altshul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>266:460480 (1996)) as a comparison to a 6 frame translation of the EST sequence. Those comparisons resulting in a BLAST score of 70 (or in some cases 90) or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into consensus DNA sequences with the program &ldquo;phrap&rdquo; (Phil Green, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3597" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3597&rsqb;</number> Using the above analysis, a consensus DNA sequence was assembled relative to other EST sequences using phrap. This consensus sequence is herein designated consen01.

<paragraph id="P-3598" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3598&rsqb;</number> Based on the consen01 sequence, oligonucleotides were synthesized: 1) to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest, and 2) for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full-length coding sequence for PRO732. Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100-1000 bp in length. The probe sequences are typically 40-55 bp in length. In some cases, additional oligonucleotides are synthesized when the consensus sequence is greater than about 1-1.5 kbp. In order to screen several libraries for a full-length clone, DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification, as per Ausubel et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, with the PCR primer pair.

This consensus sequence is designated herein consen0352. The consen0352 sequence was then extended using repeated cycles of BLAST and phrap to extend the consensus sequence as far as possible using the sources of EST sequences discussed above. The extended consensus sequence is designated herein as DNA34365. Based on the DNA34365 consensus sequence, oligonucleotides were synthesized: 1) to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest, and 2) for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full-length coding sequence for PRO1120.

<paragraph id="P-3662" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3662&rsqb;</number> A yeast screening assay was employed to identify cDNA clones that encoded potential secreted proteins. Use of this yeast screening assay allowed identification of a single cDNA clone, designated herein as DNA45201 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</cross-reference>; SEQ ID NO:139). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-3663" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;3663&rsqb;</number> The DNA45201 sequence was then used to search expressed sequence tag (EST) databases for the presence of potential homologies. The EST databases included public EST databases (e.g., GenBank) and a proprietary EST DNA database (LIFESEQ&trade;, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, Calif.). The search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST2 (Altshul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>266:460-480 (1996)). Those comparisons resulting in a BLAST score of 70 (or in some cases 90) or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into a consensus DNA sequence with the program &ldquo;phrap&rdquo; (Phil Green, Univ. of Washington, Seattle, Wash.). The consensus sequence obtained is herein designated as &ldquo;consen01&rdquo;. A proprietary Genentech EST sequence was used in the consensus assembly and is herein designated as DNA14575 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</cross-reference>; SEQ ID NO:140). </paragraph>

In order to screen several libraries for a full-length clone, DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification, as per Ausubel et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, with the PCR primer pair. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the gene of interest using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the primer pairs.

This cluster sequence was then compared to a variety of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases which included public EST databases (e.g., GenBank) and a proprietary EST DNA database (LIFESEQ&trade;, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, Calif.) to identify existing homologies. The homology search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST2 (Altshul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>266:460-480 (1996)). Those comparisons resulting in a BLAST score of 70 (or in some cases 90) or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into a consensus DNA sequence with the program &ldquo;phrap&rdquo; (Phil Green, Univ. of Washington, Seattle, Wash.). The consensus sequence obtained therefrom is herein designated DNA56251. </paragraph>

Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100-1000 bp in length. The probe sequences are typically 40-55 bp in length. In some cases, additional oligonucleotides are synthesized when the consensus sequence is greater than about 1-1.5 kbp. In order to screen several libraries for a full-length clone, DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification, as per Ausubel et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, supra, with the PCR primer pair. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the gene of interest using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the primer pairs.

<heading lvl="1">Expression of PRO in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight></heading>
<paragraph id="P-4154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4154&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates preparation of an unglycosylated form of PRO by recombinant expression in <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4155&rsqb;</number> The DNA sequence encoding PRO is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers should contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector. A variety of expression vectors may be employed. An example of a suitable vector is pBR322 (derived from <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>; see Bolivar et al., <highlight><italic>Gene, </italic></highlight>2:95 (1977)) which contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance. The vector is digested with restriction enzyme and dephosphorylated. The PCR amplified sequences are then ligated into the vector. The vector will preferably include sequences which encode for an antibiotic resistance gene, a trp promoter, a polyhis leader (including the first six STII codons, polyhis sequence, and enterokinase cleavage site), the PRO coding region, lambda transcriptional terminator, and an argU gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4156&rsqb;</number> The ligation mixture is then used to transform a selected <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain using the methods described in Sambrook et al., supra. Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates and antibiotic resistant colonies are then selected. Plasmid DNA can be isolated and confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4157&rsqb;</number> Selected clones can be grown overnight in liquid culture medium such as LB broth supplemented with antibiotics. The overnight culture may subsequently be used to inoculate a larger scale culture. The cells are then grown to a desired optical density, during which the expression promoter is turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4158&rsqb;</number> After culturing the cells for several more hours, the cells can be harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet obtained by the centrifugation can be solubilized using various agents known in the art, and the solubilized PRO protein can then be purified using a metal chelating column under conditions that allow tight binding of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4159&rsqb;</number> PRO may be expressed in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>in a poly-His tagged form, using the following procedure. The DNA encoding PRO is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers will contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector, and other useful sequences providing for efficient and reliable translation initiation, rapid purification on a metal chelation column, and proteolytic removal with enterokinase. The PCR-amplified, poly-His tagged sequences are then ligated into an expression vector, which is used to transform an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>host based on strain 52 (W3110 fuhA(tonA) Ion galE rpoHts(htpRts) cIpP(lacIq). Transformants are first grown in LB containing 50 mg/ml carbenicillin at 30&deg; C. with shaking until an O.D.600 of 3-5 is reached. Cultures are then diluted 50-100 fold into CRAP media (prepared by mixing 3.57 g (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 0.71 g sodium citrate.2H2O, 1.07 g KCl, 5.36 g Difco yeast extract, 5.36 g Sheffield hycase SF in 500 mL water, as well as 110 mM MPOS, pH 7.3, 0.55% (w/v) glucose and 7 mM MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) and grown for approximately 20-30 hours at 30&deg; C. with shaking. Samples are removed to verify expression by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the bulk culture is centrifuged to pellet the cells. Cell pellets are frozen until purification and refolding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4160&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>paste from 0.5 to 1 L fermentations (6-10 g pellets) is resuspended in 10 volumes (w/v) in 7 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, pH 8 buffer. Solid sodium sulfite and sodium tetrathionate is added to make final concentrations of 0.1M and 0.02 M, respectively, and the solution is stirred overnight at 4&deg; C. This step results in a denatured protein with all cysteine residues blocked by sulfitolization. The solution is centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ultracentifuge for 30 min. The supernatant is diluted with 3-5 volumes of metal chelate column buffer (6 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) and filtered through 0.22 micron filters to clarify. The clarified extract is loaded onto a 5 ml Qiagen Ni-NTA metal chelate column equilibrated in the metal chelate column buffer. The column is washed with additional buffer containing 50 mM imidazole (Calbiochem, Utrol grade), pH 7.4. The protein is eluted with buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the desired protein are pooled and stored at 4&deg; C. Protein concentration is estimated by its absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficient based on its amino acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4161&rsqb;</number> The proteins are refolded by diluting the sample slowly into freshly prepared refolding buffer consisting of: 20 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 0.3 M NaCl, 2.5 M urea, 5 mM cysteine, 20 mM glycine and 1 mM EDTA. Refolding volumes are chosen so that the final protein concentration is between 50 to 100 micrograms/ml. The refolding solution is stirred gently at 4&deg; C. for 12-36 hours. The refolding reaction is quenched by the addition of TFA to a final concentration of 0.4% (pH of approximately 3). Before further purification of the protein, the solution is filtered through a 0.22 micron filter and acetonitrile is added to 2-10% final concentration. The refolded protein is chromatographed on a Poros R1/H reversed phase column using a mobile buffer of 0.1% TFA with elution with a gradient of acetonitrile from 10 to 80%. Aliquots of fractions with A280 absorbance are analyzed on SDS polyacrylamide gels and fractions containing homogeneous refolded protein are pooled. Generally, the properly refolded species of most proteins are eluted at the lowest concentrations of acetonitrile since those species are the most compact with their hydrophobic interiors shielded from interaction with the reversed phase resin. Aggregated species are usually eluted at higher acetonitrile concentrations. In addition to resolving misfolded forms of proteins from the desired form, the reversed phase step also removes endotoxin from the samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4162&rsqb;</number> Fractions containing the desired folded PRO polypeptide are pooled and the acetonitrile removed using a gentle stream of nitrogen directed at the solution. Proteins are formulated into 20 mM Hepes, pH 6.8 with 0.14 M sodium chloride and 4% mannitol by dialysis or by gel filtration using G25 Superfine (Pharmacia) resins equilibrated in the formulation buffer and sterile filtered. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4164&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates preparation of a potentially glycosylated form of PRO by recombinant expression in mammalian cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4165&rsqb;</number> The vector, pRK5 (see EP 307,247, published Mar. 15, 1989), is employed as the expression vector. Optionally, the PRO DNA is ligated into pRK5 with selected restriction enzymes to allow insertion of the PRO DNA using ligation methods such as described in Sambrook et al., supra. The resulting vector is called pRK5-PRO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4166&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the selected host cells may be 293 cells. Human 293 cells (ATCC CCL 1573) are grown to confluence in tissue culture plates in medium such as DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum and optionally, nutrient components and/or antibiotics. About 10 &mgr;g pRK5-PRO DNA is mixed with about 1 &mgr;g DNA encoding the VA RNA gene &lsqb;Thimmappaya et al., <highlight><italic>Cell, </italic></highlight>31:543 (1982)&rsqb; and dissolved in 500 &mgr;l of 1 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.227 M CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. To this mixture is added, dropwise, 500 &mgr;l of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.35), 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM NaPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and a precipitate is allowed to form for 10 minutes at 25&deg; C. The precipitate is suspended and added to the 293 cells and allowed to settle for about four hours at 37&deg; C. The culture medium is aspirated off and 2 ml of 20% glycerol in PBS is added for 30 seconds. The 293 cells are then washed with serum free medium, fresh medium is added and the cells are incubated for about 5 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4167&rsqb;</number> Approximately 24 hours after the transfections, the culture medium is removed and replaced with culture medium (alone) or culture medium containing 200 &mgr;Ci/ml <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-cysteine and 200 &mgr;Ci/ml <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-methionine. After a 12 hour incubation, the conditioned medium is collected, concentrated on a spin filter, and loaded onto a 15% SDS gel. The processed gel may be dried and exposed to film for a selected period of time to reveal the presence of PRO polypeptide. The cultures containing transfected cells may undergo further incubation (in serum free medium) and the medium is tested in selected bioassays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4168&rsqb;</number> In an alternative technique, PRO may be introduced into 293 cells transiently using the dextran sulfate method described by Somparyrac et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., </italic></highlight>12:7575 (1981). 293 cells are grown to maximal density in a spinner flask and 700 &mgr;g pRK5-PRO DNA is added. The cells are first concentrated from the spinner flask by centrifugation and washed with PBS. The DNA-dextran precipitate is incubated on the cell pellet for four hours. The cells are treated with 20% glycerol for 90 seconds, washed with tissue culture medium, and re-introduced into the spinner flask containing tissue culture medium, 5 &mgr;g/ml bovine insulin and 0.1 &mgr;g/ml bovine transferrin. After about four days, the conditioned media is centrifuged and filtered to remove cells and debris. The sample containing expressed PRO can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method, such as dialysis and/or column chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4169&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, PRO can be expressed in CHO cells. The pRK5-PRO can be transfected into CHO cells using known reagents such as CaPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or DEAE-dextran. As described above, the cell cultures can be incubated, and the medium replaced with culture medium (alone) or medium containing a radiolabel such as <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-methionine. After determining the presence of PRO polypeptide, the culture medium may be replaced with serum free medium. Preferably, the cultures are incubated for about 6 days, and then the conditioned medium is harvested. The medium containing the expressed PRO can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4170&rsqb;</number> Epitope-tagged PRO may also be expressed in host CHO cells. The PRO may be subcloned out of the pRK5 vector. The subclone insert can undergo PCR to fuse in frame with a selected epitope tag such as a poly-his tag into a Baculovirus expression vector. The poly-his tagged PRO insert can then be subcloned into a SV40 driven vector containing a selection marker such as DHFR for selection of stable clones. Finally, the CHO cells can be transfected (as described above) with the SV40 driven vector. Labeling may be performed, as described above, to verify expression. The culture medium containing the expressed poly-His tagged PRO can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method, such as by Ni<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-chelate affinity chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4171&rsqb;</number> PRO may also be expressed in CHO and/or COS cells by a transient expression procedure or in CHO cells by another stable expression procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4172&rsqb;</number> Stable expression in CHO cells is performed using the following procedure. The proteins are expressed as an IgG construct (immunoadhesin), in which the coding sequences for the soluble forms (e.g. extracellular domains) of the respective proteins are fused to an IgG1 constant region sequence containing the hinge, CH2 and CH2 domains and/or is a poly-His tagged form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4173&rsqb;</number> Following PCR amplification, the respective DNAs are subcloned in a CHO expression vector using standard techniques as described in Ausubel et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols of Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, Unit 3.16, John Wiley and Sons (1997). CHO expression vectors are constructed to have compatible restriction sites 5&prime; and 3&prime; of the DNA of interest to allow the convenient shuttling of cDNA&apos;s. The vector used expression in CHO cells is as described in Lucas et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>24:9 (1774-1779 (1996), and uses the SV40 early promoter/enhancer to drive expression of the cDNA of interest and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR expression permits selection for stable maintenance of the plasmid following transfection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4174&rsqb;</number> Twelve micrograms of the desired plasmid DNA is introduced into approximately 10 million CHO cells using commercially available transfection reagents Superfect&reg; (Quiagen), Dosper&reg; or Fugene&reg; (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells are grown as described in Lucas et al., supra. Approximately 3 &times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7 </superscript></highlight>cells are frozen in an ampule for further growth and production as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4175&rsqb;</number> The ampules containing the plasmid DNA are thawed by placement into water bath and mixed by vortexing. The contents are pipetted into a centrifuge tube containing 10 mLs of media and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant is aspirated and the cells are resuspended in 10 mL of selective media (0.2 &mgr;m filtered PS20 with 5% 0.2,um diafiltered fetal bovine serum). The cells are then aliquoted into a 100 mL spinner containing 90 mL of selective media. After 1-2 days, the cells are transferred into a 250 mL spinner filled with 150 mL selective growth medium and incubated at 37&deg; C. After another 2-3 days, 250 mL, 500 mL and 2000 mL spinners are seeded with 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cells/mL. The cell media is exchanged with fresh media by centrifugation and resuspension in production medium. Although any suitable CHO media may be employed, a production medium described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,469, issued Jun. 16, 1992 may actually be used. A 3 L production spinner is seeded at 1.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/mL. On day 0, the cell number pH ie determined. On day 1, the spinner is sampled and sparging with filtered air is commenced. On day 2, the spinner is sampled, the temperature shifted to 33&deg; C., and 30 mL of 500 g/L glucose and 0.6 mL of 10% antifoam (e.g., 35% polydimethylsiloxane emulsion, Dow Corning 365 Medical Grade Emulsion) taken. Throughout the production, the pH is adjusted as necessary to keep it at around 7.2. After 10 days, or until the viability dropped below 70%, the cell culture is harvested by centrifugation and filtering through a 0.22 &mgr;m filter. The filtrate was either stored at 4&deg; C. or immediately loaded onto columns for purification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4176&rsqb;</number> For the poly-His tagged constructs, the proteins are purified using a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). Before purification, imidazole is added to the conditioned media to a concentration of 5 mM. The conditioned media is pumped onto a 6 ml Ni-NTA column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 4-5 ml/min. at 4&deg; C. After loading, the column is washed with additional equilibration buffer and the protein eluted with equilibration buffer containing 0.25 M imidazole. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into a storage buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, 0.14 M NaCl and 4% mannitol, pH 6.8, with a 25 ml G25 Superfine (Pharmacia) column and stored at &minus;80&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4177&rsqb;</number> Immunoadhesin (Fc-containing) constructs are purified from the conditioned media as follows. The conditioned medium is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated in 20 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After loading, the column is washed extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 100 mM citric acid, pH 3.5. The eluted protein is immediately neutralized by collecting 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 275 &mgr;L of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 9. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into storage buffer as described above for the poly-His tagged proteins. The homogeneity is assessed by SDS polyacrylamide gels and by N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4180&rsqb;</number> First, yeast expression vectors are constructed for intracellular production or secretion of PRO from the ADH2/GAPDH promoter. DNA encoding PRO and the promoter is inserted into suitable restriction enzyme sites in the selected plasmid to direct intracellular expression of PRO. For secretion, DNA encoding PRO can be cloned into the selected plasmid, together with DNA encoding the ADH2/GAPDH promoter, a native PRO signal peptide or other mammalian signal peptide, or, for example, a yeast alpha-factor or invertase secretory signal/leader sequence, and linker sequences (if needed) for expression of PRO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4181&rsqb;</number> Yeast cells, such as yeast strain AB110, can then be transformed with the expression plasmids described above and cultured in selected fermentation media.

<paragraph id="P-4184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4184&rsqb;</number> The following method describes recombinant expression of PRO in Baculovirus-infected insect cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4185&rsqb;</number> The sequence coding for PRO is fused upstream of an epitope tag contained within a baculovirus expression vector. Such epitope tags include poly-his tags and immunoglobulin tags (like Fc regions of IgG). A variety of plasmids may be employed, including plasmids derived from commercially available plasmids such as pVL1393 (Novagen). Briefly, the sequence encoding PRO or the desired portion of the coding sequence of PRO such as the sequence encoding the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein or the sequence encoding the mature protein if the protein is extracellular is amplified by PCR with primers complementary to the 5&prime; and 3&prime; regions. The 5&prime; primer may incorporate flanking (selected) restriction enzyme sites. The product is then digested with those selected restriction enzymes and subcloned into the expression vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4186&rsqb;</number> Recombinant baculovirus is generated by co-transfecting the above plasmid and BaculoGold&trade; virus DNA (Pharmingen) into <highlight><italic>Spodoptera fugiperda </italic></highlight>(&ldquo;Sf9&rdquo;) cells (ATCC CRL 1711) using lipofectin (commercially available from GIBCO-BRL). After 4-5 days of incubation at 28&deg; C., the released viruses are harvested and used for further amplifications. Viral infection and protein expression are performed as described by O&apos;Reilley et al., <highlight><italic>Baculovirus expression vectors: A Laboratory Manual</italic></highlight>, Oxford: Oxford University Press (1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4187&rsqb;</number> Expressed poly-his tagged PRO can then be purified, for example, by Ni<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-chelate affinity chromatography as follows. Extracts are prepared from recombinant virus-infected Sf9 cells as described by Rupert et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>362:175-179 (1993). Briefly, Sf9 cells are washed, resuspended in sonication buffer (25 mL Hepes, pH 7.9; 12.5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; 0.1 mM EDTA; 10% glycerol; 0.1% NP-40; 0.4 M KCl), and sonicated twice for 20 seconds on ice. The sonicates are cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant is diluted 50-fold in loading buffer (50 mM phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.8) and filtered through a 0.45 &mgr;m filter. A Ni<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-NTA agarose column (commercially available from Qiagen) is prepared with a bed volume of 5 mL, washed with 25 mL of water and equilibrated with 25 mL of loading buffer. The filtered cell extract is loaded onto the column at 0.5 mL per minute. The column is washed to baseline A<highlight><subscript>280 </subscript></highlight>with loading buffer, at which point fraction collection is started. Next, the column is washed with a secondary wash buffer (50 mM phosphate; 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 6.0), which elutes nonspecifically bound protein. After reaching A<highlight><subscript>280 </subscript></highlight>baseline again, the column is developed with a 0 to 500 mM Imidazole gradient in the secondary wash buffer.

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of Antibodies that Bind PRO </heading>
<paragraph id="P-4190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4190&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates preparation of monoclonal antibodies which can specifically bind PRO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4191&rsqb;</number> Techniques for producing the monoclonal antibodies are known in the art and are described, for instance, in Goding, supra. Immunogens that may be employed include purified PRO, fusion proteins containing PRO, and cells expressing recombinant PRO on the cell surface. Selection of the immunogen can be made by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4192&rsqb;</number> Mice, such as Balb/c, are immunized with the PRO immunogen emulsified in complete Freund&apos;s adjuvant and injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in an amount from 1-100 micrograms. Alternatively, the immunogen is emulsified in MPL-TDM adjuvant (Ribi Immunochemical Research, Hamilton, Mont.) and injected into the animal&apos;s hind foot pads. The immunized mice are then boosted 10 to 12 days later with additional immunogen emulsified in the selected adjuvant. Thereafter, for several weeks, the mice may also be boosted with additional immunization injections. Serum samples may be periodically obtained from the mice by retro-orbital bleeding for testing in ELISA assays to detect anti-PRO antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4193&rsqb;</number> After a suitable antibody titer has been detected, the animals &ldquo;positive&rdquo; for antibodies can be injected with a final intravenous injection of PRO. Three to four days later, the mice are sacrificed and the spleen cells are harvested. The spleen cells are then fused (using 35% polyethylene glycol) to a selected murine myeloma cell line such as P3X63AgU. 1, available from ATCC, No. CRL 1597. The fusions generate hybridoma cells which can then be plated in 96 well tissue culture plates containing HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) medium to inhibit proliferation of non-fused cells, myeloma hybrids, and spleen cell hybrids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4194&rsqb;</number> The hybridoma cells will be screened in an ELISA for reactivity against PRO. Determination of &ldquo;positive&rdquo; hybridoma cells secreting the desired monoclonal antibodies against PRO is within the skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4195&rsqb;</number> The positive hybridoma cells can be injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic Balb/c mice to produce ascites containing the anti-PRO monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in tissue culture flasks or roller bottles. Purification of the monoclonal antibodies produced in the ascites can be accomplished using ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by gel exclusion chromatography. Alternatively, affinity chromatography based upon binding of antibody to protein A or protein G can be employed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Purification of PRO Polypeptides Using Specific Antibodies </heading>
<paragraph id="P-4196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4196&rsqb;</number> Native or recombinant PRO polypeptides may be purified by a variety of standard techniques in the art of protein purification. For example, pro-PRO polypeptide, mature PRO polypeptide, or pre-PRO polypeptide is purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies specific for the PRO polypeptide of interest. In general, an immunoaffinity column is constructed by covalently coupling the anti-PRO polypeptide antibody to an activated chromatographic resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4197&rsqb;</number> Polyclonal immunoglobulins are prepared from immune sera either by precipitation with ammonium sulfate or by purification on immobilized Protein A (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, N.J.). Likewise, monoclonal antibodies are prepared from mouse ascites fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation or chromatography on immobilized Protein A. Partially purified immunoglobulin is covalently attached to a chromatographic resin such as CnBr-activated SEPHAROSE&trade; (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology). The antibody is coupled to the resin, the resin is blocked, and the derivative resin is washed according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4198&rsqb;</number> Such an immunoaffinity column is utilized in the purification of PRO polypeptide by preparing a fraction from cells containing PRO polypeptide in a soluble form. This preparation is derived by solubilization of the whole cell or of a subcellular fraction obtained via differential centrifugation by the addition of detergent or by other methods well known in the art. Alternatively, soluble PRO polypeptide containing a signal sequence may be secreted in useful quantity into the medium in which the cells are grown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4199&rsqb;</number> A soluble PRO polypeptide-containing preparation is passed over the immunoaffinity column, and the column is washed under conditions that allow the preferential absorbance of PRO polypeptide (e.g., high ionic strength buffers in the presence of detergent). Then, the column is eluted under conditions that disrupt antibody/PRO polypeptide binding (e.g., a low pH buffer such as approximately pH 2-3, or a high concentration of a chaotrope such as urea or thiocyanate ion), and PRO polypeptide is collected. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Drug Screening </heading>
<paragraph id="P-4200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4200&rsqb;</number> This invention is particularly useful for screening compounds by using PRO polypeptides or binding fragment thereof in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The PRO polypeptide or fragment employed in such a test may either be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant nucleic acids expressing the PRO polypeptide or fragment. Drugs are screened against such transformed cells in competitive binding assays. Such cells, either in viable or fixed form, can be used for standard binding assays. One may measure, for example, the formation of complexes between PRO polypeptide or a fragment and the agent being tested. Alternatively, one can examine the diminution in complex formation between the PRO polypeptide and its target cell or target receptors caused by the agent being tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4201&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides methods of screening for drugs or any other agents which can affect a PRO polypeptide-associated disease or disorder. These methods comprise contacting such an agent with an PRO polypeptide or fragment thereof and assaying (I) for the presence of a complex between the agent and the PRO polypeptide or fragment, or (ii) for the presence of a complex between the PRO polypeptide or fragment and the cell, by methods well known in the art. In such competitive binding assays, the PRO polypeptide or fragment is typically labeled. After suitable incubation, free PRO polypeptide or fragment is separated from that present in bound form, and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of the particular agent to bind to PRO polypeptide or to interfere with the PRO polypeptide/cell complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4202&rsqb;</number> Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to a polypeptide and is described in detail in WO 84/03564, published on Sep. 13, 1984. Briefly stated, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. As applied to a PRO polypeptide, the peptide test compounds are reacted with PRO polypeptide and washed. Bound PRO polypeptide is detected by methods well known in the art. Purified PRO polypeptide can also be coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. In addition, non-neutralizing antibodies can be used to capture the peptide and immobilize it on the solid support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4203&rsqb;</number> This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding PRO polypeptide specifically compete with a test compound for binding to PRO polypeptide or fragments thereof. In this manner, the antibodies can be used to detect the presence of any peptide which shares one or more antigenic determinants with PRO polypeptide. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Rational Drug Design </heading>
<paragraph id="P-4204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4204&rsqb;</number> The goal of rational drug design is to produce structural analogs of biologically active polypeptide of interest (i.e., a PRO polypeptide) or of small molecules with which they interact, e.g., agonists, antagonists, or inhibitors. Any of these examples can be used to fashion drugs which are more active or stable forms of the PRO polypeptide or which enhance or interfere with the function of the PRO polypeptide in vivo (cf., Hodgson, <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology, </italic></highlight>9: 19-21 (1991)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4205&rsqb;</number> In one approach, the three-dimensional structure of the PRO polypeptide, or of an PRO polypeptide-inhibitor complex, is determined by x-ray crystallography, by computer modeling or, most typically, by a combination of the two approaches. Both the shape and charges of the PRO polypeptide must be ascertained to elucidate the structure and to determine active site(s) of the molecule. Less often, useful information regarding the structure of the PRO polypeptide may be gained by modeling based on the structure of homologous proteins. In both cases, relevant structural information is used to design analogous PRO polypeptide-like molecules or to identify efficient inhibitors. Useful examples of rational drug design may include molecules which have improved activity or stability as shown by Braxton and Wells, <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>31:7796-7801 (1992) or which act as inhibitors, agonists, or antagonists of native peptides as shown by Athauda et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biochem., </italic></highlight>113:742-746 (1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4206&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to isolate a target-specific antibody, selected by functional assay, as described above, and then to solve its crystal structure. This approach, in principle, yields a pharmacore upon which subsequent drug design can be based. It is possible to bypass protein crystallography altogether by generating anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-ids) to a functional, pharmacologically active antibody. As a mirror image of a mirror image, the binding site of the anti-ids would be expected to be an analog of the original receptor. The anti-id could then be used to identify and isolate peptides from banks of chemically or biologically produced peptides. The isolated peptides would then act as the pharmacore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4207&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the present invention, sufficient amounts of the PRO polypeptide may be made available to perform such analytical studies as X-ray crystallography. In addition, knowledge of the PRO polypeptide amino acid sequence provided herein will provide guidance to those employing computer modeling techniques in place of or in addition to x-ray crystallography. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4211&rsqb;</number> This assay is designed to determine whether PRO polypeptides of the present invention show the ability to stimulate adrenal cortical capillary endothelial cell (ACE) growth. PRO polypeptides testing positive in this assay would be expected to be useful for the therapeutic treatment of conditions or disorders where angiogenesis would be beneficial including, for example, wound healing, and the like (as would agonists of these PRO polypeptides). Antagonists of the PRO polypeptides testing positive in this assay would be expected to be useful for the therapeutic treatment of cancerous tumors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4212&rsqb;</number> Bovine adrenal cortical capillary endothelial (ACE) cells (from primary culture, maximum of 12-14 passages) were plated in 96-well plates at 500 cells/well per 100 microliter. Assay media included low glucose DMEM, 10% calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 1&times; penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone. Control wells included the following: (1) no ACE cells added; (2) ACE cells alone; (3) ACE cells plus VEGF (5 ng/ml); and (4) ACE cells plus FGF (5 ng/ml). The control or test sample, (in 100 microliter volumes), was then added to the wells (at dilutions of 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%, respectively). The cell cultures were incubated for 6-7 days at 37&deg; C/5% C0<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. After the incubation, the media in the wells was aspirated, and the cells were washed 1&times; with PBS. An acid phosphatase reaction mixture (100 microliter; 0.&mgr;M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate) was then added to each well. After a 2 hour incubation at 37&deg; C., the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 microliters 1N NaOH. Optical density (OD) was measured on a microplate reader at 405 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4213&rsqb;</number> The activity of a PRO polypeptide was calculated as the fold increase in proliferation (as determined by the acid phosphatase activity, OD 405 nm) relative to (1) cell only background, and (2) relative to maximum stimulation by VEGF. VEGF (at 3-10 ng/ml) and FGF (at 1-5 ng/ml) were employed as an activity reference for maximum stimulation. Results of the assay were considered &ldquo;positive&rdquo; if the observed stimulation was &gt;50% increase over background.

<paragraph id="P-4215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4215&rsqb;</number> The ability of various PRO polypeptides to inhibit VEGF stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells was tested. Polypeptides testing positive in this assay are useful for inhibiting endothelial cell growth in mammals where such an effect would be beneficial, e.g., for inhibiting tumor growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4216&rsqb;</number> Specifically, bovine adrenal cortical capillary endothelial cells (ACE) (from primary culture, maximum of 12-14 passages) were plated in 96-well plates at 500 cells/well per 100 microliter. Assay media included low glucose DMEM, 10% calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 1&times; penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone. Control wells included the following: (1) no ACE cells added; (2) ACE cells alone; (3) ACE cells plus 5 ng/ml FGF; (4) ACE cells plus 3 ng/ml VEGF; (5) ACE cells plus 3 ng/ml VEGF plus 1 ng/ml TGF-beta; and (6) ACE cells plus 3 ng/ml VEGF plus 5 ng/ml LIF. The test samples, poly-his tagged PRO polypeptides (in 100 microliter volumes), were then added to the wells (at dilutions of 1%, 0. 1% and 0.01%, respectively). The cell cultures were incubated for 6-7 days at 37&deg; C./5% CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. After the incubation, the media in the wells was aspirated, and the cells were washed 1&times; with PBS. An acid phosphatase reaction mixture (100 microliter; 0.1M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate) was then added to each well. After a 2 hour incubation at 37&deg; C., the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 microliters 1N NaOH. Optical density (OD) was measured on a microplate reader at 405 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4217&rsqb;</number> The activity of PRO polypeptides was calculated as the percent inhibition of VEGF (3 ng/ml) stimulated proliferation (as determined by measuring acid phosphatase activity at OD 405 nm) relative to the cells without stimulation. TGF-beta was employed as an activity reference at 1 ng/ml, since TGF-beta blocks 70-90% of VEGF-stimulated ACE cell proliferation. The results are indicative of the utility of the PRO polypeptides in cancer therapy and specifically in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Numerical values (relative inhibition) are determined by calculating the percent inhibition of VEGF stimulated proliferation by the PRO polypeptides relative to cells without stimulation and then dividing that percentage into the percent inhibition obtained by TGF-&bgr; at 1 ng/ml which is known to block 70-90% of VEGF stimulated cell proliferation. The results are considered positive if the PRO polypeptide exhibits 30% or greater inhibition of VEGF stimulation of endothelial cell growth (relative inhibition 30% or greater). </paragraph>

PRO polypeptides testing positive in this assay would be expected to be useful for the therapeutic treatment of conditions or disorders where angiogenesis would be beneficial including, for example, wound healing, and the like (as would agonists of these PRO polypeptides). Antagonists of the PRO polypeptides testing positive in this assay would be expected to be useful for the therapeutic treatment of cancerous tumors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4238&rsqb;</number> Human venous umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Cell Systems) in growth media (50% Ham&apos;s F12 w/o GHT: low glucose, and 50% DMEM without glycine: with NaHCO3, 1% glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 10% FBS, 10 ng/ml bFGF) were plated on 96-well microtiter plates at a cell density of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>cells/well. The day after plating, the cells were starved by removing the growth media and treating the cells with 100 &mgr;l/well test samples and controls (positive control&equals;growth media; negative control&equals;Protein 32 buffer&equals;10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 4% (w/v) mannitol, pH 6.8). The cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37&deg; C., in 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The samples were removed, and the first part of the bDNA kit protocol (Chiron Diagnostics, cat. &num;6005-037) was followed, where each capitalized reagent/buffer listed below was available from the kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4239&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the amounts of the TM Lysis Buffer and Probes needed for the tests were calculated based on information provided by the manufacturer. The appropriate amounts of thawed Probes were added to the TM Lysis Buffer. The Capture Hybridization Buffer was warmed to room temperature. The bDNA strips were set up in the metal strip holders, and 100 &mgr;l of Captive Hybridization Buffer was added to each b-DNA well needed, followed by incubation for at least 30 minutes. The test plates with the cells were removed from the incubator, and the media was gently removed using the vacuum manifold. 100 &mgr;l of Lysis Hybridization Buffer with Probes were quickly pipetted into each well of the microtiter plates. The plates were then incubated at 55&deg; C. for 15 minutes. Upon removal from the incubator, the plates were placed on the vortex mixer with the microtiter adapter head and vortexed on the &num;2 setting for one minute. 80 &mgr;l of the lysate was removed and added to the bDNA wells containing the Capture Hybridization Buffer, and pipetted up and down to mix. The plates were incubated at 53&deg; C. for at least 16 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4240&rsqb;</number> On the next day, the second part of the bDNA kit protocol was followed. Specifically, the plates were removed from the incubator and placed on the bench to cool for 10 minutes. The volumes of additions needed were calculated based upon information provided by the manufacturer. An Amplifier Working Solution was prepared by making a 1:100 dilution of the Amplifier Concentrate (20 fm/&mgr;l) in AL Hybridization Buffer. The hybridization mixture was removed from the plates and washed twice with Wash A. 50 &mgr;l of Amplifier Working Solution was added to each well and the wells were incubated at 53&deg; C. for 30 minutes. The plates were then removed from the incubator and allowed to cool for 10 minutes. The Label Probe Working Solution was prepared by making a 1:100 dilution of Label Concentrate (40 pmoles/&mgr;l) in AL Hybridization Buffer. After the 10-minute cool-down period, the amplifier hybridization mixture was removed and the plates were washed twice with Wash A. 50 &mgr;l of Label Probe Working Solution was added to each well and the wells were incubated at 53&deg; C. for 15 minutes. After cooling for 10 minutes, the Substrate was warmed to room temperature. Upon addition of 3 &mgr;l of Substrate Enhancer to each ml of Substrate needed for the assay, the plates were allowed to cool for 10 minutes, the label hybridization mixture was removed, and the plates were washed twice with Wash A and three times with Wash D. 50 &mgr;l of the Substrate Solution with Enhancer was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37&deg; C. and RLU was read in an appropriate luminometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4241&rsqb;</number> The replicates were averaged and the coefficient of variation was determined. The measure of activity of the fold increase over the negative control (Protein 32/HEPES buffer described above) value was indicated by chemiluminescence units (RLU). The results are considered positive if the PRO polypeptide exhibits at least a two-fold value over the negative buffer control. Negative control&equals;1.00 RLU at 1.00% dilution.

The assay is performed as follows. On day one, mouse kidney mesangial cells are plated on a 96 well plate in growth media (3:1 mixture of Dulbecco&apos;s modified Eagle&apos;s medium and Ham&apos;s F12 medium, 95% fetal bovine serum, 5% supplemented with 14 mM HEPES) and grown overnight. On day 2, PRO polypeptides are diluted at 2 concentrations(l % and 0.1%) in serum-free medium and added to the cells. Control samples are serum-free medium alone. On day 4, 20 &mgr;l of the Cell Titer 96 Aqueous one solution reagent (Progema) was added to each well and the colormetric reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hours. The absorbance (OD) is then measured at 490 &mgr;m. A positive in the assay is anything that gives an absorbance reading which is at least 15% above the control reading. </paragraph>

PRO polypeptides are added to the growth medium at a concentration of 0.2% or 2% and the cells are incubated for 5 days at 37&deg; C. As a positive control, cells are treated with 100 &mgr;M hemin and as a negative control, the cells are untreated. After 5 days, cell lysates are prepared and analyzed for the expression of gamma globin (a fetal marker). A positive in the assay is a gamma globin level at least 2-fold above the negative control. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Induction of Pancreatic &bgr;-Cell Precursor Differentiation (Assay 89) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-4297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4297&rsqb;</number> This assay shows that certain polypeptides of the invention act to induce differentiation of pancreatic &bgr;-cell precursor cells into mature pancreatic &bgr;-cells and, therefore, are useful for treating various insulin deficient states in mammals, including diabetes mellitus. The assay is performed as follows. The assay uses a primary culture of mouse fetal pancreatic cells and the primary readout is an alteration in the expression of markers that represent either &bgr;-cell precursors or mature &bgr;-cells. Marker expression is measured by real time quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR); wherein the marker being evaluated is insulin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4298&rsqb;</number> The pancreata are dissected from E14 embryos (CDI mice). The pancreata are then digested with collagenase/dispase in F12/DMEM at 37&deg; C. for 40 to 60 minutes (collagenase/dispase, 1.37 mg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim, &num;1097113). The digestion is then neutralized with an equal volume of 5% BSA and the cells are washed once with RPMI1640. At day 1, the cells are seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates (pre-coated with laminin, 20 &mgr;g/ml in PBS, Boehringer Mannheim, &num;124317). Cells from pancreata from 1-2 embryos are distributed per well. The culture medium for this primary culture is 14F/1640. At day 2, the media is removed and the attached cells washed with RPMI/1640. Two mils of minimal media are added in addition to the protein to be tested. At day 4, the media is removed and RNA prepared from the cells and marker expression analyzed by real time quantitative RT-PCR. A protein is considered to be active in the assay if it increases the expression of the relevant &bgr;-cell marker as compared to untreated controls. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4322&rsqb;</number> This assay shows that certain polypeptides of the invention stimulate an immune response and induce inflammation by inducing mononuclear cell, eosinophil and PMN infiltration at the site of injection of the animal. Compounds which stimulate an immune response are useful therapeutically where stimulation of an immune response is beneficial. This skin vascular permeability assay is conducted as follows. Hairless guinea pigs weighing 350 grams or more are anesthetized with ketamine (75-80 mg/Kg) and 5 mg/Kg xylazine intramuscularly (IM). A sample of purified polypeptide of the invention or a conditioned media test sample is injected intradermally onto the backs of the test animals with 100 &mgr;l per injection site. It is possible to have about 10-30, preferably about 16-24, injection sites per animal. One &mgr;l of Evans blue dye (1% in physiologic buffered saline) is injected intracardially. Blemishes at the injection sites are then measured (mm diameter) at 1 hr and 6 hr post injection. Animals were sacrificed at 6 hrs after injection. Each skin injection site is biopsied and fixed in formalin. The skins are then prepared for histopathologic evaluation. Each site is evaluated for inflammatory cell infiltration into the skin. Sites with visible inflammatory cell inflammation are scored as positive. Inflammatory cells may be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, monocytic or lymphocytic. At least a minimal perivascular infiltrate at the injection site is scored as positive, no infiltrate at the site of injection is scored as negative. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Induction of Endothelial Cell Apoptosis (ELISA) (Assay 109) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-4324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4324&rsqb;</number> The ability of PRO polypeptides to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells was tested in human venous umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Cell Systems) using a 96-well format, in 0% serum media supplemented with 100 ng/ml VEGF, 0. 1% BSA, 1&times; penn/strep. A positive result in this assay indicates the usefulness of the polypeptide for therapeutically treating any of a variety of conditions associated with undesired endothelial cell growth including, for example, the inhibition of tumor growth. The 96-well plates used were manufactured by Falcon (No. 3072). Coating of 96 well plates were prepared by allowing gelatinization to occur for &gt;30 minutes with 100 &mgr;l of 0.2% gelatin in PBS solution. The gelatin mix was aspirated thoroughly before plating HUVEC cells at a final concentration of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml in 10% serum containing medium&mdash;100 &mgr;l volume per well. The cells were grown for 24 hours before adding test samples containing the PRO polypeptide of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4325&rsqb;</number> To all wells, 100 &mgr;l of 0% serum media (Cell Systems) complemented with 100 ng/ml VEGF, 0.1% BSA, 1&times; penn/strep was added. Test samples containing PRO polypeptides were added in triplicate at dilutions of 1%, 0.33% and 0.11%. Wells without cells were used as a blank and wells with cells only were used as a negative control. As a positive control, 1:3 serial dilutions of 50 &mgr;l of a 3&times; stock of staurosporine were used. The cells were incubated for 24 to 35 hours prior to ELISA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4326&rsqb;</number> ELISA was used to determine levels of apoptosis preparing solutions according to the Boehringer Manual &lsqb;Boehringer, Cell Death Detection ELISA plus, Cat No. 1 920 685&rsqb;. Sample preparations: 96 well plates were spun down at 1 krpm for 10 minutes (200 g); the supernatant was removed by fast inversion, placing the plate upside down on a paper towel to remove residual liquid. To each well, 200 &mgr;l of 1&times; Lysis buffer was added and incubation allowed at room temperature for 30 minutes without shaking. The plates were spun down for 10 minutes at 1 krpm, and 20 &mgr;l of the lysate (cytoplasmic fraction) was transferred into streptavidin coated MTP. 80 &mgr;l of immunoreagent mix was added to the 20 &mgr;l lystate in each well. The MTP was covered with adhesive foil and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours by placing it on an orbital shaker (200 rpm). After two hours, the supernatant was removed by suction and the wells rinsed three times with 250 &mgr;l of 1&times; incubation buffer per well (removed by suction). Substrate solution was added (100 &mgr;l) into each well and incubated on an orbital shaker at room temperature at 250 rpm until color development was sufficient for a photometric analysis (approx. after 10-20 minutes). A 96 well reader was used to read the plates at 405 nm, reference wavelength, 492 nm. The levels obtained for PIN 32 (control buffer) was set to 100%.

<paragraph id="P-4329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4329&rsqb;</number> Hairless guinea pigs weighing 350 grams or more were anesthetized with Ketamine (75-80 mg/kg) and 5 mg/kg Xylazine intramuscularly. Test samples containing the PRO polypeptide or a physiological buffer without the test polypeptide are injected into skin on the back of the test animals with 100 &mgr;l per injection site intradermally. There were approximately 16-24 injection sites per animal. One ml of Evans blue dye (1% in PBS) is then injected intracardially. Skin vascular permeability responses to the compounds (i.e., blemishes at the injection sites of injection) are visually scored by measuring the diameter (in mm) of blue-colored leaks from the site of injection at 1, 6 and 24 hours post administration of the test materials. The mm diameter of blueness at the site of injection is observed and recorded as well as the severity of the vascular leakage. Blemishes of at least 5 mm in diameter are considered positive for the assay when testing purified proteins, being indicative of the ability to induce vascular leakage or permeability. A response greater than 7 mm diameter is considered positive for conditioned media samples. Human VEGF at 0.1 &mgr;g/100 &mgr;l is used as a positive control, inducing a response of 4-8 mm diameter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4335&rsqb;</number> Cells from approximately 60 human tumor cell lines were harvested with trypsin/EDTA (Gibco), washed once, resuspended in IMEM and their viability was determined. The cell suspensions were added by pipet (100 &mgr;L volume) into separate 96-well microtiter plates. The cell density for the 6-day incubation was less than for the 2-day incubation to prevent overgrowth. Inoculates were allowed a preincubation period of 24 hours at 37&deg; C. for stabilization. Dilutions at twice the intended test concentration were added at time zero in 100 L aliquots to the microtiter plate wells (1:2 dilution). Test compounds were evaluated at five half-log dilutions (1000 to 100,000-fold).

<paragraph id="P-4338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4338&rsqb;</number> The results of these assays demonstrate that the positive testing PRO polypeptides are useful for inhibiting neoplastic growth in a number of different tumor cell types and may be used therapeutically therefor. Antibodies against these PRO polypeptides are useful for affinity purification of these useful polypeptides. Nucleic acids encoding these PRO polypeptides are useful for the recombinant preparation of these polypeptides. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4339&rsqb;</number> This example shows that certain PRO polypeptide-encoding genes are amplified in the genome of certain human lung, colon and/or breast cancers and/or cell lines. Amplification is associated with overexpression of the gene product, indicating that the polypeptides are useful targets for therapeutic intervention in certain cancers such as colon, lung, breast and other cancers and diagnostic determination of the presence of those cancers. Therapeutic agents may take the form of antagonists of the PRO polypeptide, for example, murine-human chimeric, humanized or human antibodies against a PRO polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4340&rsqb;</number> The starting material for the screen was genomic DNA isolated from a variety cancers. The DNA is quantitated precisely, e.g., fluorometrically. As a negative control, DNA was isolated from the cells of ten normal healthy individuals which was pooled and used as assay controls for the gene copy in healthy individuals (not shown). The 5&prime; nuclease assay (for example, TaqMan&trade;) and real-time quantitative PCR (for example, ABI Prizm 7700 Sequence Detection System&trade; (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, Calif.)), were used to find genes potentially amplified in certain cancers. The results were used to determine whether the DNA encoding the PRO polypeptide is over-represented in any of the primary lung or colon cancers or cancer cell lines or breast cancer cell lines that were screened. The primary lung cancers were obtained from individuals with tumors of the type and stage as indicated in Table 8. An explanation of the abbreviations used for the designation of the primary tumors listed in Table 8 and the primary tumors and cell lines referred to throughout this example are given below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4341&rsqb;</number> The results of the TaqMan&trade; are reported in delta (&Dgr;) Ct units. One unit corresponds to 1 PCR cycle or approximately a 2-fold amplification relative to normal, two units corresponds to 4-fold, 3 units to 8-fold amplification and so on. Quantitation was obtained using primers and a TaqMan&trade; fluorescent probe derived from the PRO polypeptide-encoding gene. Regions of the PRO polypeptide-encoding gene which are most likely to contain unique nucleic acid sequences and which are least likely to have spliced out introns are preferred for the primer and probe derivation, e.g., 3&prime;-untranslated regions. The sequences for the primers and probes (forward, reverse and probe) used for the PRO polypeptide gene amplification analysis were as follows:

<paragraph id="P-4342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4342&rsqb;</number> The 5&prime; nuclease assay reaction is a fluorescent PCR-based technique which makes use of the 5&prime; exonuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase enzyme to monitor amplification in real time. Two oligonucleotide primers (forward &lsqb;.f&rsqb; and reverse &lsqb;.r&rsqb;) are used to generate an amplicon typical of a PCR reaction. A third oligonucleotide, or probe (.p), is designed to detect nucleotide sequence located between the two PCR primers. The probe is non-extendible by Taq DNA polymerase enzyme, and is labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye and a quencher fluorescent dye. Any laser-induced emission from the reporter dye is quenched by the quenching dye when the two dyes are located close together as they are on the probe. During the amplification reaction, the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme cleaves the probe in a template-dependent manner. The resultant probe fragments disassociate in solution, and signal from the released reporter dye is free from the quenching effect of the second fluorophore. One molecule of reporter dye is liberated for each new molecule synthesized, and detection of the unquenched reporter dye provides the basis for quantitative interpretation of the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4343&rsqb;</number> The 5&prime; nuclease procedure is run on a real-time quantitative PCR device such as the ABI Prism 7700TM Sequence Detection. The system consists of a thermocycler, laser, charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and computer. The system amplifies samples in a 96-well format on a thermocycler. During amplification, laser-induced fluorescent signal is collected in real-time through fiber optics cables for all 96 wells, and detected at the CCD. The system includes software for running the instrument and for analyzing the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4344&rsqb;</number> 5&prime; Nuclease assay data are initially expressed as Ct, or the threshold cycle. This is defined as the cycle at which the reporter signal accumulates above the background level of fluorescence. The &Dgr;Ct values are used as quantitative measurement of the relative number of starting copies of a particular target sequence in a nucleic acid sample when comparing cancer DNA results to normal human DNA results. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4354&rsqb;</number> Human Blood Preparation and Lysis: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4355&rsqb;</number> Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers using standard infectious agent protocols and citrated into 10 ml samples per tip. Quiagen protease was freshly prepared by dilution into 6.25 ml cold ddH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml and stored at 4&deg; C. G2 buffer was prepared by diluting RNAse A to a final concentration of 200 &mgr;g/ml from 100 mg/ml stock. The blood (10 ml) was placed into a 50 ml conical tube and 10 ml C1 buffer and 30 ml ddH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (both previously equilibrated to 4&deg; C.) were added, and the components mixed by inverting and held on ice for 10 minutes. The nuclei were pelleted with a Beckman swinging bucket rotor at 2500 rpm, 4&deg; C. for 15 minutes and the supernatant discarded. With a vortex, the nuclei were suspended into 2 ml C1 buffer (4&deg; C.) and 6 ml ddH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>0 (4&deg; C.). Vortexing was repeated until the pellet was white. The nuclei were then suspended into the residual buffer using a 200 &mgr;l tip. G2 buffer (10 ml) were added to the suspended nuclei while gently vortexing, followed by vigorous vortexing for 30 seconds. Quiagen protease was added (200 &mgr;l) and incubated at 50&deg; C. for 60 minutes. The incubation and centrifugation was repeated until the lysates were clear (e.g., incubating additional 30-60 minutes, pelleting at 3000&times; g for 10 min., 4&deg; C.). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4357&rsqb;</number> (1) Isolation of Genomic DNA: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4358&rsqb;</number> Genomic DNA was equilibrated (1 sample per maxi tip preparation) with 10 ml QBT buffer. QF elution buffer was equilibrated at 50&deg; C. The samples were vortexed for 30 seconds, then loaded onto equilibrated tips and drained by gravity. The tips were washed with 2&times;15 ml QC buffer. The DNA was eluted into 30 ml silanized, autoclaved 30 ml Corex tubes with 15 ml QF buffer (50&deg; C.). Isopropanol (10.5 ml) was added to each sample, the tubes covered with parafin and mixed by repeated inversion until the DNA precipitated. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation in the SS-34 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&deg; C. The pellet location was marked, the supernatant discarded, and 10 ml 70% ethanol (4&deg; C.) was added. Samples were pelleted again by centrifugation on the SS-34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&deg; C. The pellet location was marked and the supernatant discarded. The tubes were then placed on their side in a drying rack and dried 10 minutes at 37&deg; C., taking care not to overdry the samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4359&rsqb;</number> After drying, the pellets were dissolved into 1.0 ml TE (pH 8.5) and placed at 50&deg; C. for 1-2 hours. Samples were held overnight at 4&deg; C. as dissolution continued. The DNA solution was then transferred to 1.5 ml tubes with a 26 gauge needle on a tuberculin syringe. The transfer was repeated 5&times; in order to shear the DNA. Samples were then placed at 50&deg; C. for 1-2 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4360&rsqb;</number> (2) Quantitation of Genomic DNA and Preparation for Gene Amplification Assay: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4361&rsqb;</number> The DNA levels in each tube were quantified by standard A<highlight><subscript>260</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>280 </subscript></highlight>spectrophotometry on a 1:20 dilution (5 &mgr;l DNA&plus;95 &mgr;l ddH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) using the 0.1 ml quartz cuvetts in the Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. A<highlight><subscript>260</subscript></highlight>/A<highlight><subscript>280 </subscript></highlight>ratios were in the range of 1.8-1.9. Each DNA samples was then diluted further to approximately 200 ng/ml in TE (pH 8.5). If the original material was highly concentrated (about 700 ng/&mgr;l), the material was placed at 50&deg; C. for several hours until resuspended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4362&rsqb;</number> Fluorometric DNA quantitation was then performed on the diluted material (20-600 ng/ml) using the manufacturer&apos;s guidelines as modified below. This was accomplished by allowing a Hoeffer DyNA Quant 200 fluorometer to warm-up for about 15 minutes. The Hoechst dye working solution (&num;H33258, 10 &mgr;l, prepared within 12 hours of use) was diluted into 100 ml 1&times; TNE buffer. A 2 ml cuvette was filled with the fluorometer solution, placed into the machine, and the machine was zeroed. pGEM 3Zf(&plus;) (2 &mgr;l, lot &num;360851026) was added to 2 ml of fluorometer solution and calibrated at 200 units. An additional 2 &mgr;l of pGEM 3Zf(&plus;) DNA was then tested and the reading confirmed at 400&plus;/&minus;10 units. Each sample was then read at least in triplicate. When 3 samples were found to be within 10% of each other, their average was taken and this value was used as the quantification value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4363&rsqb;</number> The fluorometricly determined concentration was then used to dilute each sample to 10 ng/&mgr;l in ddH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. This was done simultaneously on all template samples for a single TaqMan plate assay, and with enough material to run 500-1000 assays. The samples were tested in triplicate with Taqman&trade; primers and probe both B-actin and GAPDH on a single plate with normal human DNA and no-template controls. The diluted samples were used provided that the CT value of normal human DNA subtracted from test DNA was &plus;/&minus;1 Ct. The diluted, lot-qualified genomic DNA was stored in 1.0 ml aliquots at &minus;80&deg; C. Aliquots which were subsequently to be used in the gene amplification assay were stored at 4&deg; C. Each 1 ml aliquot is enough for 8-9 plates or 64 tests. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4368&rsqb;</number> Because amplification of the various DNAs described above occurs in various cancerous tumors and tumor cell lines derived from various human tissues, these molecules likely play a significant role in tumor formation and/or growth. As a result, amplification and/or enhanced expression of these molecules can serve as a diagnostic for detecting the presence of tumor in an individual and antagonists (e.g., antibodies) directed against the proteins encoded by the above described DNA molecules would be expected to have utility in cancer therapy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Identification of Receptor/Ligand Interactions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-4369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4369&rsqb;</number> In this assay, various PRO polypeptides are tested for ability to bind to a panel of potential receptor molecules for the purpose of identifying receptor/ligand interactions. The identification of a ligand for a known receptor, a receptor for a known ligand or a novel receptor/ligand pair is useful for a variety of indications including, for example, targeting bioactive molecules (linked to the ligand or receptor) to a cell known to express the receptor or ligand, use of the receptor or ligand as a reagent to detect the presence of the ligand or receptor in a composition suspected of containing the same, wherein the composition may comprise cells suspected of expressing the ligand or receptor, modulating the growth of or another biological or immunological activity of a cell known to express or respond to the receptor or ligand, modulating the immune response of cells or toward cells that express the receptor or ligand, allowing the preparaion of agonists, antagonists and/or antibodies directed against the receptor or ligand which will modulate the growth of or a biological or immunological activity of a cell expressing the receptor or ligand, and various other indications which will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4370&rsqb;</number> The assay is performed as follows. A PRO polypeptide of the present invention suspected of being a ligand for a receptor is expressed as a fusion protein containing the Fc domain of human IgG (an immunoadhesin). Receptor-ligand binding is detected by allowing interaction of the immunoadhesin polypeptide with cells (e.g. Cos cells) expressing candidate PRO polypeptide receptors and visualization of bound immunoadhesin with fluorescent reagents directed toward the Fc fusion domain and examination by microscope. Cells expressing candidate receptors are produced by transient transfection, in parallel, of defined subsets of a library of cDNA expression vectors encoding PRO polypeptides that may function as receptor molecules. Cells are then incubated for 1 hour in the presence of the PRO polypeptide immunoadhesin being tested for possible receptor binding. The cells are then washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde. The cells are then incubated with fluorescent conjugated antibody directed against the Fc portion of the PRO polypeptide immunoadhesin (e.g. FITC conjugated goat anti-human-Fc antibody). The cells are then washed again and examined by microscope. A positive interaction is judged by the presence of fluorescent labeling of cells transfected with cDNA encoding a particular PRO polypeptide receptor or pool of receptors and an absence of similar fluorescent labeling of similarly prepared cells that have been transfected with other cDNA or pools of cDNA. If a defined pool of cDNA expression vectors is judged to be positive for interaction with a PRO polypeptide immunoadhesin, the individual cDNA species that comprise the pool are tested individually (the pool is &ldquo;broken down&rdquo;) to determine the specific cDNA that encodes a receptor able to interact with the PRO polypeptide immunoadhesin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4371&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of this assay, an epitope-tagged potential ligand PRO polypeptide (e.g. 8 histidine &ldquo;His&rdquo; tag) is allowed to interact with a panel of potential receptor PRO polypeptide molecules that have been expressed as fusions with the Fc domain of human IgG (immunoadhesins). Following a 1 hour co-incubation with the epitope tagged PRO polypeptide, the candidate receptors are each immunoprecipitated with protein A beads and the beads are washed. Potential ligand interaction is determined by western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated complexes with antibody directed towards the epitope tag. An interaction is judged to occur if a band of the anticipated molecular weight of the epitope tagged protein is observed in the western blot analysis with a candidate receptor, but is not observed to occur with the other members of the panel of potential receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4372&rsqb;</number> Using these assays, the following receptor/ligand interactions have been herein identified: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4373" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;4373&rsqb;</number> (1) PRO943 binds to FHF1, PRO183 (FHF2), PRO184 (FHF3) and PRO185 (FHF4) and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4374" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;4374&rsqb;</number> (2) PRO331 binds to PRO1133 and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4375" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;4375&rsqb;</number> (3) PRO363 binds to PRO1387 and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4376" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;4376&rsqb;</number> (4) PRO5723 binds to PRO1387 and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4377" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;4377&rsqb;</number> (5) PRO1114 binds to PRO3301 and PRO9940 and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4378" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;4378&rsqb;</number> (6) PRO9828 appears to be a novel fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) ligand in that it binds to the known FGF receptors FGFR1, FGFR2IIIC, FGFR3IIIC and FGFR4. PRO9828 and agonists, therefore, will find use for activating the biological activities normally activated by FGF molecules including, for example, cell growth and proliferation. Antagonists of PRO9828 will find use in blocking the biological activities mediated through the FGF receptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4379" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;4379&rsqb;</number> (7) PRO1181 binds to PRO7170, PRO361 and PRO846. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4380&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotide probes were constructed from the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleotide sequences shown in the figures for use in quantitative PCR amplification reactions. The oligonucleotide probes were chosen so as to give an approximately 200-600 base pair amplified fragment from the 3&prime; end of its associated template in a standard PCR reaction. The oligonucleotide probes were employed in standard quantitative PCR amplification reactions with cDNA libraries isolated from different human adult and/or fetal tissue sources and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis so as to obtain a quantitative determination of the level of expression of the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acids in the various tissues tested. Knowledge of the expression pattern or the differential expression of the PRO polypeptide-encoding nucleic acids in various different human tissue types provides a diagnostic marker useful for tissue typing, with or without other tissue-specific markers, for determining the primary tissue source of a metastatic tumor, disease diagnosis, and the like. These assays provided the following results.

<paragraph id="P-4392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4392&rsqb;</number> A consensus DNA sequence was assembled relative to other nucleic sequences using phrap as described in Example 1 above. This consensus sequence is herein designated DNA139814. Based on the DNA139814 consensus sequence, oligonucleotides were synthesized: 1) to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest, and 2) for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full-length coding sequence for PRO9828. Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100-1000 bp in length. The probe sequences are typically 40-55 bp in length. In some cases, additional oligonucleotides are synthesized when the consensus sequence is greater than about 1-1.5 kbp. In order to screen several libraries for a full-length clone, DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification, as per Ausubel et al., <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, supra, with the PCR primer pair. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the gene of interest using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the primer pairs.

<paragraph id="P-4397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4397&rsqb;</number> DNA108722-2743 was identified by applying a proprietary signal sequence finding algorithm developed by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif.) upon ESTs as well as clustered and assembled EST fragments from public (e.g., Genbank) and/or private (LIFESEQ&reg;, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.) databases. The signal sequence algorithm computes a secretion signal score based on the character of the DNA nucleotides surrounding the first and optionally the second methionine codon(s) (ATG) at the 5&prime;-end of the sequence or sequence fragment under consideration. The nucleotides following the first ATG must code for at least 35 unambiguous amino acids without any stop codons. If the first ATG has the required amino acids, the second is not examined. If neither meets the requirement, the candidate sequence is not scored. In order to determine whether the EST sequence contains an authentic signal sequence, the DNA and corresponding amino acid sequences surrounding the ATG codon are scored using a set of seven sensors (evaluation parameters) known to be associated with secretion signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4398&rsqb;</number> Use of the above described signal sequence algorithm allowed identification of an EST cluster sequence from the LIFESEQ&reg; database, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, designated herein as CLU57836. This EST cluster sequence was then compared to a variety of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases which included public EST databases (e.g., Genbank) and a proprietary EST DNA database (LIFESEQ&reg;, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, Calif.) to identify existing homologies. The homology search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST2 (Altshul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>266:460-480 (1996)). Those comparisons resulting in a BLAST score of 70 (or in some cases 90) or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into a consensus DNA sequence with the program &ldquo;phrap&rdquo; (Phil Green, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash.). The consensus sequence obtained therefrom is herein designated DNA58756. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4399&rsqb;</number> In light of an observed sequence homology between the DNA58756 sequence and an EST sequence encompassed within clone no. 2251462 from the LIFESEQ&reg; database, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, Calif., clone no. 2251462 was purchased and the cDNA insert was obtained and sequenced. It was found herein that that cDNA insert encoded a full-length protein. The sequence of this cDNA insert is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 325</cross-reference> and is herein designated as DNA108722-2743. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4400&rsqb;</number> Clone DNA 108722-2743 contains a single open reading frame with an apparent translational initiation site at nucleotide positions 60-62 and ending at the stop codon at nucleotide positions 1506-1508 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 325</cross-reference>). The predicted polypeptide precursor is 482 amino acids long (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 326</cross-reference>). The full-length PRO7170 protein shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 326</cross-reference> has an estimated molecular weight of about 49,060 daltons and a pI of about 4.74. Analysis of the full-length PRO7170 sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 326</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:513) evidences the presence of a variety of important polypeptide domains as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 326</cross-reference>, wherein the locations given for those important polypeptide domains are approximate as described above. Clone DNA108722-2743 has been deposited with ATCC on Aug. 17, 1999 and is assigned ATCC Deposit No. 552-PTA. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-4411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4411&rsqb;</number> These deposit were made under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedure and the Regulations thereunder (Budapest Treaty). This assures maintenance of a viable culture of the deposit for 30 years from the date of deposit. The deposits will be made available by ATCC under the terms of the Budapest Treaty, and subject to an agreement between Genentech, Inc. and ATCC, which assures permanent and unrestricted availability of the progeny of the culture of the deposit to the public upon issuance of the pertinent U.S. patent or upon laying open to the public of any U.S. or foreign patent application, whichever comes first, and assures availability of the progeny to one determined by the U.S. Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to be entitled thereto according to 35 USC &sect;122 and the Commissioner&apos;s rules pursuant thereto (including 37 CFR &sect;1.14 with particular reference to 886 OG 638). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4412&rsqb;</number> The assignee of the present application has agreed that if a culture of the materials on deposit should die or be lost or destroyed when cultivated under suitable conditions, the materials will be promptly replaced on notification with another of the same. Availability of the deposited material is not to be construed as a license to practice the invention in contravention of the rights granted under the authority of any government in accordance with its patent laws. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-4413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;4413&rsqb;</number> The foregoing written specification is considered to be sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention. The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the construct deposited, since the deposited embodiment is intended as a single illustration of certain aspects of the invention and any constructs that are functionally equivalent are within the scope of this invention. The deposit of material herein does not constitute an admission that the written description herein contained is inadequate to enable the practice of any aspect of the invention, including the best mode thereof, nor is it to be construed as limiting the scope of the claims to the specific illustrations that it represents. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
