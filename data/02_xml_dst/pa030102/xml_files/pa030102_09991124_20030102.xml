<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to tampons, and more particularly to a tampon wetness detection system that signals the user that the tampon is approaching absorbent capacity and it is time to change the tampon. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Tampons are designed to contain a particular amount of menstrual fluid. The amount of menstrual fluid absorbed by a tampon can vary depending on absorbency levels. For example, in the United States, tampon absorbency can range from less than 6 grams (Junior absorbency) grams to 15-18 grams (Ultra absorbency). In order to ascertain whether a tampon has reached its absorbent capacity, the tampon must be removed and viewed, resulting in the destruction of the tampon, as most women are reluctant to reinsert the tampon. In most cases, a user will remove a tampon before it has reached its absorbent capacity in order to prevent an accident wherein the absorbent capacity of the tampon is exceeded. Once the absorbent capacity is exceeded, the excess menses flows unimpeded from the vagina to soil the user&apos;s clothing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A determinative criteria frequently used to gauge tampon replacement is the amount of time elapsed since insertion. The time elapsed criteria for changing tampons is not satisfactory for several reasons, e.g., the menstrual flow rate varies throughout the menstruating period and much adsorbent capacity of tampons is wasted due to the tendency to change before an accident occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The flow variation throughout the period causes problems as to how long to wear a tampon because a user cannot establish a definite time period for which the absorbent capacity within a tampon is sufficient. Therefore, she is in a quandary as to how long to wear specific tampons during days of heavy flow as contrasted to days of light flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A correlation between tampon performance during light flow versus heavy flow is difficult for the user to make. Thus, since the user would rather be safe than sorry, she frequently removes a tampon before the absorbent capacity of the tampon has been reached and wastes much of the product she had purchased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Tampons have been made larger and with different materials to obtain higher absorbencies, often resulting in product claims that a user would not have to change the tampon as often. But the user would still waste a portion of the tampon absorbent capacity, as most users are not willing to risk having an accident. Therefore, bigger tampons provide a longer wearing time but do not approach the problem of fully using the absorbent capacity within a tampon. In rare cases, should a user leave the tampon in for an extended period of time, a life threatening infection may develop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Wearing a high absorbency tampon can lead to discomfort and other problems as well. Women will sometimes wear a larger absorbency tampon due to the fear of tampon failure, especially if she is uncertain how often she will be able to access privacy in order to change the tampon. If the tampon is unsaturated, there may be drying of the vaginal wall, which may cause discomfort upon the tampon&apos;s removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a tampon wetness detection system that signals the user to change the tampon prior to soiling the user&apos;s clothing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As used herein the specification and the claims, the term &ldquo;resilience&rdquo; and variants thereof describes the capability of a strained body to recover its size and shape after deformation caused especially by bending, compressing, twisting, stretching or any combination thereof A resilient member can go from a relaxed configuration to a strained configuration to a relaxed configuration any number of times without losing substantially the ability to recover its original shape. A resilient member in a strained configuration possesses strain energy or potential energy of deformation. In the present invention, the release of the stored potential energy may cause the resilient member to revert to the relaxed configuration, resulting in a potential for kinetic movement&mdash;movement of portions of the resilient member within the catamenial device. The user may feel a discernible vaginal tactile sensation caused by this movement or motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As used herein the specification and the claims, the term &ldquo;weaken&rdquo; and variants thereof describe the loss of strength and/or integrity of a material, especially upon exposure to fluid or moisture. The material may loose its cohesive or adhesive nature, swell, dissolve or simply weaken such that it no longer can perform as in a dry state. Thus, the material no longer has the strength to restrain the resilient member in a strained configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In general, the absorbent article of this invention has at least two parts: a catamenial absorbent device and a wetness indicating structure. The wetness indicating structure may be a single unit or may have multiple components. The catamenial device may be a tampon and can also be either a tampon used with an applicator or one that is inserted digitally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, tampon <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (tampon configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>) has an absorbent core <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an upper portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and may optionally include string <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> covering absorbent core <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be a spring or any other shaped device that may go from a natural, relaxed configuration into a strained or compressed configuration and back to the relaxed configuration. The strained configuration of resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is maintained by restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is held and maintained in a compressed configuration by restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while the tampon is in a dry state. Upon penetration of fluid into the tampon, restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> weakens, which allows resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to assume its original, more relaxed configuration. This relaxation, which occurs as a quick release, produces a vibration or sensory movement that leads to a discernible sensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in top plan view. Resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has first arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, central portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, first surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. First surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are on opposing surfaces. At least one surface of an arm is roughened. For example, the first arm has a rough surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Additionally but not necessarily, second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may have a rough surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, too. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, both arms have rough surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which may be in the form of ridges, teeth, bumps, undulations, serrations or other surface irregularities (in a uniform or random pattern) that cause a vibration when rubbed against each other. First arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and central portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are aligned such that rough surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are in the same plane as indicated by dotted line &ldquo;AB&rdquo; (shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows two rough surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a single rough surface may be sufficient to cause vibrations or a scrapping sensation when rubbed or traversed across or against a smooth or smoother surface. In the following examples, it is understood that only one surface need have a rough surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As previously mentioned, the resilient member may be made from any resilient material capable of undergoing a deformation without loosing the ability to recover its original shape. A non-limiting list of these materials include elastomers and plastics such as polyacetals, polyolefins (e.g., polyethylenes and polypropylenes), nylons, rubbers, polyurethanes; and metals such as copper, stainless steel, spring steel, titanium, nickel, nitinol, and metals coated with any type of non-corrosive coating such as elastomers or plastics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be placed anywhere in the tampon but it is preferable that it be located near to lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of tampon <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. While not being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the vagina has a sensitive region surrounding the introitus and would be more receptive to the tactile movement of the wetness indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a plan view of resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an unstrained configuration. First arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has rough surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may have rough surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (ridges not visible but represented by dotted lines). First arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are connected to central portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. First arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> do not contact in the unstrained configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in a strained configuration. Second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> crosses over first arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that first surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contacts second surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at point of contact <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> holds resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the strained configuration. Upon use in a tampon, fluid eventually penetrates and begins to weaken restraining member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is sufficiently weakened, first surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> looses contact with second surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at point of contact <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As rough surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are in the same plane (shown dotted line AB in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), rough surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, upon the weakening of restraining member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, traverse or scrape against each other, producing a vibrating sensation that the user can detect. As previously mentioned, it is not necessary for both first surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to have rough surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The tie or restraint can be made from any soluble, water swellable material or any material that weakens or looses integrity upon exposure to fluid or moisture. These materials include but are not limited to gelatins, water soluble adhesives, cellulose derivatives including HPMC (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose) and ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyether urethane, polyethylene oxide, polyacrylamide and copolymers thereof, and polyacrylic acid. Materials that loose the ability to form cohesive bonds upon exposure to fluid may also be used. The restraint may be in the form of a ribbon, a band or a drop that sets and forms a bond, as in the case of an adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> show another embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the unstrained configuration is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> crosses over first arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that first surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contacts second surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at overlay <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the resilient member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in a strained configuration. Point of contact <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> between arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is maintained by restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Upon use, restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> weakens and resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> begins to revert into the relaxed configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. During this relaxation process, rough surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> scrapes or traverses against rough surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, causing a vibration or other detectable sensation. Again, as previously mentioned, it is not necessary for both first surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to have rough surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> held in a strained configuration by restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As shown, restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> holds resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> open such that first arm <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> do not cross over in the strained configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a cross section of tampon <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> containing resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a strained configuration. As shown, first arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are held apart by restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, first arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are positioned toward insertion end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of tampon <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, central portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned toward insertion end <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of tampon <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, tampon <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may include removal string <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Removal string <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be attached by any known means known in the art. In one embodiment, string <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is attached to lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of tampon <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, string <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is attached to central portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an unstrained configuration. Upon exposure to fluid, restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> softens and weakens to the point where the potential energy of the resilient member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> overcomes the force exerted by restraint <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to keep first arm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and second arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from crossing over. As the two arms traverse, rough surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> momentarily contact, causing a vibration or scraping sensation. This vibration or scraping is discernible to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Detection by the wearer of the wetness indicator is preferably subtle enough not to startle the user. It is preferred that the resilient member have a quick release or expansion from the strained state to the relaxed state in a fashion to be noticeable. A slow expansion may be less discernible to the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Absorbent tampons are usually substantially cylindrical masses of compressed absorbent material having a central axis and a radius that defines the outer circumferential surface of the tampon. Tampons are often formed by first obtaining a shaped mass of absorbent material called a tampon blank. This blank can be in the form of a roll of sheet-like material, a segment of a continuous absorbent material, a mass of randomly or substantially uniformly oriented absorbent material, an individually prepared or cast mass of absorbent material, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The tampon blank is relatively uncompressed and has a relatively low density. It may be compressed to form a product having overall dimensions less than those of the blank prior to use. The compressed tampons may have a generally uniform density throughout the tampon, or they may have regions of differing density as described in the commonly assigned applications to Friese et al., U.S. Ser. No. 07/596,454, and Leutwyler et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,102, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. Tampons also usually include a cover or some other surface treatment and a withdrawal string or other removal mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the wetness indicator of the present invention be contained within the central portion of the tampon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Another type of tampon that may contain a wetness indicating device may be the bag or sack-type tampon. In this type of tampon, absorbent material is contained within a overwrap that is at least partially fluid permeable. Examples of bag-type tampons are disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 09/741,718 (Buzot), U.S. Ser. No. 09/823,045 (Buzot) and U.S. Ser. No. 09/874,451 (Intravartolo et al.), the entire contents which are hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Absorbent material useful in tampon formation includes fiber, foam, superabsorbents, hydrogels, and the like. Preferred absorbent material for the present invention includes fiber and foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the fibers include hydrophilic fibers, and more preferably, the fibers include absorbent fibers, i.e., the individual fibers, themselves, absorb fluid. A useful, non-limiting list of useful tampon fibers includes natural fibers such as cotton, wood pulp, jute, and the like; and processed fibers such as regenerated cellulose, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, rayon, polyester, polyvinyl alcohol, polyolefin, polyamine, polyamide, polyacrylonitrile, and the like. Other fibers in addition to the above fibers may be included to add desirable characteristics to the absorbent body. For example, hydrophobic fibers may be used in outer surfaces of the tampon to reduce surface wetness and hydrophilic fibers may be used to increase the rate of fluid transport into and throughout the body. Preferably, the tampon fibers are rayon or cotton, and more preferably, the fibers are rayon. The fibers may have any useful cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferred fiber cross-sections include multi-limbed and non-limbed. More preferably, the fibers are predominantly multi-limbed. Multi-limbed, regenerated cellulosic fibers have been commercially available for a number of years. These fibers are known to possess increased specific absorbency over non-limbed fibers. One commercial example of these fibers are the Danufil VY multilimbed viscose rayon fibers available from Acordis Ltd., London, England. These fibers are described in detail in Wilkes et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,835, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the foams include hydrophilic foams, and more preferably, the foams may include absorbent foams, i.e., the foam cells, themselves, absorb fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A fluid-permeable cover may substantially enclose the tampon blank. Thus, the cover encloses a majority of the outer surface of the tampon. This may be achieved as disclosed in Friese, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,100, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. In addition, the cover may enclose either or both ends of the tampon. Of course, for processing or other reasons, some portions of the surface of the tampon may be free of the cover. For example, the insertion end of the tampon and a portion of the cylindrical surface adjacent this end may be exposed, without the cover to allow the tampon to more readily accept fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The cover can ease the insertion of the tampon into the body cavity and can reduce the possibility of fibers being separated from the tampon. Useful covers are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They may be selected from an outer layer of fibers which are fused together (such as by thermobonding), a nonwoven fabric, an apertured film, or the like. Preferably, the cover has a hydrophobic finish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The wetness indicating device can be inserted into the tampon blank prior to compression when the winding mandrel first rolls the nonwoven ribbon into an essentially cylindrical form. The wetness indicating device can also be inserted into the voids left when the winding mandrel is removed from the cylindrical form. Alternately, the wetness indicating device can be inserted after compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If other materials such as foam are used to make the tampon, the resilient member may be inserted through a slit cut into the lower portion of the tampon. Additionally, if the tampon has a cover, the resilient member can be placed between the cover and absorbent material, encircling the absorbent material. This may indent the tampon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Tampons are generally categorized in two classes: applicator tampons and digital tampons. Applicator tampons use a relatively rigid device to contain and protect the tampon prior to use. To insert the tampon into a body cavity, the applicator is partially inserted into the body cavity, and the tampon can be expelled therefrom. Because the rigid applicator device protects the tampon, the tampon need not have a high degree of dimensional stability. In contrast, digital tampons do not have an applicator to help guide them into the body cavity and require sufficient stability to allow insertion without using an applicator. </paragraph>
