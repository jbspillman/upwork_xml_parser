<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a gravel-or-the-like removing device which can discharge gravel, sand, mud or the like in a dredging site, a civil engineering work site, a sewage treatment plant, a sedimentation pool or a pit within a plant, an inside of a manhole or the like to a given place. In this specification, the term &ldquo;gravel-or-the-like&rdquo; means not only gravel but also sand, gravel, mud and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, as a gravel-or-the-like removing device which is served for the above-mentioned usage, there exists a suction pump <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> which has a constitution shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, for example. This suction pump <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is substantially comprised of an impeller casing <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> which accommodates an impeller <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> driven by a motor <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> in the inside thereof and includes a suction opening <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> at the center of a lower surface thereof, a perforated cylindrical strainer <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> which has an upper end thereof connected to a lower portion of an impeller casing <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and a lower end thereof opened downwardly, and an agitator <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> which is mounted on an agitator mounting shaft <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> which is connected to an output shaft of the motor <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To explain the gravel or the like removing operation using such a suction pump <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the impeller <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the agitator <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> are integrally rotated upon driving of the motor <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> so that gravel or the like is agitated by the agitator <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, the agitated gravel or the like is sucked into the inside of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> by the impeller <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and thereafter, the agitated gravel or the like is discharged to a desired location through a discharge pipe <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the normal operation, at the time of starting the suction pump <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, as a piled level of the gravel or the like S, a level D which is positioned below the cylindrical strainer <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is assumed. However, there may be a case that the operation of the suction pump <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is temporarily stopped. In this case, there is a possibility that the gravel-or-the-like piled level exceeds the level D, that is, the gravel-or-the-like piled level reaches a level E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In such a case, the gravel or the like is filled in the inside of the cylindrical strainer <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> through lateral holes formed in a peripheral wall of the cylindrical strainer <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, since water which gives fluidity to the gravel or the like is not supplied from the outside, the gravel-or-the like suction and discharge operation becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To solve such problems, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 306522/1979 proposes a gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which has a constitution shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As shown in the drawing, the gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is mounted on a bottom surface <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> of a pit A on which the gravel or the like is piled. A suction pump <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> which constitutes a body portion of the gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes an impeller casing <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> which forms a gravel-or-the-like suction opening at the center of a lower end thereof and makes a gravel-or-the-like discharge opening formed in a portion of a peripheral wall thereof communicably connected to a discharge pipe <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, an impeller <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> which is rotatably accommodated in the inside of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, and a watertight motor <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> which rotatably drives the impeller <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. A cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> which has a bottom plate <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> is connected to a bottom portion of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> in a coaxial manner. A large number of lateral holes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and vertical holes <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> are respectively formed in an entire peripheral wall <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> and the entire bottom plate <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> of the cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> having such a constitution is supported on a pump support base <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> which is formed of an annular frame. Further, an agitator <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured to an agitator mounting shaft <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> which is integrally connected to an output shaft of the watertight motor <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, a water suction pipe <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> which is vertically arranged in the inside of the pit A has a lower-end opening <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> thereof communicably connected to a portion of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> of the cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and an upper-end opening <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> thereof provided with a water suction auxiliary strainer <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. Here, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the lower-end opening <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> of the water suction pipe <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> is communicated with the cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> at a position below the gravel-or-the-like piled level B. On the other hand, the water suction auxiliary strainer <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is disposed far above the gravel-or-the-like piled level B and is positioned in the vicinity of a filled water level C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Due to such a constitution, even when the suction pump is embedded in the gravel or the like, at the time of starting the suction pipe, it becomes possible to supply water outside a gravel-or-the-like piled region which is disposed above the gravel-or-the-like piled level B into the suction pump through the suction pipe so that the gravel or the like can be diluted whereby the gravel or the like suction and discharge operation can be performed smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, the above-mentioned gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> has a following task to be solved in an actual operation. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> has a large number of lateral holes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> on the entire surface of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is completely embedded in the inside of the gravel or the like during a period in which the operation of the suction pump is stopped, a large volume of gravel or the like which is present along the outer periphery of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> is collapsed and enters the inside of the cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> through these lateral holes <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> so as to fill the inside space of the cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> with the gravel or the like. When the suction pump is started in such a state, although water is supplied to the inside of the cylindrical strainer portion <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> through the suction pipe <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, a quantity of the gravel or the like which the suction pump intends to suck becomes overwhelmingly large compared to a quantity of water supplied through the suction pipe <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the concentration of the gravel or the like is still excessively high so that the smooth suction and discharge operation becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made to solve such a problem and it is an object of the present invention to provide a gravel-or-the-like removing device which can surely and efficiently suck and discharge the gravel or the like even when the suction pump is embedded in the inside of the gravel or the like as in the case that the operation of the suction pump is temporarily stopped. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention to achieve the above-mentioned object, there is provided a gravel-or-the-like removing device which includes an impeller casing which accommodates an impeller driven by a motor in the inside thereof and has a suction opening at the center of the lower surface thereof, a peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like which is constituted of a cylindrical body which has an upper end thereof connected to a lower portion of the impeller casing and a lower end thereof opened downwardly and forms a water retention space in the inside thereof, and a water suction pipe which has an upper-end opening thereof opened in water above a gravel-or-the-like piled level and a lower-end opening thereof communicably connected with the water retention space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> By providing such a constitution to the gravel-or-the-like removing device, when the gravel-or-the-like piled level is elevated during the period in which the operation of the suction pump which constitutes an example of the gravel-or-the-like removing device is stopped, for example, and the impeller casing is embedded in the gravel or the like, the inflow of the gravel or the like into the inner space of the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of the gravel or the like can be surely prevented so that the water retention space which is filled with water can be ensured. On the other hand, the water suction pipe is communicably connected to this water retention space. Accordingly, when the suction pump is driven, since the fluidity of the water is higher than the fluidity of the gravel or the like which intrudes into the lower portion of the suction pump, a large quantity of water is supplied into the water retention space by suction so that the gravel or the like can be diluted with this water and is surely and effectively sucked and discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention is also characterized by following constitutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like has a whole area of a lower-end opening thereof opened. That is, so long as the collapse and inflow of the gravel or the like which may take through lateral holes formed on the peripheral wall can be prevented, even when the lower-end opening of the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of the gravel or the like is opened in its entirety, the inflow of the gravel or the like from below the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like can be suppressed as much as possible so that the sufficiently wide water retention space can be ensured in the inside of the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like. In this case, since a perforated bottom plate which constitutes a so-called resisting body is not present, by continuing the operation after starting the suction pump, the gravel or the like can be sucked and discharged more smoothly and efficiently while diluting the gravel or the like with water. On the other hand, depending on the property of the gravel or the like, a bottom plate may be mounted on the lower-end opening of the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like and a plurality of gravel-or-the-like inflow openings may be formed in this bottom plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like has no lateral holes on the entire peripheral surface thereof from a viewpoint of completely preventing the collapse and the suction of the gravel or the like which is present along the outer peripheral surface of the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like into the water retention space. On the other hand, depending of the property of the gravel or the like, to increase the mixing ratio of water into the gravel or the like, it may be possible to partially form lateral holes in the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like to an extent that the collapse and the inflow of the gravel or the like into the water retention space can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An output shaft of the motor is extended downwardly after passing through the suction opening of the impeller casing and the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like and an agitator is fixedly secured to an extended end of the output shaft. In this case, the agitator agitates the gravel or the like and mix the agitated gravel or the like and water so as to enhance the fluidity of the gravel or the like, and thereafter, the gravel or the like is sucked and discharged using the suction pump, whereby the suction and discharge effect can be further enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Further, it may be possible to mount a flat plate for preventing winding of string-like material to a lower surface of the impeller casing at the water retention space side or to mount a cylinder for preventing winding of string-like material on an outer peripheral surface of the agitator mounting shaft. In this case, even when the string-like material is mixed into the gravel or the like, it becomes possible to prevent the string-like material from being wound around a lower surface of the impeller casing and the agitator mounting shaft as much as possible so that the gravel or the like which contains the string-like material can be smoothly sucked and discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention to achieve the above-mentioned object, there is provided a gravel-or-the-like removing device which includes an impeller casing which accommodates an impeller driven by a motor in the inside thereof and has a suction opening at the center of the lower surface, a cylindrical strainer which has an upper end thereof connected to a lower portion of the impeller casing and a lower end thereof opened downwardly, and a peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like which is constituted of a cylindrical body arranged around the cylindrical strainer, makes an upper end of the cylindrical body connected to a lower portion of the impeller casing and a lower end thereof reach a position substantially equal to a lower end surface of the cylindrical strainer and forms a water retention space including the inside of the cylindrical strainer therein, and a water suction pipe which has an upper-end opening thereof opened in water above a gravel-or-the-like piled level and a lower-end opening thereof communicably connected to the water retention space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By providing such a constitution to the gravel-or-the-like removing device, in the same manner as the gravel-or-the-like removing device according to the first aspect of the present invention, the inflow of the gravel or the like into the inner space of the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like can be surely prevented so that the water retention space filled with water can be ensured. Accordingly, by diluting the gravel or the like with water supplied through the water suction pipe, the reliable and efficient suction and discharge can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, in an existing gravel-or-the-like removing device, by merely mounting a peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like around the cylindrical strainer (that is, without performing a large remodeling of the existing gravel-or-the-like removing device), the above-mentioned reliable and efficient suction and discharge of the gravel or the like can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Further, the second aspect of the present invention is characterized by providing following constitutions to the above-mentioned gravel-or-the-like removing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> That is, in the same manner as the first aspect of the invention, it is preferable that the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like has no holes over the entire peripheral surface thereof from the viewpoint of completely preventing the collapse and the suction of the gravel or the like present along the outer peripheral surface of the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like into the water retention space. On the other hand, depending on the property of the gravel or the like, to increase the water mixing ratio, the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like may be partially provided with holes on the condition that such holes do not generate the collapse and the inflow of the gravel or the like into the water retention space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Further, an output shaft of the motor is extended downwardly through the suction opening of the impeller casing and the cylindrical strainer and an agitator is fixedly secured to an extended end. In this case, since the gravel or the like can be sucked and discharged by the suction pump after enhancing the fluidity of the gravel or the like by agitating the gravel or the like by the agitator and mixing the agitated gravel or the like with water, the suction and discharge effect can be further enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The communicable communication of the lower-end opening of the water suction pipe to the water retention space is performed by communicably connecting the lower-end opening of the water suction pipe to the water suction opening formed in the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like. On the other hand, it may be possible to make the lower-end opening of the water suction pipe penetrate the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like and thereafter make the lower-end opening communicably connected with a water suction opening formed in the cylindrical strainer. In the latter case, since the lower-end opening of the water suction pipe can be directly communicably connected with the water retention space in the inside of the cylindrical strainer, even when the gravel or the like flows into the inside of the water retention space defined between the cylindrical strainer and the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like, so long as the water retention space is ensured in the inside of the cylindrical strainer, the suction and discharge of the gravel or the like can be performed surely and efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Further, a plurality of water suction pipes may be provided and the lower-end openings of one or more water suction pipes may be communicably connected with water suction openings formed in the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like and the lower-end openings of remaining one or more water suction pipes may be made to penetrate the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like and may be communicably connected with the water suction openings formed in the cylindrical strainer. In this case, since water can be supplied to both of the water retention space defined between the cylindrical strainer and the peripheral wall for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like and the water retention space defined in the inside of the cylindrical strainer, the gravel or the like can be diluted more efficiently so that the suction and discharge of the gravel or the like can be performed reliably and efficiently. Here, the cylindrical strainer may be formed of not only a perforated peripheral wall but also a non-perforated peripheral wall. In this case, effects for preventing the collapse and the inflow of the gravel or the like can be performed twice and the water retention space can be surely formed at least in the inside of the cylindrical strainer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention to achieve the above-mentioned object, there is provided a gravel-or-the-like removing device which includes an impeller casing which accommodates an impeller driven by a motor in the inside thereof and has a suction opening at the center of the lower surface, a cylindrical strainer which has an upper end thereof connected to a lower portion of the impeller casing and a lower end thereof opened downwardly, and a cover for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like which is constituted of a bowl-shaped body opened downwardly and arranged around the impeller casing and the strainer, makes an upper end of the bowl-shaped body connected to a motor casing which is mounted on the impeller casing and a lower end of the bowl-shaped body reach a position substantially equal to a lower end surface of the cylindrical strainer and forms a water retention space including the inside of the cylindrical strainer therein, and a water suction pipe which has an upper-end opening thereof opened in water above a gravel-or-the-like piled level and the lower-end opening thereof communicably connected to the water retention space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By providing such a constitution to the gravel-or-the-like removing device, in the same manner as the gravel-or-the-like removing devices according to the first and second aspects of the present invention, the inflow of the gravel or the like into the inner space of the cover for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like can be surely prevented so that the water retention space filled with water can be ensured. Accordingly, by diluting the gravel or the like with water supplied through the water suction pipe, the reliable and efficient suction and discharge of the gravel or the like can be realized. Further, according to this aspect of the present invention, since the cover for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like is configured to surround not only the cylindrical strainer but also the impeller casing, the wider water retention space can be formed at the lower portion of the gravel-or-the-like removing device, whereby the gravel or the like is diluted with water supplied through the water suction pipe thus enabling the more reliable and efficient suction and discharge of the gravel or the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The present invention is specifically explained hereinafter in conjunction with several embodiments shown in attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment is installed on a bottom surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a pit A on which gravel or the like (including mud) is piled. A suction pump <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which constitutes a body portion of the gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is provided with a gravel or the like suction opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the center of a lower end thereof and is provided with a gravel or the like discharge opening <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at a portion of a peripheral wall thereof which is communicably connected with a discharge pipe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, an impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is rotatably accommodated in the inside of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a watertight motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which rotatably drives the impeller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> To a lower portion of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an upper end of a cylindrical peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like which is capable of forming a water retention space <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the inside thereof and constitutes an essential part of the present invention is contiguously and coaxially connected. In this embodiment, an outer diameter of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like is made slightly smaller than an outer diameter of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As shown in the drawings, the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like is formed of a strip-like plate which has no holes over an entire peripheral surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereof for performing the gravel-or-the-like collapse and inflow prevention effect which will be explained later. Further, in this embodiment, a lower-end opening of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like is fully opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like is placed and supported on a pump supporting base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is formed of an annular frame. Further, an agitator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured to an agitator mounting shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is integrally connected to an output shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the watertight motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, in the inside of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like, a string winding prevention flat plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is mounted on a lower surface of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the water retention space side and a string winding prevention sleeve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is mounted on the agitator mounting shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Further, a lower-end opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of a water suction pipe <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which is vertically disposed in the inside of the pit A is communicably connected with a portion of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like, while a water suction auxiliary strainer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is mounted on an upper-end opening <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the water suction pipe <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Here, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the lower-end opening <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the suction pipe <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is communicably connected with the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like at a position below a gravel-or-the-like piled level B, while water suction auxiliary strainer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is positioned far above the gravel-or-the-like piled level B and in the vicinity of a stored water level C, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the gravel-or-the-like suction and discharge operation performed by the gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the above-mentioned constitution is explained in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Even when the suction pump <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is actuated by driving the watertight motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a negative pressure is generated in the inside of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, due to the provision of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like which has substantially no lateral holes, a phenomenon that a large quantity of gravel or the like present along the outer periphery of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like collapses and enters an inner space of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like can be surely prevented so that the water retention space <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> filled with water can be ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> That is, even when the gravel-or-the-like piled level B is elevated when the operation of the suction pump <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is stopped or ceased and eventually the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is embedded in the gravel or the like, the inflow of the gravel or the like into the inner space of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like can be surely prevented so that the water retention space <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> filled with water can be ensured. Since this water retention space <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is communicably connected with the water suction pipe <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, when the suction pump <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven, since the fluidity of water is higher than that of the gravel or the like which enters the lower portion of the suction pump <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a large quantity of water is supplied by suction and the gravel or the like can be surely and efficiently sucked and discharged by diluting the gravel or the like with this water flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Further, according to this embodiment, since the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like has the lower-end opening thereof fully opened, a perforated bottom plate which constitutes a so-called resistant body is not present. Accordingly, when the suction pump <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is started and the operation thereof is continued, the gravel or the like can be smoothly and efficiently sucked and discharged while being diluted with water. Depending on the property of the gravel or the like, it may be possible to mount a bottom plate in the lower-end opening of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like and to form a plurality of gravel or the like inflow holes in the bottom plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Further, in this embodiment, from the viewpoint of completely preventing the collapse and suction of the gravel or the like present along the outer peripheral surface of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like into the water retention space <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like has no holes over the entire peripheral surface thereof. On the other hand, depending on the property of the gravel or the like, to increase the water mixing ratio, the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like may be partially provided with holes on the condition that the collapse and the inflow of the gravel or the like into the water retention space <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are not generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Further, in this embodiment, the output shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the watertight motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is extended downwardly passing through the gravel or the like suction opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a central portion of the peripheral wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for preventing collapse and inflow of gravel or the like and an agitator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured to an extended end. Since the gravel or the like can be sucked and discharged by the suction pump <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> after agitating the gravel or the like with this agitator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the suction and discharge effect can be further enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Further, in this embodiment, since a string winding prevention flat plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is mounted on the lower surface of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the water retention space side and a string winding prevention sleeve <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is mounted on an outer peripheral surface of the agitator mounting shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, even when a string is mixed into the gravel or the like, it becomes possible to prevent the string from being entangled with the lower surface of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the agitator mounting shaft <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as much as possible whereby the gravel or the like containing the string can be smoothly sucked and discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to the second embodiment is installed on a bottom surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of a pit A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on which gravel or the like (including mud) is piled. A suction pump <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which constitutes a body portion of the gravel-or-the-like removing device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an impeller casing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is provided with a gravel or the like suction opening <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> at the center of a lower end thereof and is provided with a gravel or the like discharge opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at a portion of a peripheral wall thereof which is communicably connected with a discharge pipe <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, an impeller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which is rotatably accommodated in the inside of the impeller casing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and a watertight motor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which rotatably drives the impeller <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
