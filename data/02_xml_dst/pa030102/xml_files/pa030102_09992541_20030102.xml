<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention provides therapeutic and biological uses of chemokine-receptor-binding compounds (including chemokine receptor ligands such as chemokine receptor agonists or antagonists), such as benzopyrone derivatives, including uses in the treatment of disease states mediated by chemokines. The relevant chemokine may for example be interleukin-8 (IL-8), and the relevant chemokine receptors may for example be corresponding chemokine receptors (CXCR-1 and/or CXCR-2). In other aspects, the invention provides corresponding pharamaceutical compositions and therapeutic methods. In one aspect, for example, the invention provides for the use of &lsqb;7-&lsqb;benzopyrone-5&prime;(3&prime;-amino)-thiazole&rsqb;-phenylalanine-benyl ester in the treatment of disease. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Inflammatory reactions are generally characterized by dramatic movement of leukocytes and fluids from the bloodstream into the inflamed tissues. Chemotactic factors such as C5a, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and platelet-activating factor (PAF) are thought to mediate the migration of all types of leukocytes in inflammation. However, pathologically, it has been suggested that the types of infiltrating cell populations will vary depending largely upon the stimuli and the interval from the injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many different names have been applied to Interleukin-eight (IL-8), such as neutrophil attractant/activation protein-one (NAP-1), monocyte derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF), neutrophil activating factor (NAF) and T-cell lymphocyte chemotactic factor. IL-8 is understood to be a chemoattractant for neutrophils, basophils and a subset of T-cells. It is thought to be produced by a majority of nucleated cells including macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial and epithelial cells exposed to TNF, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta or LPS, and by neutrophils themselves when exposed to LPS or chemotactic factors such as FMLP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that belongs to a large family of chemoattractant molecules involved in the directed migration of immune cells. The physiological role generally assigned to chemokines in the immune process is to elicit mobilization of immune cells against pathogenic organisms by direct recruitment and activation. Based on their structural similarity, chemokines may be subdivided into four subfamilies, CXC, CC, C and CX<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>C, depending on the position of their first two cysteine residues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to IL-8, GRO-alpha, GRO-beta, GRO-gama and NAP-2 also belongs to the chemokine alpha-family. Like IL-8, these chemokines have also been referred to by different names. For instance, GRO-alpha, -beta, -gama have been referred to as MGSA-alpha, -beta, and -gama, respectively. Current understanding is that all of the chemokines of the alpha-family which possess the ELR motif directly preceding the CXC motif bind to the IL-8 beta receptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> IL-8, GRO-alpha, GRO-beta, GRO-gama and NAP-2 have been reported to promote the accumulation and activation of neutrophils, and these chemokines have accordingly been implicated in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> IL-8 has been found to stimulate a number of functions of human neutrophils, including induction of shape change, release of lysosomal enzymes, generation of superoxide, and increased expression of adhesion molecules on neutrophils. It has chemotactic activity not only for neutrophils but also basophils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> IL-8 is also thought to act on non-leukocytic cells such as melanoma cells and synovial fibroblasts in vitro. IL-8 reportedly enhances viral replication, particularly cytomegalovirus, in human fibroblasts in vitro. IL-8 may significantly inhibit the antiviral activities of interferon-gama. IL-8 may also increase the adhesion of unstimulated human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), enhance transendothelial migration and induce angiogenesis in rat cornea. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The production of IL-8 in various human diseases has been extensively studied. Clinically, IL-8 has been identified in skin lesions of psoriasis. IL-8 has also been detected in synovial fluids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a pathological role for IL-8 in the establishment of arthritis. Increased IL-8 levels have also been detected in other biological fluids such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF). These clinical observations have been taken to imply that detection of IL-8 in biofluids from patients may be an important indicator of the acute inflammatory diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Colonization of the gastric mucosa with <highlight><italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic></highlight>is reportedly associated with a dense infiltration of granulocytes into the lamina propria in the active phase of gastritis. In one study, antral biopsies from 27 patients with <highlight><italic>H. pylori</italic></highlight>-associated gastritis and 25 from <highlight><italic>H. pylori</italic></highlight>-negative individuals were analyzed for epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating protein 78 (ENA-78) and IL-8 mRNA by semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Only viable <highlight><italic>H. pylori </italic></highlight>yielded a strong ENA-78 and IL-8 induction, while <highlight><italic>H. pylori </italic></highlight>outer membrane proteins or water-soluble proteins had no significant effect. These findings may be taken as indicative of the importance of both IL-8 and ENA-78 in the development and perpetuation of <highlight><italic>H. pylori </italic></highlight>associated gastritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Two receptors for IL-8 are expressed on neutrophils: CXCR-1 (IL-8RA/R1) and CXCR-2 (IL-8RB/R2). These receptors share 77% amino acid sequence identity, and the respective genes are colocalized on chromosome 2q35. One receptor, CXCR-2, reportedly has high affinity for IL-8 and all other CXC chemokines that attract neutrophils (e.g. the GRO proteins, NAP-2, etc.), while the other, CXCR-1, reportedly has high affinity for IL-8 only. IL-8 receptors are also found on monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils, but the responses of these cells to IL-8 are much weaker than those of neutrophils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> IL-8 is thought to exert its biological activities by binding to the CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 receptors. Both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity but have different affinities for MGSA/Groalpha and NAP-2. It has been shown that the expression of epidermal CXCR-2 is increased in psoriasis, suggesting that activation of keratinocytes (KC) mediated by CXCR-2 contributes to the characteristic epidermal changes observed in psoriasis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The participation of inflammatory cells in atherosclerosis is a process that is thought to involve chemotactic cytokines, which may play a role in cellular entry into the vessel wall. Consistent with this, IL-8 and its receptor CXCR-2 are expressed on macrophages (Mphi) in atherosclerosis in mice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Xu, L and Fidler, I. J. studied the role of IL-8 in the progressive growth of ovarian cancer cells by isolating high- and low-IL-8-produced from the parental Hey-A8 human ovarian cancer cell lines. These studies have been taken to indicate that IL-8 has a direct and indirect growth-potentiating activity in human ovarian cancer cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> IL-8 (ELR<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) was the first CXC chemokine to be found to induce angiogenesis (Keane, M. P. and Strieter, R. M., The Role of CXC Chemokines in the Regulation of Angiogenesis. IL-8 was shown to mediate both in vitro endothelial cell chemotactic and proliferative activity, as well as in vivo angiogenesis in the absence of preceeding inflammation using bioassays of angiogenesis. IL-8 has been found to be significantly elevated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In Addition, IL-8 was determined to be a major angiogenic factor contributing to overall tumor-derived angiogenic activity in NSCLC and in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. </paragraph>

In some embodiments, cycloalkyls may have from 4-10 carbon atoms in their ring structure, such as 5, 6 or 7 carbon rings. Unless the number of carbons is otherwise specified, &ldquo;lower alkyl&rdquo; as used herein means an alkyl group, as defined above, having from one to ten carbon atoms in its backbone structure. Likewise, &ldquo;lower alkenyl&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower alkynyl&rdquo; have chain lengths of ten or less carbons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;alkyl&rdquo; (or &ldquo;lower alkyl&rdquo;) as used throughout the specification and claims is intended to include both &ldquo;unsubstituted alkyls&rdquo; and &ldquo;substituted alkyls&rdquo;, the latter of which refers to alkyl moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone. Such substituents can include, for example, halogen, hydroxyl, carbonyl (such as carboxyl, ketones (including alkylcarbonyl and arylcarbonyl groups), and esters (including alkyloxycarbonyl and aryloxycarbonyl groups)), thiocarbonyl, acyloxy, alkoxyl, phosphoryl, phosphonate, phosphinate, amino, acylamino, amido, amidine, imino, cyano, nitro, azido, sulfhydryl, alkylthio, sulfate, sulfonate, sulfamoyl, sulfonamido, heterocyclyl, aralkyl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety.

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Therapeutic Formulations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention provides a variety of therapeutic uses for amino-thiazole substituted benzopyrone derivative, such as Compound (1). In various embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be used therapeutically in formulations or medicaments for the treatment of CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 mediated diseases. The invention provides corresponding methods of medical treatment, in which a therapeutic dose of a compound of the invention is administered in a pharmacologically acceptable formulation. Accordingly, the invention also provides therapeutic compositions comprising compounds of the invention and a pharmacologically acceptable excipient or carrier. The therapeutic composition may be soluble in an aqueous solution at a physiologically acceptable pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions (medicaments) containing (comprising) compound of the invention. In one embodiment, such compositions include compound of the invention in an effective amount, meaning a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount, sufficient to modulate CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 activity, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In other embodiments, the compositions of the invention may include compound of the invention in a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount sufficient to modulate the activity of IL-8, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with other compositions and procedures for the treatment of diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;therapeutically effective amount&rdquo; refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result, such as modulation of CXCR-1, CXCR-2 or IL-8 activity. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of compounds of the invention to elicit a desired response in the individual. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of compounds of the invention are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;prophylactically effective amount&rdquo; refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as modulation of CXCR-1, CXCR-2 or IL-8 activity. A prophylactically effective amount can be determined as described above for the therapeutically effective amount. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In particular embodiments, a preferred range for therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of compounds of the invention may be 0.1 nM-0.1 M, 0.1 nM-0.05 M, 0.05 nM-15 &mgr;M or 0.01 nM-10 &mgr;M. Alternatively, total daily dose may range from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg, or up to 10 mg/kg or up to 1 mg/kg of patients body mass. Dosage values may vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgement of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the methods of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The amount of a compound of the invention in a therapeutic composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As used herein &ldquo;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&rdquo; or &ldquo;excipient&rdquo; includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. In one embodiment, the carrier is suitable for parenteral administration. Alternatively, the carrier can be suitable for intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, sublingual or oral administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. Moreover, compounds of the invention can be administered in a time release formulation, for example in a composition which includes a slow release polymer. The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and polylactic, polyglycolic copolymers (PLG). Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating compounds of the invention in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. In accordance with an alternative aspect of the invention, compounds of the invention may be formulated with one or more additional compounds that enhance the solubility of compounds of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts that are well known to those skilled in the art such as basic salts of inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, methane sulphonic acid, ethane sulphonic acid, acetic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, benzoic acid, alicylic acid, phenylacetic acid and mandelic acid. In alternative embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable cation salts may include alkaline, alkaline earth, ammonium and quaternary ammonium cations. </paragraph>
