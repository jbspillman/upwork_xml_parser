<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention provides a planar waveguide diffractive 1&times;N beam splitter/coupler. It utilizes an integrated circuit fabrication process to fabricate an integrated optic. A Fourier transform diffractive optical element (DOE) is formed on one end of a planar waveguide (planar lightwave circuit; PLC). Thus, an incident beam coming from one end of the planar waveguide can be diffracted into a plurality of output beams. On the other hand, a plurality of incident beams coming from one end of the planar waveguide can be coupled into one output beam. The beam splitter/coupler is easy to fabricate, small in size and more flexible for applications. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to an optical beam splitter/coupler, and more particularly relates to a planar waveguide diffraction 1&times;N beam splitter/coupler fabricated by an integrated circuit manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In recent years, the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) method has been widely used in fiber optic communication systems. 30 or more channels carrying light beams of different wavelengths are used to transfer data so as to increase the information carrying capacity. To fulfill the demand of increasing transference capacity, a structure of dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) is being developed to increase the density of the transmission channel and create a high capacity, wide band fiber optic communication system. In a DWDM system, a plurality of information carrying light beams of different wavelengths are combined (coupled or multiplexed) onto a single fiber to increase its information carrying capacity through the optical fiber. At the receiving end, the beams are spatially separated (split or demultiplexed) and each beam is received by a separate detector for recovery of the information that it carries. Current common techniques for beam splitting coupling are fused fiber and ribbed waveguide. The fused fiber is easy to fabricate but inadequate for beam splitting because it has fewer channels, bulky dimensions and unsatisfactory component integration. On the contrary, the waveguide coupler has better beam splitting, more channels, less dimensions and better component integration, but is relatively difficult to fabricate and is less flexible in assembly applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The previous beam splitters and couplers have the disadvantages of higher energy loss and higher fabrication cost. Especially when fabricating a 1&times;N/N&times;1 beam splitter/coupler, it requires a plurality of 1&times;2/2&times;1 beam splitters/beam couplers linking serially, which loses a great deal of transmission energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,953,935 by Suchoski, Jr., et al. entitled &ldquo;Integrated Optic Star Coupler&rdquo; and issued Sep. 4, 1990 discloses an optical coupler including a planar substrate for receiving a circuit array of one or more surfaces for splitters disposed thereon by a two step proton exchange (TSPE) process. Although the optical coupler is fabricated through a semiconductor process, it still has the disadvantages of higher waveguide loss and coupling loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,274,706 by Tangonan, et al. entitled &ldquo;Wavelength Multiplexer/demultiplexer for Optical Circuits&rdquo; and issued Jun. 23, 1981 discloses a wavelength selective coupler that comprises a planar optical waveguide formed within a glass substrate having an input/output surface at one end and a curved surface at the other end upon which is mounted a reflective diffraction grating. The periodic diffraction grating acts as a demultiplexer. The grating is a separate unit adhered to the curved surface that is formed on one end of the waveguide. The input/output surface formed at the other end of the waveguide is a polished flat surface. The fabrication processes for the curved surface and the flat surface and adhering of the grating are rather complicated and difficult. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is therefore to provide a beam splitter/coupler, which is easy to fabricate, small in size and more flexible for applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To achieve the aforesaid object, a beam splitter/coupler according to the invention utilizes a Fourier transform diffractive optical element (DOE). The surface of the diffractive optical element is designed to diffract an incident beam into several (N&equals;number of) beams with the same intensity. The invention further applies fabrication techniques of the planar waveguide to form a Fourier transform diffractive optical element on one end of the planar waveguide. For example, a micro-etching process for the mask of the integrate circuit can be applied for fabricating a beam splitter/coupler with a Fourier transform diffractive optical element formed on a planar waveguide. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> beam splitter/coupler with a planar waveguide according to the invention includes a planar waveguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> composed of three optical material layers M1, M2 and M3, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The refractive indexes of the layers M1, M2 and M3 are n1, n2, and n3 respectively, in which n2&gt;n1 and n2&gt;n3 so as to make light beams coming into layer M2 totally refracted and transmitted therein. A Fourier transform diffraction element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, fabricated by an integrated circuit process, is directly formed on one end of the planar waveguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an incident beam coming from one end of the planar waveguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is diffracted into several (N) beams, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. On the other hand, several (N) beams coming from one end of the planar waveguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be coupled into one beam, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The shape of the Fourier transform diffraction element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is defined by a contour formed on one end of the planar waveguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The design process is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. First, in step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, determine the number, position and intensity of a plurality of beams to be split on a target image plane as a function of g(x,y). Then, use an inverse Fourier transform (IFT) to obtain a wave-front function, G(&ngr;,&eegr;) at frequency plan and use a Fourier transform (FT) to calculate this wave-front function (steps <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), and repeat step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to obtain a optimization wave-front function. Finally, use the final wave-front function to illustrate the shape of the Fourier transform diffraction element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> After determining the shape of the Fourier transform diffraction element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a mask <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a contour as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will be made. One end of the mask <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a contour corresponding to the shape of the Fourier transform diffraction element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be fabricated. Then, use a micro-etching technique of the integrated circuit fabrication process to form the Fourier transform diffraction element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on one end of the planar waveguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The output ports, called optical fiber connecting ends <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and the input end of the incident beam are all located on the opposite end of the Fourier transform diffraction element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>.
