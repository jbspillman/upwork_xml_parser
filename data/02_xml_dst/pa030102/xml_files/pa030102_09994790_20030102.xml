<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and device for shaping the waveform of an optical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The modulation rate of a signal used in optical fiber communication continues to increase year after year. At present, a high-speed system having a modulation rate of 2.5 Gb/s or 10 Gb/s per channel is in actual use. Further, optical transmission employing a modulation rate of 40 Gb/s per channel is being examined in a system under investigation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various formats such as NRZ and RZ formats are used for an optical signal to increase a modulation rate. Further, an optical amplifier for compensating for loss of an optical signal to increase a transmission distance is in actual use. For example, a rare earth doped optical amplifier characterized in direct amplification, typically such as an erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), is in actual use. A repeater employing such an optical amplifier is used to compensate for a reduction in power of an optical signal due to transmission loss by an optical fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The optical amplifier is an analog amplifier, and it can therefore amplify an optical signal in an arbitrary format. However, in amplifying an optical signal, the optical amplifier always adds amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) to the optical signal, so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SN ratio) of the optical signal is reduced by the amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the SN ratio decreases with an increase in the number of repeaters, causing a limit to a transmission distance. The nonlinear optical-effects and group velocity dispersion in an optical fiber increase the ASE to degrade the waveform of an optical signal, causing a transmission limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To break down such a transmission limit, regenerative repeating is required before bit error becomes excessive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is estimated that wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) will be extensively applied to a future photonic network. Accordingly, it is expected that different modulation rates of 2.5 Gb/s, 10 Gb/s, and 40 Gb/s, for example, will be mixed for optical signals in WDM channels. Further, the formats of optical signals in WDM channels are considered to be different from each other. Accordingly, such a network is required to employ a regenerative repeater capable of performing a transparent operation independent of the modulation rates and formats of optical signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a regenerative repeater using an electrical circuit, there is a limit such as an electrical band limit, and it is therefore difficult to realize such a transparent operation. In an all-optical regenerative repeater capable of performing all kinds of signal processing in optical level, the above-mentioned limit is almost eliminated to allow a transparent operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The functions required for the all-optical regenerative repeater are amplitude restoration or reamplification, waveform shaping or reshaping, and timing restoration or retiming. These functions are referred to as <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>R functions, and in particular, the first and second functions are referred to as <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>R functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> waveform shaping device used most generally in the prior art requires electrical signal processing. First, input signal light is converted into an electrical signal by an O/E converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This electrical signal is next input into an electrical <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>R regenerator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to shape the waveform of the electrical signal. Thereafter, the waveform-shaped electrical signal is converted into an optical signal by an E/O converter <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> using a laser diode (LD) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In this waveform shaping method employing electrical signal processing, the modulation rate of the signal light that can be processed is limited by electrical band limitation. As a result, it is difficult to regenerate the waveform of a high-speed optical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a conventional waveform shaping device designed to optically perform all kinds of signal processing. Signal light controlled in its polarization state by a polarization controller (PC) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and probe light from a laser diode (LD) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a probe light source are supplied to an optical gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the optical gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, waveform shaped light is obtained by an optical gate operation. Thereafter, the waveform shaped light output from the optical gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is extracted by an optical bandpass filter (BPF) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and output from this device. In this case, the wavelength of the waveform shaped light is equal to the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>of the probe light. Further, the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>of the probe light is set different from the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>of the signal light from a necessity viewpoint of extraction of the waveform shaped light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Examples of the optical gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include a nonlinear optical loop mirror, a nonlinear switch having a Michelson or Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration, and a switch employing a saturable absorber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The prior art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> has a problem that polarization dependence occurs in obtaining a sufficient waveform shaping function. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the polarization controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is required to adjust or control the polarization state of the signal light to be input into the optical gate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, causing complexity of the device configuration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Some preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a first preferred embodiment of the device according to the present invention. This device includes a first optical gate (OG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second optical gate (OG<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> cascaded to each other. These optical gates <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are optically connected by an optical bandpass filter (BPF) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Further, a laser diode (LD) <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as a probe light source is optically connected to the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The probe light source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> outputs probe light having a wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>out</subscript></highlight>. The probe light and signal light having a wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>are input into the optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that the probe light and the signal light propagate in an optical medium (e.g., nonlinear optical medium) of the optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the same direction. The optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is of a polarization independent type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Of an output from the optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, light having the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>is passed through the optical bandpass filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and next input into the optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Then, this light is passed through the optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to obtain waveform shaped light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In this preferred embodiment, the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>of the probe light is set different from the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>of the signal light, so as to separate the waveform shaped light from the signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having no polarization dependence, an electroabsorption optical modulator may be used, for example. When a bulk type electroabsorption optical modulator is used, a polarization independent transmission characteristic can be obtained. By using a polarization independent gate as the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a polarization independent operation can be provided as a whole irrespective of whether or not the second optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has polarization dependence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the case that a reverse bias is being applied to an electroabsorption optical modulator, cross absorption modulation (XAM) is generated by light-injection from the outside. By this XAM, a high level and a low level of signal light as a binary code are converted into a high level and a low level of output light (wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>out</subscript></highlight>), respectively. At this time, absorption saturation is generated by screening and band filling of an external electrical field by an optically pumped carrier, so that the output nonlinearly changes with input optical power from the outside. This principle is described in detail in &ldquo;IEE Electron. Lett. Vol. 25, No. 2, pp. 88-89&rdquo;, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> By setting the power level of the input signal light to an optimum value, amplitude noise of the space level in the converted signal light (wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>out</subscript></highlight>) can be suppressed by the above nonlinear characteristic. When the reverse bias is increased, the nonlinear transmission characteristic can be made steeper to the external input optical power. By utilizing this effect, the amplitude noise can be further compressed. However, insertion loss by the modulator increases with an increase in the reverse bias. Accordingly, it is preferable to set an optimum value of the reverse bias so that a required characteristic can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the polarization independent optical gate configured by such an electroabsorption optical modulator, the optically pumped carrier is withdrawn by the reverse bias, so that XAM responds at a high speed, and signal light pattern dependence can be suppressed. Accordingly, an optical gate operation independent of a transmission speed of signal light can be performed. For example, a high-speed operation at 40 Gb/s has been reported in &ldquo;IEICE Trans. Electron., vol. E81-C, pp. 1251-1257, 1998&rdquo;. Further, since this optical gate is an optical gate based on XAM by an optical signal, the operation can be performed for signal light in an arbitrary format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the signal light and the probe light propagate in the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the same direction. Accordingly, the optical bandpass filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is used to separate the resultant converted light from the signal light. To allow this separation, the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>of the probe light is set different from the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>of the signal light. As a result, not only waveform shaping, but also wavelength conversion can be made according to this preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The converted light passed through the optical bandpass filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is supplied to the second optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a function of suppressing amplitude noise of the mark level. In the case that the optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has polarization dependence, the polarization state of the probe light may be preliminarily set so that the operation of the optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> becomes effective to the maximum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As the second optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a gain-clamped amplifier using a DFB-LD may be used. The gain-clamped amplifier functions as a limiter amplifier. By optimizing input power, for example, amplitude noise of the mark level can be effectively suppressed. The principle of operation of the limiter amplifier is described in Watanabe, &ldquo;Method, device and system for waveform shaping of signal light&rdquo;, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-323786, for example. While the limiter amplifier has polarization dependence, an operation independent of polarization of the signal light can be performed by optimizing the polarization state of the probe light as mentioned above. Further, in a gain-clamped condition the limiter amplifier responds at a high speed of tens of picoseconds to a change in light intensity of the laser, so that the limiter amplifier can operate to an ultrahigh-speed signal of 40 Gb/s or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Usually, a reverse bias of &minus;2 to &minus;3 V is applied to the electroabsorption optical modulator used as the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows an output characteristic Pout of the probe light to input signal light power P<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>. When the input power P<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is smaller, the slope of the output power P<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>is smaller, and when the input power P<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>is larger, the slope of the output power P<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>is larger as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Accordingly, by utilizing this characteristic to optimize the power of the signal light, amplitude noise of the space level can be suppressed. Usually, a power of about 10 dBm is required for utilization of XAM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a graph showing an output characteristic of the gain-clamped amplifier usable as the second optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as similar to the graph shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Usually, assist light is additionally input into the gain-clamped amplifier, thereby stabilizing the operation. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the output power P<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>substantially linearly increases with an increase in the input power P<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>up to a certain value, and when the input power P<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>, becomes greater than the certain value, the output power P<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>is substantially constant. Accordingly, by optimizing the power of the signal light, amplitude noise of the mark level can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows an output characteristic obtained by combining the characteristic shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A and the characteristic shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. That is, the characteristic shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> is a characteristic of the whole device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. According to this preferred embodiment, the optical gates <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> having required characteristics are cascaded, so that amplitude noise of both the space level and the mark level can be suppressed by using the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is shown a second preferred embodiment of the device according to the present invention. In contrast to the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the second preferred embodiment is characterized in that optical paths are set so that the probe light and the signal light propagate in the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in opposite directions. That is, an optical coupler <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided between the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the second optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in place of the optical bandpass filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The signal light is input through the optical coupler <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the second optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> side, and the probe light from the probe light source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is input into the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As the optical coupler <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a semitransparent mirror, 3-dB coupler, optical circulator, or the like may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to this preferred embodiment, amplitude noise of both the mark level and the space level can be suppressed as in the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the optical bandpass filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this preferred embodiment, an antireflection coating or oblique polishing is preferably applied to the end surface of the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so as to sufficiently suppress the reflection of the signal light incident on the end surface of the first optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. With this configuration, crosstalk due to the incidence of the reflected signal light on the second optical gate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be effectively prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> While the optical bandpass filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an independent member, a filter film such as a dielectric multilayer film may be formed on the output end surface of the optical gate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thereby obtaining a similar function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the optical bandpass filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is not required. Accordingly, the relation between the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>, of the signal light and the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>of the probe light is arbitrary. That is, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>and &lgr;<highlight><subscript>out </subscript></highlight>may be set equal to each other. Thus, waveform shaping not accompanied by wavelength conversion can be performed. In contrast, such waveform shaping is impossible in the preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a third preferred embodiment of the device (system) according to the present invention. In this preferred embodiment, the present invention is applied to wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). Accordingly, the signal light input into the system is WDM signal light obtained by wavelength division multiplexing a plurality of optical signals having different wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>(n is an integer greater than 1). An optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used to divide the input WDM signal light into the plural optical signals respectively having the wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to &lgr;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. These optical signals output from the optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are supplied to a plurality of devices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>(&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>(&num;n) according to the present invention, respectively. In the devices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>(&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>(&num;n), the respective optical signals undergo waveform shaping. Thereafter, the optical signals output from the devices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>(&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>(&num;n) are supplied to an optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to obtain WDM signal light, and the resultant WDM signal light is output from the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As each of the optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, an arrayed waveguide grating may be used, for example. In this case, the optical demultiplexer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the optical multiplexer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the devices <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>(&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>(&num;n) according to the present invention can be easily integrated on a substrate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> formed of S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or the like. Accordingly, the waveform shaping system applicable to WDM can be made greatly compact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a fourth preferred embodiment of the device (system) according to the present invention. In this preferred embodiment, a device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is arranged along an optical fiber transmission line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for transmitting the signal light. An optical receiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is provided downstream of the device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Alternatively, the device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> according to the present invention may be provided at a most downstream end of the optical fiber transmission line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Further, a plurality of devices according to the present invention may be arranged along the optical fiber transmission line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> With this configuration, the signal light transmitted by the optical fiber transmission line <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> undergoes waveform shaping in accordance with the principle of the present invention. Accordingly, the waveform-shaped signal light received by the optical receiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can obtain a better SN ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is known that the degradation in SN ratio of signal light is one of the factors of transmission limit to signal light. To increase a transmission distance, the improvement in SN ratio is desirable. However, an optical receiver now in use has no additional function of improving the SN ratio of signal light, and any method of shaping the waveform of a high-speed signal with a compact and simple configuration of an electronic circuit has not yet been established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> according to the present invention can shape the waveform of high-speed signal light without O/E conversion independently of a bit rate. Accordingly, by placing the device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> upstream of the optical receiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a required receiving power in the optical receiver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Further, by maintaining a receiver sensitivity constant, the transmission distance can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention as described above, it is possible to provide a method and device for shaping the waveform of signal light independently of the modulation rate and format of the signal light. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a method and device for shaping the waveform of signal light independently of the polarization state of the signal light. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a method and device for shaping the waveform of signal light which can easily simplify a device configuration. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a method and device for shaping the waveform of signal light with or without wavelength conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the details of the above described preferred embodiments. The scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and all changes and modifications as fall within the equivalence of the scope of the claims are therefore to be embraced by the invention. </paragraph>
