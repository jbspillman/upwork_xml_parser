<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to interactive television program guide systems and, more particularly, to interactive television program guide systems that support research activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Interactive television program guide systems have been developed to aid users in conducting television related activity. For example, an interactive television program guide system may be used to change channels, to set reminders, to record programs, etc. Illustrative interactive television program guides are described, for example, in Knee et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,892, Knudson et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/070,555, filed Apr. 30, 1998, and Knudson et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/357,941, filed Jul. 16, 1999, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. Illustrative client-server program guide systems are described, for example, in Ellis et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/374,043, filed Aug. 13, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Program guides may be on-line program guides, which may be implemented using a web server on the Internet. Illustrative on-line program guide systems are described, for example, in Boyer et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/938,028, filed Sep. 18, 1997, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Interactive program guides or other interactive television applications may allow users to record programs on digital or analog storage devices (e.g., videocassettes, hard disks, floppy discs, flash memory, recordable compact discs, recordable digital versatile discs, or any other type of storage). Illustrative interactive program guides having digital storage are described, for example, in Hassel et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/157,256, filed Sep. 17, 1998, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Recording of media can also be performed by a program guide or other server. Examples of program guides that have remote server recording features are illustratively shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/332,244, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While it is useful to facilitate user interaction with the program guide, it may also be desirable to know what particular interactions occur between a user and a guide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Information on program guide and user activity may be of great value to researchers and advertisers. Using such information, researchers may ascertain desired information for a wide range of research purposes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the present invention an interactive television application may be provided for researching interactive television application and/or user activity and storing information related to the application and/or user activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A data collection device may be implemented at user equipment for collecting and/or generating data. An interactive television application may have been implemented using user equipment that may interface with user through a user input device, through displays that are presented to the user, through the activity in the displays that are presented to the user, through selections that the user makes, through key entries on the user input device, etc. Data may be generated and/or collected by the data collection device for actions (e.g., discrete acts) occurring between the user and the application to interface the user and the application. Different classes of data may be generated. For example, one class of data may be data that is valuable to advertisers in determining where to present advertisements to a particular user and the pricing for advertisements. Another class may be data that is valuable to researchers to recreate how a user has interacted with an application to identify the effectiveness of the features implemented in the application. Another class may be data that is valuable for identifying a profile for a user. Other classes of data may also exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Data may be generated for a wide range of actions, which are further discussed below. Data collected by a data collection device may be stored locally and/or transmitted to a central facility. Generated data may be screened to filter out some of the data. Research processes or algorithms may be applied to the data of the data collection device to produce resultant information. Confidentiality features may be provided. An interactive television application system that includes research features may log events to track television, application, and user activity. The information that is logged may be used to support research studies. Data that is generated may be data for identifying acts that are manually taken by a user (e.g., user key entries) and for automatic acts that are driven by the interactive television application (e.g., the application displays a reminder). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Data may be collected in substantially raw form to be flexible for use in a wide range of studies. A software version for an interactive television application may be sent to the central facility. The software version may aid in interpreting the collected data, collected from a number of different user equipment. </paragraph>

The video signals may be signals generated by storage device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, signals from storage device <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, signals tuned by set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, or signals directly received by television <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (e.g., received through an antenna). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may include memory <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Memory <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may be practically any type of memory or storage, such as random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), a hard disc drive, a combination of such devices, etc., that is suitable for storing instructions for applications and for storing data. Set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may include communications device <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> for communicating with television distribution facility <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (e.g., communicating with server <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Communications device <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may be a modem (e.g., any suitable digital or analog standard, cellular, or cable modem), a network interface card (e.g., an Ethernet card, Token ring card, etc.), or other suitable communications device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> User equipment <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may communicate with set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> via conversion device <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A data collection device such as data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may communicate with a central facility (e.g., central facility <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) through set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> or through some other communication capable device such as an internal modem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> illustratively show different possible arrangements for user equipment <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Other arrangements may also be used. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be coupled to storage device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and/or television <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> when an interactive television application has been implemented on storage device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and/or television <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be part of set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (if set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has suitable processing circuitry and memory). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Various techniques may be used to establish communications between data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and an interactive television application implemented on user equipment <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, with reference again now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, conversion device <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> may be used to convert signals between set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and data collection <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may have a communications port such as an infrared communications port (e.g., an IR blaster port) for controlling storage device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may have a communications port for communicating with other user equipment. The communications port of data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be a port that is for electrical signal communications. The communications port of set-top box <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be directed towards conversion device <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>, which may be coupled to the communications port of data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Conversion device <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> may perform a signal type conversion (e.g., infrared to electrical conversion), a data format conversion, signal level conversion, and other signal modifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Data collection device <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may share processing communications, and/or storage resources with other equipment in user equipment <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or may have separate (e.g., dedicated) processing, communications and/or storage resources. Combinations of shared and separate resources may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Illustrative steps involved in providing data collection are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, at step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, an interactive television application may be implemented using user equipment to aid a user in managing resources (e.g., television channels) that are available through the user equipment. The resources may be made available to the user through the interactive television application or in cooperation with the interactive television application. The interactive television application may present information, audiovisuals, advertisements, display screens, overlays, options for different application features, etc. to a user. As mentioned above, a user input device may be used to interact with the interactive television application. Information, audiovisuals, advertisements, display screens, overlays, options, etc. that are presented to a user form part of an application interface. The application interface may further include user input device entries made by that user. At step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a data collection device may be implemented at the user equipment to collect data on activity at the interface. At step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, data may be generated for discrete actions that occur at the application interface of that user. Data may be generated for more than one class of interaction. For example data may be generated for user selections made through the application and generated user interactions at the application interface (e.g., actions taken to make a selection). Different classes of information may be differentiated or identified based on the focus for which the information is collected. For example, one class of information may be information that is collected to identify parameters for a user profile. Another class of information may be collected having another focus (e.g., system usability). Another example may involve differentiating between information that is collected to identify where to place advertisements (e.g., how to target advertisements to a particular user, what prices should be charged for different advertisement locations, etc.) and information that is collected for another focus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, the data that has been generated may be stored. The data may be stored in digital storage of the data collection device, in a set-top box, television, in a video storage device, in a television distribution facility, or in combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow chart of illustrative steps involved in selectively collecting data from different households. At step <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, a data collection device may be implemented in a number of households (e.g., implemented for substantially all user equipment that is deployed or for a statistically significant subset of the user equipment that is deployed). At step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, data collection may be selectively enabled for a subset of the households in which the data collection device was implemented. If desired, a data collection device may be selectively enabled when the data collection device has been implemented and has established appropriate communications with an interactive television application from which the device will be receiving data. At step <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>, data may be collected based on actions occurring at the user-application level. Data may be collected/generated using the enabled data collection devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Depending on the communications arrangement that is used, data may be collected or stored in a number of different ways. For example, data may be collected and stored locally and later sent to a central facility. Another example may involve collecting the data locally and passing the data to a central facility without locally storing the data in nonvolatile memory. The data collection device may be in communications with an interactive television application and/or a central facility using a handshaking technique, using two-way communications techniques, using one way communications techniques, using periodic communications techniques, using on-demand communications techniques, using other communications techniques, or combinations of these techniques as appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> If desired, a polling type communications technique may be used for sending data to a central facility. A central facility may broadcast (e.g., broadcast through a television distribution facility) messages that poll particular data collection devices for data at step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. Polling step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> may be a substep of step <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. Polling messages may identify which data collection devices are to provide data to the central facility. The polling messages may also be used to configure when and how the data collection device is to send the data. For example, a polling message may set the schedule for when to send data and may specify a telephone number that is to be used to establish a communications connection for sending the data. At step <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, the data may be analyzed. For example, the data may be analyzed to recreate activity that has occurred between a user and an application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Data collection may be provided to obtain individual histories of activities and to provide cumulative activity data. For example, with reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, interface parameters may be established using steps <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, a user may be allowed to interact with an interactive television application through a user input device (e.g., a remote control). At step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, the interactive television application may interface with the user through application-generated graphics (e.g., display screens) that are presented to the user on a display device. At step <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, the interactive television application may identify channels, programs, etc. that are viewed or accessed by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, data identifying discrete activity occurring in steps <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, and/or <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> may be recorded. Duration information for the activity (e.g., each activity) may also be recorded. An individual data record may be generated for each activity that is representative of that activity. At step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, cumulative data may be recorded on the discrete activity. The cumulative data may be for a particular period of time and may be representative of the rate of repetition or usage of discrete events over a particular period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing illustrative steps involved in storing research data. At step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, data (e.g., a data record) may be generated that is related to interface activity. Data may be representative of discrete acts that have occurred in an application interface. Data may be generated for each discrete act at the application interface. If desired, data may be generated for a subset of discrete acts that can occur in an application interface. (e.g., one data item may represent an aggregation of multiple actions, one data item may represent a statistical subset of multiple actions, or data items may be logged for only selected actions). Thus, the data may be an activity log for an interactive television application, or may be an activity log for particular functionality in the interactive television application (e.g., parental control, cursor movement, user input, etc.). Data may be collected for a number of different purposes or may be collected in mass before the research purposes for which the data is to be used have been identified. Research purposes may include purposes such as research related to quality of service, usability, demographics, trends, or gathering of television channel viewing statistics or measurement/verification of television, program guide or interactive television application advertising impression levels (e.g., different graphics that have different levels of detail of information for an advertisement), etc. If desired, at step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, data that has been generated may be screened to filter out some data based on current research criteria. For example, activity that is of lesser research value may be disregarded. At step <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, the screened data may be processed by applying preliminary research techniques to reduce the volume of the data. For example, a particular research algorithm or process may be implemented as part of the data collection device to extract demographic information from activity on which data was collected. The information may be extracted based on criteria such as the time at which programming was watched, for how long programming was watched, the viewing frequency of the channels or programs that were watched, actions that occurred in connection with parental control features, actions that occurred in connection with paid services, actions that occurred at a prior time, demographic information that has been separately collected, etc. At step <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, the data may be stored at the user equipment and/or transmitted to the central facility for storage and/or analysis. Data may be transmitted frequently to the central facility to save on a storage device at the collection device. Data compression techniques may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> If desired, steps <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> may be implemented without performing steps <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. Also if desired, steps <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> may be performed entirely at the user equipment or distributed over different sites (e.g., performed at user equipment and a central facility). Steps <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> may be used to reduce the volume or amount of data that is generated and/or stored at user equipment. For example aggregation processing techniques may be applied to reduce the amount of data. Some data may be aggregated, for example, to obtain cumulative information. Processing may be performed shortly or immediately after relevant data is generated. This may allow the system to store (e.g. only store) processed (e.g., aggregated) information for a particular data field or record without having to store incremental data that is generated for that field or record. For example, hourly channel viewing information may be determined using aggregated data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In one particular implementation, processing may be controlled by a central facility. For example, a central facility may command particular user equipment to process data to obtain aggregate information. The command may be sent by the central facility in a polling message sent to the user equipment. An application for processing the data may be resident at the user equipment or may be distributed over different sites (e.g., distributed over the user equipment and the central facility). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Screening data (e.g., step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>) and/or collecting data (e.g., step <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) may involve using particular memory addresses in user equipment to identify (implicitly identify) information that is to be communicated to a central facility. For example, particular data records may be selected implicitly by reference to or selected according to corresponding memory blocks in user equipment (e.g., memory blocks in a data collection device). This selection technique may be implemented without using explicit reference to a particular data record or data field that is stored in the user equipment. For example, a central facility may poll some user equipment to report data back by requesting information that is identified by the specific blocks of memory in the user equipment. The central facility may identify the bounds of memory (e.g., Hex002CB01A to HEX003A000) that contain the information that the central facility needs. This screening and/or data communication technique may be performed without having to explicitly identify data record types or attributes thereof. Software version information (e.g., the name or the version number) and/or user equipment identification information may be used by the central facility to determine which memory sections at user equipment (e.g., a particular type of user equipment) correspond to which data records or fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows illustrative data collection classes for generating interface data. Data or data records for a group (e.g., all) of the different classes may form an activity log. Data for each class may be generated in a format (e.g., a data record) from which that particular class or an activity under that particular class may be identified. Data may be generated as data records that can be imported into conventional database applications. For example, for each particular act that occurs a data record may be generated that has a number of predetermined fields that are separated by a marker such as a semicolon. The data may be in raw format, for example, by simply containing a string of alphanumerical characters that cannot be readily understood upon user review (such as review using a text editor). Data records (e.g., every data record) may (when appropriate) include data that is representative of when the event occurred, data that is representative of the duration of the event, a checksum, data identifying the classification for a data record, an identifier for each data record, etc. In one technique, a leading character may be used for each data record to identify classification for that record. The above mentioned data fields apply to the specific classifications mentioned below, but are not mentioned again to prevent repetition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, one interface classification may be key press entry classification <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. Data may be generated for this classification when key entry on a user input device is recognized by the interactive television application. Data that is generated for key press entry <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may include an identifier for identifying which key was pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For turbo key classification <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when the user holds a key on a user input device long enough to generate a new action. This data may include a data record that includes a field for identifying the key that was pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For state change classification <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when the guide changes states. For example, a data record may be generated when a parent control state is entered (e.g., a parental control display screen is displayed when a parental control option is selected from a main menu mode, e.g., from a main menu display screen). A table of different states is discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For channel change classification <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when a new channel or a new program is tuned. The data may include a data record that includes a field for the channel identifier and a field for the program identifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For ad display classification <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when the guide displays a display screen that includes one or more advertisements. A data record may be generated for classification <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> that includes a data record having data fields for identifying the number of advertisements or the graphic type of advertisements (e.g., flip ads) and includes data fields for identifying which advertisements were displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> For information screen classification <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when the guide displays an information display screen. Data that may be generated for classification <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> may include a data record that includes data fields for identifying the type of information display screen that was displayed (e.g., an advertisement information display screen, a program information display screen, a channel information display screen, etc.) and for identifying the focus of the information (e.g., the channel, the program, the advertisement, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For highlight classification <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when a program or other selection is highlighted on practically any display of the program guide. A highlight window may be a window that can be moved under user control in program guide displays that are presented to users. Data may be generated to track the movement of the highlight window. Data may be generated for classification <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> that includes a data record that identifies the programs or other items that have been highlighted using the highlight window. To select an item, user may press a data entry key when the highlight window is positioned on that item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> For parental lock classification <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when a user interacts with parental control features. Data generated for classification <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> may include a data record that includes data fields for identifying whether a lock has been set or removed, identifying the type of lock that is set or removed (e.g., movie rating, program, television rating, channel, etc.), and the identity of what is being locked or unlocked (e.g., the channel, the rating, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For favorite channel classification <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when the user sets or clears favorite channels. Data generated for classification <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> may include a data record including fields for identifying whether a favorite channel was set or cleared and for identifying the channel that is involved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For setup classification <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when a user sets or clears setup options. A table of setup options is discussed below. Data may be generated for classification <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> that identifies the option and the change in setting that has occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For reset database classification <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, data may be generated when the program guide resets or purges the program guide database. Data that is generated for classification <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> may identify the reason for resetting or purging the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> For identification classification <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, data may be generated (e.g., generated periodically) that identifies the user equipment. Data that may be generated for classification <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> may include a data record that includes fields for identifying software versions, identifying hardware type, identifying the address of the hardware (e.g., address of a set-top box, television, VCR, etc.). The address may be used in the polling scheme discussed above to differentiate between different user equipment that have been deployed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For current status classification <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>, data may be generated periodically or at different intervals to indicate the current status of the interface. Data records may be generated using data record structures/coding used for the other classifications (e.g., channel change classification <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, parental lock classification <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>, etc.) to indicate the current state of the interface when a discrete change at the interface has not occurred for some time. This data record may serve as a confirmation of a previously generated data record. Other classification <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> may cover other data that may have been produced. For classification <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>, data may be generated for cumulative information such as for the cumulative amount of time programs in a particular genre was watched, for the cumulative amount of time a particular channel was watched, for the total amount of watching television viewing time, for the cumulative guide usage time, for the cumulative amount of time program listings were used, for the cumulative amount of time information display screens were used, for the cumulative amount of time since the hardware (e.g., the user equipment on which the interactive television application was implemented) was powered up, etc. From duration information, rate of usage over a period of time may be determined. For example, data may be produced for the frequency at which input device keys were pressed, the frequency at which a record button or option was used, the frequency at which a watch/tune button or option was used, the frequency at which a search button or option was used (e.g., used in general, used for a particular category, etc.), the frequency at which setup options were used, the frequency at which particular buttons were used to go directly to a particular channel or display screen, the frequency at which a guide button or option was used to go to an initial navigation screen of the interactive television application, the frequency at which displayed advertisements were selected. Other data that may be generated may include data on when, where, the display duration, and the screen location of a displayed advertisement, data on which portions of a television program were viewed, data on how long information display screens were viewed, etc. Data records (e.g., data records under other classification <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>) may be defined to include data fields that are derived from data generated from interface activity or is the result of combining (e.g., aggregating) data generated from interface activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Data related to specific display levels of an advertisement may also generated and stored. For example, data may be generated for an advertisement when an initial display region for a particular advertisement is displayed in a program guide display screen. Data may also be generated for a further display region that is displayed for that same advertisement when a user selects the initial display region to obtain additional information (e.g., data is generated for the further graphics that are displayed when an initial display graphic for an advertisement is selected). A data record may identify that an advertisement was selected and may include fields identifying duration of display, further user activity, etc. If desired, a pulse data record may be periodically generated to indicate current operability of an interactive television application. If desired some or all of the data described herein may be generated or produced at a data collection device at a user&apos;s home. Other data and/or other techniques for generating data may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Memory used in the normal operation of an interactive television application may be copied and used to recreate a history of user activity (e.g., mirror the activity). Blocks of memory may be transmitted to a central facility for analysis. Information about the software version of the interactive television application, the identity of the application, and the hardware on which the application was implemented may also be provided to the central facility. The blocks that are to be transmitted may be identified by the local hardware or by the central facility. One advantage of providing information in a raw data format (e.g., using data records) is that the raw data provides flexibility for applying the data to a wide range of research purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> For state change classification <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, discussed above, there may be a large number of different states that may be tracked. Table 1 below illustratively shows a list of different guide states and an illustrative data value that may be generated to identify each state.
