<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention is directed to nuclease resistant oligonucleotides which are useful as therapeutics, diagnostics, and research reagents. Sugar-modified oligonucleotides which are resistant to nuclease degradation and are capable of modulating the activity of DNA and RNA are provided. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It has been recognized that oligonucleotides can be used to modulate mRNA expression by a mechanism that involves the complementary hybridization of relatively short oligonucleotides to mRNA such that the normal, essential functions of these intracellular nucleic acids are disrupted. Hybridization is the sequence-specific base pair hydrogen bonding of an oligonucleotide to a complementary RNA or DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One deficiency of oligonucleotides for these purposes is their susceptibility to enzymatic degradation by a variety of ubiquitous nucleases which may be intracellularly and extracellularly located. Unmodified, &ldquo;wild type&rdquo;, oligonucleotides are not useful as therapeutic agents because they are rapidly degraded by nucleases. Therefore, modification of oligonucleotides for conferring nuclease resistance on them has been a focus of research directed towards the development of oligonucleotide therapeutics and diagnostics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to nuclease stability, the ability of an oligonucleotide to bind to a specific DNA or RNA with fidelity is a further important factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The relative ability of an oligonucleotide to bind to complementary nucleic acids is compared by determining the melting temperature of a particular hybridization complex. The melting temperature (T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>), a characteristic physical property of double helices, is the temperature (in &deg; C.) at which 50% helical versus coil (unhybridized) forms are present. T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is measured by using UV spectroscopy to determine the formation and breakdown (melting) of hybridization. Base stacking, which occurs during hybridization, is accompanied by a reduction in UV absorption (hypochromicity). Consequently, a reduction in UV absorption indicates a higher T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>. The higher the T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>, the greater the strength of the binding of the nucleic acid strands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, oligonucleotides modified to exhibit resistance to nucleases and to hybridize with appropriate strength and fidelity to its targeted RNA (or DNA) are greatly desired for use as research reagents, diagnostic agents and as oligonucleotide therapeutics. Various 2&prime;-substitutions have been introduced in the sugar moiety of oligonucleotides. The nuclease resistance of these compounds has been increased by the introduction of 2&prime;-substituents such as halo, alkoxy and allyloxy groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Ikehara et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>European Journal of Biochemistry </italic></highlight>139, 447 (1984)&rsqb; have reported the synthesis of a mixed octamer containing one 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoroguanosine residue or one 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoroadenine residue. Guschlbauer and Jankowski &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>8, 1421 (1980)&rsqb; have shown that the contribution of the 3&prime;-endo increases with increasing electronegativity of the 2&prime;-substituent. Thus, 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluorouridine contains 85% of the C3&prime;-endo conformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, evidence has been presented which indicates that 2&prime;-substituted-2&prime;-deoxyadenosine polynucleotides resemble double-stranded RNA rather than DNA. Ikehara et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res., </italic></highlight>5, 3315 (1978)&rsqb; have shown that a 2&prime;-fluoro substituent in poly A, poly I, or poly C duplexed to its complement is significantly more stable than the ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide poly duplex as determined by standard melting assays. Ikehara et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res., </italic></highlight>4, 4249 (1978)&rsqb; have shown that a 2&prime;-chloro or bromo substituent in poly(2&prime;-deoxyadenylic acid) provides nuclease resistance. Eckstein et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Biochemistry, </italic></highlight>11, 4336 (1972)&rsqb; have reported that poly(2&prime;-chloro-2&prime;-deoxyuridylic acid) and poly(2&prime;-chloro-2&prime;-deoxycytidylic acid) are resistant to various nucleases. Inoue et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Research, </italic></highlight>15, 6131 (1987)&rsqb; have described the synthesis of mixed oligonucleotide sequences containing 2&prime;-OMe substituents on every nucleotide. The mixed 2&prime;-OMe-substituted oligonucleotide hybridized to its RNA complement as strongly as the RNA-RNA duplex which is significantly stronger than the same sequence RNA-DNA heteroduplex (T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>s, 49.0 and 50.1 versus 33.0 degrees for nonamers). Shibahara et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Research, </italic></highlight>17, 239 (1987)&rsqb; have reported the synthesis of mixed oligonucleotides containing 2&prime;-OMe substituents on every nucleotide. The mixed 2&prime;-OMe-substituted oligonucleotides were designed to inhibit HIV replication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is believed that the composite of the hydroxyl group&apos;s steric effect, its hydrogen bonding capabilities, and its electronegativity versus the properties of the hydrogen atom is responsible for the gross structural difference between RNA and DNA. Thermal melting studies indicate that the order of duplex stability (hybridization) of 2&prime;-methoxy oligonucleotides is in the order of RNA-RNA&gt;RNA-DNA&gt;DNA-DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,830, issued May 7, 1991, discloses mixed oligonucleotides comprising an RNA portion, bearing 2&prime;-O-alkyl substituents, conjugated to a DNA portion via a phosphodiester linkage. However, being phosphodiesters, these oligonucleotides are susceptible to nuclease cleavage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> European Patent application 339,842, filed Apr. 13, 1989, discloses 2&prime;-O-substituted phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, including 2&prime;-O-methylribooligonucleotide phosphorothioate derivatives. This application also discloses 2&prime;-O-methyl phosphodiester oligonucleotides which lack nuclease resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> European Patent application 260,032, filed Aug. 27, 1987, discloses oligonucleotides having 2&prime;-O-methyl substituents on the sugar moiety. This application also makes mention of other 2&prime;-O-alkyl substituents, such as ethyl, propyl and butyl groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> International Publication Number WO 91/06556, published May 16, 1991, discloses oligomers derivatized at the 2&prime; position with substituents, which are stable to nuclease activity. Specific 2&prime;-O-substituents which were incorporated into oligonucleotides include ethoxycarbonylmethyl (ester form), and its acid, amide and substituted amide forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> European Patent application 399,330, filed May 15, 1990, discloses nucleotides having 2&prime;-O-alkyl substituents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> International Publication Number WO 91/15499, published Oct. 17, 1991, discloses oligonucleotides bearing 2&prime;-O-alkyl, -alkenyl and -alkynyl substituents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It has been recognized that nuclease resistance of oligonucleotides and fidelity of hybridization are of great importance in the development of oligonucleotide therapeutics. Oligonucleotides possessing nuclease resistance are also desired as research reagents and diagnostic agents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The compositions useful for modulating the activity of an RNA or DNA molecule in accordance with this invention generally comprise a sugar-modified oligonucleotide which is specifically hybridizable with a preselected nucleotide sequence of a single-stranded or double-stranded target DNA or RNA molecule, and which is nuclease resistant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is generally desirable to select a sequence of DNA or RNA which is involved in the production of a protein whose synthesis is ultimately to be modulated or inhibited in its entirety. The oligonucleotides of the invention are conveniently synthesized using solid phase synthesis of known methodology, and is designed to be complementary to or specifically hybridizable with the preselected nucleotide sequence of the target RNA or DNA. Nucleic acid synthesizers are commercially available and their use is understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art as being effective in generating any desired oligonucleotide of reasonable length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The oligonucleotides of the invention also include those that comprise nucleosides connected by charged linkages, and whose sequences are divided into at least two subsequences. The first subsequence includes 2&prime;-substituted-nucleosides linked by a first type of linkage. The second subsequence includes nucleosides linked by a second type of linkage. In a preferred embodiment there exists a third subsequence whose nucleosides are selected from those selectable for the first subsequence, and the second subsequence is positioned between the first and the third subsequences. Such oligonucleotides of the invention are known as &ldquo;chimeras,&rdquo; or &ldquo;chimeric&rdquo; or &ldquo;gapped&rdquo; oligonucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the context of this invention, the term &ldquo;oligonucleotide&rdquo; refers to a plurality of nucleotides joined together in a specific sequence from naturally and non-naturally occurring nucleobases. Preferred nucleobases of the invention are joined through a sugar moiety via phosphorus linkages, and include adenine, guanine, adenine, cytosine, uracil, thymine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl, 2-propyl and other alkyl adenines, 5-halo uracil, 5-halo cytosine, 6-aza uracil, 6-aza cytosine and 6-aza thymine, pseudo uracil, 4-thiouracil, 8-halo adenine, 8-aminoadenine, 8-thiol adenine, 8-thiolalkyl adenines, 8-hydroxyl adenine and other 8-substituted adenines, 8-halo guanines, 8-amino guanine, 8-thiol guanine, 8-thiolalkyl guanines, 8-hydroxyl guanine and other 8-substituted guanines, other aza and deaza uracils, other aza and deaza thymidines, other aza and deaza cytosines, other aza and deaza adenines, other aza and deaza guanines, 5-trifluoromethyl uracil and 5-trifluoro cytosine. The sugar moiety may be deoxyribose or ribose. The oligonucleotides of the invention may also comprise modified nucleobases or nucleobases having other modifications consistent with the spirit of this invention, and in particular modifications that increase their nuclease resistance in order to facilitate their use as therapeutic, diagnostic or research reagents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The oligonucleotides of the present invention are about 5 to about 50 bases in length. It is more preferred that the oligonucleotides of the invention have from 8 to about 40 bases, and even more preferred that from about 12 to about 25 bases be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is desired that the oligonucleotides of the invention be adapted to be specifically hybridizable with the nucleotide sequence of the target RNA or DNA selected for modulation. oligonucleotides particularly suited for the practice of one or more embodiments of the present invention comprise 2&prime;-sugar modified oligonucleotides wherein one or more of the 2&prime;-deoxy ribofuranosyl moieties of the nucleoside is modified with a halo, alkoxy, aminoalkoxy, alkyl, azido, or amino group. For example, the substitutions which may occur include F, CN, CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, OCF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, OCN, O-alkyl, S-alkyl, SMe, SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Me, ONO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, NH-alkyl, OCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&boxH;CH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and OCCH. In each of these, alkyl is a straight or branched chain of C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>20</subscript></highlight>, having unsaturation within the carbon chain. A preferred alkyl group is C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>9 </subscript></highlight>alkyl. A further preferred alkyl group is C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A first preferred group of substituents include 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoro substituents. A further preferred group of substituents include C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkoxyl substituents. An additional preferred group of substituents include cyano, fluoromethyl, thioalkoxyl, fluoroalkoxyl, alkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, allyloxy and alkeneoxy substituents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In further embodiments of the present invention, the individual nucleotides of the oligonucleotides of the invention are connected via phosphorus linkages. Preferred phosphorus linkages include phosphodiester, phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate linkages. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, nuclease resistance is conferred on the oligonucleotides by utilizing phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In further embodiments of the invention, nucleosides can be joined via linkages that substitute for the internucleoside phosphate linkage. Macromolecules of this type have been identified as oligonucleosides. The term &ldquo;oligonucleoside&rdquo; thus refers to a plurality of nucleoside units joined by non-phosphorus linkages. In such oligonucleosides the linkages include an &mdash;O&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;O&mdash; linkage (i.e., an ethylene glycol linkage) as well as other novel linkages disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,618, issued Jun. 29, 1993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,825, issued Jan. 3, 1995 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/395,168, filed Feb. 27, 1995. Other modifications can be made to the sugar, to the base, or to the phosphate group of the nucleotide. Representative modifications are disclosed in International Publication Numbers WO 91/10671, published Jul. 25, 1991, WO 92/02258, published Feb. 20, 1992, WO 92/03568, published Mar. 5, 1992, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,138,045, issued Aug. 11, 1992, all assigned to the assignee of this application. The disclosures of each of the above referenced publications are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the context of this invention, &ldquo;hybridization&rdquo; shall mean hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleotides. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. &ldquo;Complementary,&rdquo; as used herein, also refers to sequence complementarity between two nucleotides. For example, if a nucleotide at a certain position of an oligonucleotide is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleotide at the same position of a DNA or RNA molecule, then the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are considered to be complementary to each other at that position. The oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleotides which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, &ldquo;specifically hybridizable&rdquo; and &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA target. It is understood that an oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target DNA sequence to be specifically hybridizable. An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligonucleotide to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e. under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, or in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Cleavage of oligonucleotides by nucleolytic enzymes require the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex, or in particular a nuclease-oligonucleotide complex. The nuclease enzymes will generally require specific binding sites located on the oligonucleotides for appropriate attachment. If the oligonucleotide binding sites are removed or blocked, such that nucleases are unable to attach to the oligonucleotides, the oligonucleotides will be nuclease resistant. In the case of restriction endonucleases that cleave sequence-specific palindromic double-stranded DNA, certain binding sites such as the ring nitrogen in the 3- and 7-positions have been identified as required binding sites. Removal of one or more of these sites or sterically blocking approach of the nuclease to these particular positions within the oligonucleotide has provided various levels of resistance to specific nucleases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> This invention provides oligonucleotides possessing superior hybridization properties. Structure-activity relationship studies have revealed that an increase in binding (T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>) of certain 2&prime;-sugar modified oligonucleotides to an RNA target (complement) correlates with an increased &ldquo;A&rdquo; type conformation of the heteroduplex. Furthermore, absolute fidelity of the modified oligonucleotides is maintained. Increased binding of 2&prime;-sugar modified sequence-specific oligonucleotides of the invention provides superior potency and specificity compared to phosphorus-modified oligonucleotides such as methyl phosphonates, phosphate triesters and phosphoramidates as known in the literature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The only structural difference between DNA and RNA duplexes is a hydrogen atom at the 2&prime;-position of the sugar moiety of a DNA molecule versus a hydroxyl group at the 2&prime;-position of the sugar moiety of an RNA molecule (assuming that the presence or absence of a methyl group in the uracil ring system has no effect). However, gross conformational differences exist between DNA and RNA duplexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It is known from X-ray diffraction analysis of nucleic acid fibers &lsqb;Arnott and Hukins, <highlight><italic>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communication, </italic></highlight>47, 1504-1510 (1970)&rsqb; and analysis of crystals of double-stranded nucleic acids that DNA takes a &ldquo;B&rdquo; form structure and RNA takes the more rigid &ldquo;A&rdquo; form structure. The difference between the sugar puckering (C2&prime; endo for &ldquo;B&rdquo; form DNA and C3&prime; endo for &ldquo;A&rdquo; form RNA) of the nucleosides of DNA and RNA is the major conformational difference between double-stranded nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The primary contributor to the conformation of the pentofuranosyl moiety is the nature of the substituent at the 2&prime;-position. Thus, the population of the C3&prime;-endo form increases with respect to the C2&prime;-endo form as the electronegativity of the 2&prime;-substituent increases. For example, among 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-haloadenosines, the 2&prime;-fluoro derivative exhibits the largest population (65%) of the C3&prime;-endo form, and the 2&prime;-iodo exhibits the lowest population (7%). Those of adenosine (2&prime;-OH) and deoxyadenosine (2&prime;-H) are 36% and 19%, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of the 2&prime;-fluoro group of adenosine dimers (2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoroadenosine -2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoroadenosine) is further correlated to the stabilization of the stacked conformation. Research indicates that dinucleoside phosphates have a stacked conformation with a geometry similar to that of A-A but with a greater extent of base-base overlapping than A-A. It is assumed that the highly polar nature of the C2&prime;-F bond and the extreme preference for C3&prime;-endo puckering may stabilize the stacked conformation in an &ldquo;A&rdquo; structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Data from UV hypochromicity, circular dichromism, and <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR also indicate that the degree of stacking decreases as the electronegativity of the halo substituent decreases. Furthermore, steric bulk at the 2&prime;-position of the sugar moiety is better accommodated in an &ldquo;A&rdquo; form duplex than a &ldquo;B&rdquo; form duplex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thus, a 2&prime;-substituent on the 3&prime;-nucleotidyl unit of a dinucleoside monophosphate is thought to exert a number of effects on the stacking conformation: steric repulsion, furanose puckering preference, electrostatic repulsion, hydrophobic attraction, and hydrogen bonding capabilities. These substituent effects are thought to be determined by the molecular size, electronegativity, and hydrophobicity of the substituent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The 2&prime;-iodo substituted nucleosides possess the lowest C3&prime;-endo population (7%) of the halogen series. Thus, base solely on steric effects, one would predict that a 2&prime;-iodo (or other similar group) would contribute stacking destabilization properties, and thus reduced binding (T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>) of the oligonucleotides. However, the lower electronegativity and high hydrophobicity of the iodine atom (or another similar group) complicates the ability to predict stacking stabilities and binding strengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Studies with a 2&prime;-OMe modification of 2&prime;-deoxy guanosine, cytidine, and uridine dinucleoside phosphates exhibit enhanced stacking effects with respect to the corresponding unmethylated species (2&prime;-OH). In this case, the hydrophobic attractive forces of the methyl group tend to overcome the destablilizing effects of its steric bulk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> 2&prime;-Fluoro-2&prime;-deoxyadenosine has been determined to have an unusually high population of 3&prime;-endo puckered form among nucleosides. Adenosine, 2&prime;-deoxyadenosine and other derivatives have less than 40% of their population in the 3&prime;-endo conformation. It is known that a nucleoside residue in well-stacked oligonucleotides favors 3&prime;-endo ribofuranose puckering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Melting temperatures (complementary binding) are increased with the 2&prime;-substituted adenosine diphosphates. It is not clear whether the 3&prime;-endo preference of the conformation or the presence of the substituent is responsible for the increased binding. However, greater overlap of adjacent bases (stacking) can be achieved with the 3&prime;-endo conformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Compounds of the invention can be utilized as diagnostics, therapeutics and as research reagents and kits. They can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by adding an effective amount of an oligonucleotide of the invention to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. They further can be used for treating organisms having a disease characterized by the undesired production of a protein. The organism can be contacted with an oligonucleotide of the invention having a sequence that is capable of specifically hybridizing with a strand of target nucleic acid that codes for the undesirable protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration is believed to be within the skill of those in the art. In general, for therapeutics, a patient in need of such therapy is administered an oligomer in accordance with the invention, commonly in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, in doses ranging from 0.01 &mgr;g to 100 g per kg of body weight depending on the age of the patient and the severity of the disease state being treated. Further, the treatment may be a single dose or may be a regimen that may last for a period of time which will vary depending upon the nature of the particular disease, its severity and the overall condition of the patient, and may extend from once daily to once every 20 years. Following treatment, the patient is monitored for changes in his/her condition and for alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state. The dosage of the oligomer may either be increased in the event the patient does not respond significantly to current dosage levels, or the dose may be decreased if an alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state is observed, or if the disease state has been ablated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In some cases it may be more effective to treat a patient with an oligomer of the invention in conjunction with other traditional therapeutic modalities. For example, a patient being treated for AIDS may be administered an oligomer in conjunction with AZT, or a patient with atherosclerosis may be treated with an oligomer of the invention following angioplasty to prevent reocclusion of the treated arteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease condition to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligomers, and can generally be estimated based on EC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>s found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 &mgr;g to 100 g per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to several years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the oligomer is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 &mgr;g to 100 g per kg of body weight, once or more daily, to once every several years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic, vaginal, rectal, intranasal, transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, or intrathecal or intraventricular administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets or tablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Compositions for intrathecal or intraventricular administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Formulations for parenteral administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be practiced in a variety of organisms ranging from unicellular prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to multicellular eukaryotic organisms. Any organism that utilizes DNA-RNA transcription or RNA-protein translation as a fundamental part of its hereditary, metabolic or cellular machinery is susceptible to such therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment. Seemingly diverse organisms such as bacteria, yeast, protozoa, algae, plant and higher animal forms, including warm-blooded animals, can be treated in this manner. Further, since each of the cells of multicellular eukaryotes also includes both DNA-RNA transcription and RNA-protein translation as an integral part of their cellular activity, such therapeutics and/or diagnostics can also be practiced on such cellular populations. Furthermore, many of the organelles, e.g. mitochondria and chloroplasts, of eukaryotic cells also include transcription and translation mechanisms. As such, single cells, cellular populations or organelles also can be included within the definition of organisms that are capable of being treated with the therapeutic or diagnostic oligonucleotides of the invention. As used herein, therapeutics is meant to include both the eradication of a disease state, killing of an organism, e.g. bacterial, protozoan or other infection, or control of aberrant or undesirable cellular growth or expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The present novel approach to obtaining stronger binding is to prepare RNA mimics that bind to target RNA. Therefore, a random structure-activity relationship approach was undertaken to discover nuclease resistant oligonucleotides that maintain appropriate hybridization properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A series of 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-modified nucleosides of adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymidine and certain analogs of these nucleobases have been prepared and incorporated into oligonucleotides via solid phase nucleic acid synthesis. These novel oligonucleotides were assayed for their hybridization properties and their ability to resist degradation by nucleases compared to the unmodified oligenucleotides. Initially, small electronegative atoms or groups were selected because they would not be expected to sterically interfere with required Watson-Crick base pair hydrogen bonding (hybridization). However, electronic changes due to the electronegativity of the atom or group in the 2&prime;-position may profoundly affect the sugar conformation. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that the sugar-modified oligonucleotides hybridized to the target RNA more strongly than the unmodified 2&prime;-deoxy oligonucleotides. </paragraph>

Appropriately3&prime;,5&prime;-sugar and base protected purine and pyrimidine nucleosides having a unprotected 2&prime;-hydroxyl group are converted to 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-substituted nucleosides by the process of oxidation to the 2&prime;-keto group, reaction with nucleophilic reagents, and finally 2&prime;-deoxygenation. Procedures of this type have been described by De las Heras, et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Tetrahedron Letters, </italic></highlight>29, 941 (1988)&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Procedure 9. In one process of the invention, 2&prime;-deoxy substituted guanosine compounds are prepared via an (arabinofuranosyl)guanine intermediate obtained via an oxidation-reduction reaction. A leaving group at the 2&prime; position of the arabinofuranosyl sugar moiety of the intermediate arabino compound is displaced via an SN<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>reaction with an appropriate nucleophile. This procedure thus incorporates principles of both Procedure 1 and Procedure 8 above. 2&prime;-Deoxy-2&prime;-fluoroguanosine is preferably prepared via this procedure. The intermediate arabino compound was obtained utilizing a variation of the oxidation-reduction procedure of Hansske et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Tetrahedron, </italic></highlight>40, 125 (1984)&rsqb;. According to this invention, the reduction was effected starting at &minus;78&deg; C. and allowing the reduction reaction to exothermically warm to about &minus;2&deg; C. This results in a high yield of the intermediate arabino compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In conjunction with use of a low temperature reduction, utilization of a tetraisopropyldisiloxane blocking group (a &ldquo;TPDS&rdquo; group) for the 3&prime; and 5&prime; positions of the starting guanosine compound contributes to an improved ratio of intermediate arabino compound to the ribo compound following oxidation and reduction. Following oxidation and reduction, the N<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>guanine amino nitrogen and the 2&prime;-hydroxyl moieties of the intermediate arabino compound are blocked with isobutyryl protecting groups (&ldquo;Ibu&rdquo; groups). The tetraisopropyldisiloxane blocking group is removed and the 3&prime; and 5&prime; hydroxy groups are further protected with a second blocking group, a tetrahydropyranyl blocking group (&ldquo;THP&rdquo; group). The isobutyryl group is selectively removed from 2&prime;-hydroxyl group followed by derivation of the 2&prime; position with a triflate leaving group. The triflate group was then displaced with inversion about the 2&prime; position to yield the desired 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoroguanosine compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In addition to the triflate leaving group, other leaving groups include, but are not limited to, alkylsulfonyl, substituted alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, substituted arylsulfonyl, heterocyclosulfonyl or trichloroacetimidate. Representative examples include p-(2,4-dinitroanilino)-benzenesulfonyl, benzenesulfonyl, methylsulfonyl, p-methyl-benzenesulfonyl, p-bromobenzenesulfonyl, trichloroacetimidate, acyloxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonyl, imidazolesulfonyl and 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The isobutyryl group remaining on the N<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>heterocyclic amino moiety of the guanine ring can be removed to yield a completely deblocked nucleoside. However, preferably, for incorporation of the 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-substituted compound into an oligonucleotide, deblocking of the 2 isobutyryl protecting group is deferred until after oligonucleotide synthesis is complete. Normally for use in automated nucleic acid synthesizers, blocking of the N<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>guanine moiety with an isobutyryl group is preferred. Thus, advantageously, the N<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>-isobutyryl-blocked 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-substituted guanosine compounds resulting from the method of the invention can be directly used for oligonucleotide synthesis on automated nucleic acid synthesizers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of illustration, the oligonucleotides of the invention have been used in a ras-luciferase fusion system using ras-luciferase transactivation. As described in International Publication Number WO 92/22651, published Dec. 23, 1992 and commonly assigned with this application, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference, the ras oncogenes are members of a gene family that encode related proteins that are localized to the inner face of the plasma membrane. Ras proteins have been shown to be highly conserved at the amino acid level, to bind GTP with high affinity and specificity, and to possess GTPase activity. Although the cellular function of ras gene products is unknown, their biochemical properties, along with their significant sequence homology with a class of signal-transducing proteins known as GTP binding proteins, or G proteins, suggest that ras gene products play a fundamental role in basic cellular regulatory functions relating to the transduction of extracellular signals across plasma membranes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Three ras genes, designated H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras, have been identified in the mammalian genome. Mammalian ras genes acquire transformation-inducing properties by single point mutations within their coding sequences. Mutations in naturally occurring ras oncogenes have been localized to codons 12, 13, and 61. The most commonly detected activating ras mutation found in human tumors is in codon-12 of the H-ras gene in which a base change from GGC to GTC results in a glycine-to-valine substitution in the GTPase regulatory domain of the ras protein product. This single amino acid change is thought to abolish normal control of ras protein function, thereby converting a normally regulated cell protein to one that is continuously active. It is believed that such deregulation of normal ras protein function is responsible for the transformation from normal to malignant growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The oligonucleotides of the present invention have also been used for modulating the expression of the raf gene, a naturally present cellular gene which occasionally converts to an activated form that has been implicated in abnormal cell proliferation and tumor formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The oligonucleotides of the present invention are also specifically hybridizable with nucleic acids relating to protein kinase C (PKC). These oligonucleotides have been found to modulate the expression of PKC. </paragraph>

The protected nucleoside is next chlorinated with thionyl chloride or phosphoryl chloride in pyridine or another appropriate basic solvent. The 4-chloro group is then displaced with ammonia in methanol. Deprotection of the sugar hydroxyls also takes place. The amino group is benzoylated and the acyl groups are selectively removed by aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Alternatively, the in situ process of first treating the nucleoside with chlorotrimethylsilane and base to protect the sugar hydroxyls from subsequent acylation may be employed. &lsqb;Ogilvie, <highlight><italic>Can J.

Another conversion approach is to replace the 4-chloro group with a 1,2,4-triazolo group which remains intact throughout the oligonucleotide synthesis on the automated synthesizer and is displaced by ammonia during treatment with ammonium hydroxide which cleaves the oligonucleotide from the CPG support and effects deprotection of the heterocycle. Furthermore, in many cases the 4-chloro group can be utilized as described and replaced at the end of oligonucleotide synthesis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-substituted nucleoside that will reside at the terminal 3&prime;-position of the oligonucleotide is protected as a 5&prime;-DMT group (the cytosine and adenine exocyclic amino groups are benzoylated and the guanine amino is isobutrylated) and treated with trifluoroacetic acid/bromoacetic acid mixed anhydride in pyridine and dimethylaminopyridine at 50&deg; C. for five hours. The solution is then evaporated under reduced pressure to a thin syrup which is dissolved in ethyl acetate and passed through a column of silica gel. The homogenous fractions are collected and evaporated to dryness. A solution of 10 mL of acetonitrile, 10 &mgr;M of the 3&prime;-O-bromomethylester-modified pyrimidine nucleoside, and 1 mL of pyridine/dimethylaminopyridine (1:1) is syringed slowly (60 to 90 sec) through a 1 &mgr;M column of CPG thymidine (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) that had previously been treated with acid according to standard conditions to afford the free 5&prime;-hydroxyl group. Other nucleoside-bound CPG columns may be employed. The eluent is collected and syringed again through the column. This process is repeated three times. The CPG column is washed slowly with 10 mL of acetonitrile and then attached to an ABI 380B nucleic acid synthesizer. Oligonucleotide synthesis is now initiated. The standard conditions of concentrated ammonium hydroxide deprotection that cleaves the thymidine ester linkage from the CPG support also cleaves the 3&prime;,5&prime; ester linkage connecting the pyrimidine modified nucleoside to the thymidine that was initially bound to the CPG nucleoside. In this manner, any 2&prime;-substituted nucleoside or generally any nucleoside with modifications in the heterocycle and/or sugar can be attached at the 3&prime; end of an oligonucleotide. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The ability of the 2&prime;- modified oligonucleotides to hybridize to their complementary RNA or DNA sequences was determined by thermal melting analysis. The RNA complement was synthesized from T7 RNA polymerase and a template-promoter of DNA synthesized with an Applied Biosystems, Inc. 380B RNA species was purified by ion exchange using FPLC (LKB Pharmacia, Inc.). Natural antisense oligonucleotides or those containing 2&prime;-modifications at specific locations were added to either the RNA or DNA complement at stoichiometric concentrations and the absorbance (260 nm) hyperchromicity upon duplex to random coil transition was monitored using a Gilford Response II spectrophotometer. These measurements were performed in a buffer of 10 mM Na-phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EDTA, and NaCl to yield an ionic strength of 10 either 0.1 M or 1.0 M. Data was analyzed by a graphic representation of 1/T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>vs ln&lsqb;Ct&rsqb;, where &lsqb;Ct&rsqb; was the total oligonucleotide concentration. From this analysis the thermodynamic parameters were determined. Based upon the information gained concerning the stability of the duplex of heteroduplex formed, the placement of modified pyrimidine into oligonucleotides were assessed for their effects on helix stability. Modifications that drastically alter the stability of the hybrid exhibit reductions in the free energy (delta G) and decisions concerning their usefulness as antisense oligonucleotides were made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> As is shown in the following table (Table 1), the incorporation of 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoro nucleotides into oligonucleotides resulted in significant increases in the duplex stability of the modified oligonucleotide strand (the antisense strand) and its complementary RNA strand (the sense strand). In both, phosphodiester backbone and phosphorothioate backbone oligonucleotides, the stability of the duplex increased as the number of 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoro-containing nucleotides in the antisense strand increased. As is evident from Table 1, without exception, the addition of a 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoro bearing nucleotide, irrespective of the individual substituent bearing nucleotide or the position of that nucleotide in the oligonucleotide sequence, resulted in an increase in the duplex stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> In Table 1, the underlined nucleotides represent nucleotides that include 1 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoro substituent.

<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> As is evident from Table 1, the duplexes formed between RNA and oligonucleotides containing 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoro substituted nucleotides exhibited increased binding stability as measured by the hybridization thermodynamic stability. Delta T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>s of greater than 20&deg; C. were measured. By modifying the backbone to a phosphorothioate backbone, even greater delta T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>s were observed. In this instance, delta T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>s greater than 31&deg; C. were measured. These fluoro-substituted oligonucleotides exhibited a consistent and additive increase in the thermodynamic stability of the duplexes formed with RNA. While we do not wish to be bound by theory, it is presently believed that the presence of a 2&prime;-fluoro substituent results in the sugar moiety of the 2&prime;-fluoro-substituted nucleotide assuming substantially a 3&prime;-endo conformation and this results in the oligonucleotide-RNA complex assuming an A-type helical conformation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">B. Fidelity of Hybridization of 2&prime;-modified Oligonucleotides </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> The ability of the 2&prime;-modified antisense oligonucleotides to hybridize with absolute specificity to the targeted mRNA was shown by Northern blot analysis of purified target mRNA in the presence of total cellular RNA. Target mRNA was synthesized from a vector containing the cDNA for the target mRNA located downstream from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Synthesized mRNA was electrophoresed in an agarose gel and transferred to a suitable support membrane (i.e. nitrocellulose). The support membrane was blocked and probed using <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled antisense oligonucleotides. The stringency will be determined by replicate blots and washing in either elevated temperatures or decreased ionic strength of the wash buffer. Autoradiography was performed to assess the presence of heteroduplex formation and the autoradiogram quantitated by laser densitometry (LKB Pharmacia, Inc.). The specificity of hybrid formation was determined by isolation of total cellular RNA by standard techniques and its analysis by agarose electrophoresis, membrane transfer and probing with the labeled 2&prime;-modified oligonucleotides. Stringency was predetermined for the unmodified antisense oligonucleotides and the conditions used such that only the specifically targeted mRNA was capable of forming a heteroduplex with the 2&prime;-modified oligonucleotide. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">A. Evaluation of the Resistance of 2&prime;-modified Oligonucleotides to Serum and Cytoplasmic Nucleases </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Natural phosphorothioate, and 2-modified oligonucleotides were assessed for their resistance to serum nucleases by incubation of the oligonucleotides in media containing various concentrations of fetal calf serum or adult human serum. Labeled oligonucleotides were incubated for various times, treated with protease K and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide-urea denaturing gels and subsequent autoradiography. Autoradiograms were quantitated by laser densitometry. Based upon the location of the modifications and the known length of the oligonucleotide it was possible to determine the effect on nuclease degradation by the particular 2&prime;-modification. For the cytoplasmic nucleases, a HL60 cell line was used. A post-mitochondrial supernatant was prepared by differential centrifugation and the labeled oligonucleotides were incubated in this supernatant for various times. Following the incubation, oligonucleotides were assessed for degradation as outlined above for serum nucleolytic degradation. Autoradiography results were quantitated for comparison of the unmodified, the phosphorothioates, and the 2&prime;-modified oligonucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Utilizing these test systems, the stability of a 15mer oligonucleotide having 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoro-substituted nucleotides at positions 12 and 14 and a phosphorothioate backbone were investigated. As a control, an unsubstituted phosphodiester oligonucleotide was 50% degraded within 1 hour, and 100% degraded within 20 hours. In comparison, for the 2&prime;-deoxy-2&prime;-fluoro-substituted oligonucleotide having a phosphorothioate backbone, degradation was limited to less that 10% after 20 hours. </paragraph>

Modified oligonucleotides were incubated in defined reaction buffers specific for various selected nucleases. Following treatment of the products with protease K, urea was added and analysis on 20% poly-acrylamide gels containing urea was done. Gel products were visualized by staining using Stains All (Sigma Chemical Co.). Laser densitometry was used to quantitate the extend of degradation. The effects of the 2&prime;-modifications were determined for specific nucleases and compared with the results obtained from the serum and cytoplasmic systems. </paragraph>

For phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, the standard oxidation bottle was replaced by 0.2 M solution of 3H-1,2-benzodithiole-3-one-1,1-dioxide in acetonitrile for the step wise thiation of the phosphite linkages. The thiation wait step was increased to 68 sec and was followed by the capping step. After cleavage from the CPG column and deblocking in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55&deg; C. (18 hours), the oligonucleotides were purified by precipitating twice with 2.5 volumes of ethanol from a 0.5 M NaCl solution. Analytical gel electrophoresis was accomplished in 20% acrylamide, 8 M urea, 454 mM Tris-borate buffer, pH&equals;7.0. Oligonucleotides and phosphorothioates were judged, based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, to be greater than 80% full-length material. </paragraph>

A series of complementary phosphorothioate oligonucleotides having 2&prime;-O-substituted nucleotides in regions that flank a 2&prime;-deoxy region were prepared utilizing 2&prime;-O-substituted nucleotide precursors prepared as per known literature preparations, i.e. 2&prime;-O-methyl, or as per the procedure of International Publication Number WO 92/03568, published Mar. 5, 1992. The 2&prime;-O-substituted nucleotides were added as their 5&prime;-O-dimethoxytrityl-3&prime;-phosphoramidites in the normal manner on the DNA synthesizer. The complementary oligonucleotides have the sequence of 5&prime; CGCAAAAAAAAAAAACGC 3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:33). The 2&prime;-O-substituent was located in CGC and CG regions of these oligonucleotides. The following 2&prime;-O-substituents were used: 2&prime;-fluoro; 2&prime;-O-methyl; 2&prime;-O-propyl; 2&prime;-O-allyl; 2&prime;-O-aminopropoxy; 2&prime;-O-(methoxyethoxyethyl), 2&prime;-O-imidazolebutoxy and 2&prime;-O-imidazolepropoxy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Ras-Luciferase Reporter Gene Assembly </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> The ras-luciferase reporter genes described in this study were assembled using PCR technology. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for use as primers for PCR cloning of the 5&prime;-regions of exon 1 of both the mutant (codon 12) and non-mutant (wild-type) human H-ras genes. H-ras gene templates were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC numbers 41000 and 41001) in Bethesda, Md. The oligonucleotide PCR primers 5&prime;-ACA-TTA-TGC-TAG-CTT-TTT-GAG-TAA-ACT-TGT-GGG-GCA-GGA-GAC-CCT-GT-3&prime; (sense) (SEQ ID NO:34), and 5&prime;-GAG-ATC-TGA-AGC-TTC-TGG-ATG-GTC-AGC-GC-3&prime; (antisense) (SEQ ID NO:35), were used in standard PCR reactions using mutant and non-mutant H-ras genes as templates. These primers are expected to produce a DNA product of 145 base pairs corresponding to sequences &minus;53 to &plus;65 (relative to the translational initiation site) of normal and mutant H-ras, flanked by NheI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites. The PCR product was gel purified, precipitated, washed and resuspended in water using standard procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> PCR primers for the cloning of the <highlight><italic>P. pyralis </italic></highlight>(firefly) luciferase gene were designed such that the PCR product would code for the full-length luciferase protein with the exception of the amino-terminal methionine residue, which would be replaced with two amino acids, an amino-terminal lysine residue followed by a leucine residue. The oligonucleotide PCR primers used for the cloning of the luciferase gene were 5&prime;-GAG-ATC-TGA-AGC-TTG-AAG-ACG-CCA-AAA-ACA-TAA-AG-3&prime; (sense) (SEQ ID NO:36), and 5&prime;-ACG-CAT-CTG-GCG-CGC-CGA-TAC-CGT-CGA-CCT-CGA-3&prime; (antisense) (SEQ ID NO:37), were used in standard PCR reactions using a commercially available plasmid (pT3/T7-Luc) (Clontech), containing the luciferase reporter gene, as a template. These primers were expected to yield a product of approximately 1.9 kb corresponding to the luciferase gene, flanked by HindIII and BssHII restriction endonuclease sites. This fragment was gel purified, precipitated, washed and resuspended in water using standard procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> To complete the assembly of the ras-luciferase fusion reporter gene, the ras and luciferase PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction endonucleases and cloned by three-part ligation into an expression vector containing the steroid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promotor MMTV using the restriction endonucleases NheI, HindIII and BssHII. The resulting clone results in the insertion of H-ras 5&prime; sequences (&minus;53 to &plus;65) fused in frame with the firefly luciferase gene. The resulting expression vector encodes a ras-luciferase fusion product which is expressed under control of the steroid-inducible MMTV promoter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Antisense Oligonucleotide Inhibition of ras-Luciferase Gene Expression </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> A series of antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide analogs targeted to the codon-12 point mutation of activated H-ras were tested using the ras-luciferase reporter gene system described in the foregoing examples. This series comprised a basic sequence and analogs of that basic sequence. The basic sequence was of known activity as reported in International Publication Number WO 92/22651 identified above. In both the basic sequence and its analogs, each of the nucleotide subunits incorporated phosphorothioate linkages to provide nuclease resistance. Each of the analogs incorporated nucleotide subunits that contained 2&prime;-O-methyl substitutions and 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl sugars. In the analogs, a subsequence of the 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl sugar-containing subunits was flanked on both ends by subsequences of 2&prime;-O-methyl substituted subunits. The analogs differed from one another with respect to the length of the subsequence of the 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl sugar containing nucleotides. The length of these subsequences varied by 2 nucleotides between 1 and 9 total nucleotides. The 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotide sub-sequences were centered at the point mutation of the codon-12 point mutation of the activated ras. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> The base sequences, sequence reference numbers and sequence ID numbers of these oligonucleotides (all are phosphorothioate analogs) are shown in Table 3.

<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows dose-response data in which cells were treated with the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides of Table 3. Oligonucleotide 2570 is targeted to the codon-12 point mutation of mutant (activated) H-ras RNA. The other nucleotides have 2&prime;-O-methyl substituents groups thereon to increase binding affinity with sections of various lengths of interspaced 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotides. The control oligonucleotide is a random phosphorothioate oligonucleotide analog, 20 bases long. Results are expressed as percentage of luciferase activity in transfected cells not treated with oligonucleotide. As the figure shows, treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of oligonucleotide 2570 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ras-luciferase activity in cells expressing the mutant form of ras-luciferase. Oligonucleotide 2570 displays an approximate threefold selectivity toward the mutant form of ras-luciferase as compared to the normal form. As is further seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each of the oligonucleotides 3980, 3985 and 3984 exhibited greater inhibition of ras-luciferase activity than did oligonucleotide 2570. The greatest inhibition was displayed by oligonucleotide 3985 that has a subsequence of 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotides seven nucleotides long. Oligonucleotide 3980, having a five nucleotide long 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotide subsequence exhibited the next greatest inhibition followed by oligonucleotide 3984 that has a nine nucleotide 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotide subsequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the results similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> except it is in bar graph form. Further seen on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is the activity of oligonucleotide 3975 and oligonucleotide 3979. These oligonucleotides have subsequences of 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotides one and three nucleotides long, respectively. As is evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, neither of the oligonucleotides having either the one or the three 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotide subsequences showed significant activity. There was measurable activity for the three nucleotide subsequence oligonucleotide 3979 at the highest concentration dose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The increases in activity of oligonucleotides 3980, 3985 and 3984 compared to oligonucleotide 2570 is attributed to the increase in binding affinity imparted to these compounds by the 2&prime;-O-methyl substituent groups located on the compounds and by the RNase H activation imparted to these compounds by incorporation of a subsequence of 2&prime;-deoxy-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleotides within the main sequence of nucleotides. In contrast to the active compounds of the invention, it is interesting to note that sequences identical to those of the active oligonucleotides 2570, 3980, 3985 and 3984 but having phosphodiester linkages in stead of the phosphorothioate linkages of the active oligonucleotides of the invention showed no activity. This is attributed to these phosphodiester compounds being substrates for nucleases that degrade such phosphodiester compounds thus preventing them potentially activating RNase H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Other sugar modifications: The effects of other 2&prime; sugar modifications besides 2&prime;-O-methyl on antisense activity in chimeric oligonucleotides have been examined. These modifications are listed in Table 4, along with the T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>values obtained when 17mer oligonucleotides having 2&prime;-modified nucleotides flanking a 7-base deoxy gap were hybridized with a 25mer oligoribonucleotide complement as described in Example 25. A relationship was observed for these oligonucleotides between alkyl length at the 2&prime; position and T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>. As alkyl length increased, T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>decreased. The 2&prime;-fluoro chimeric oligonucleotide displayed the highest T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>of the series.

<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Compound 2503 inhibited ras expression in T24 cells by 71%, and the chimeric compound (4998) inhibited ras mRNA even further (84% inhibition). Compound 2502, also complementary to the AUG region, decreased ras RNA levels by 26% and the chimeric version of this oligonucleotide (5122) demonstrated 15% inhibition. Also included in this assay were two oligonucleotides targeted to the mutant codon 12. Compound 2570 (SEQ ID NO:1) decreased ras RNA by 82% and the 2&prime;-O-methyl chimeric version of this oligonucleotide with a seven-deoxy gap (3985) decreased ras RNA by 95%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotides 2570 and 2503 were also tested to determine their effects on ras expression in HeLa cells, which have a wild-type (i.e., not activated) H-ras codon-12. While both of these oligonucleotides inhibited ras expression in T24 cells (having activated codon-12), only the oligonucleotide (2503) specifically hybridizable with the ras AUG inhibited ras expression in HeLa cells. Oligonucleotide 2570 (SEQ ID NO: 1), specifically hybridizable with the activated codon-12, did not inhibit ras expression in HeLa cells, because these cells lack the activated codon-12 target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotide 2570, a 17mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to the codon-12 region of activated H-ras, was tested for inhibition of ras expression (as described in Example 25) in T24 cells along with chimeric phosphorothioate 2&prime;-O-methyl oligonucleotides 3980, 3985 and 3984, which have the same sequence as 2570 and have deoxy gaps of 5, 7 and 9 bases, respectively (shown in Table 3). The fully 2&prime;-deoxy oligonucleotide 2570 and the three chimeric oligonucleotides decreased ras mRNA levels in T24 cells. Compounds 3985 (7-deoxy gap) and 3984 (9-deoxy gap) decreased ras mRNA by 81%; compound 3980 (5-deoxy gap) decreased ras mRNA by 61%. Chimeric oligonucleotides having this sequence, but having 2&prime;-fluoro-modified nucleotides flanking a 5-deoxy (4689) or 7-deoxy (4690) gap, inhibited ras mRNA expression in T24 cells, with the 7-deoxy gap being preferred (82% inhibition, vs 63% inhibition for the 2&prime;-fluoro chimera with a 5-deoxy gap). </paragraph>

Effects of these oligonucleotides on cancer cell proliferation correlated well with their effects on ras mRNA expression shown by Northern blot analysis: oligonucleotide 2570 inhibited cell proliferation by 61%, the 2&prime;-O-methyl chimeric oligonucleotide 3985 inhibited cell proliferation by 82%, and the 2&prime;-fluoro chimeric analog inhibited cell proliferation by 93%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In dose-response studies of these oligonucleotides on cell proliferation, the inhibition was shown to be dose-dependent in the 25 nM-100 nM range. IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>values of 44 nM, 61 nM and 98 nM could be assigned to oligonucleotides 4690, 3985 and 2570, respectively. The random oligonucleotide control had no effect at the doses tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> The effect of ISIS 2570 on cell proliferation was cell type-specific. The inhibition of T24 cell proliferation by this oligonucleotide was four times as severe as the inhibition of HeLa cells by the same oligonucleotide (100 nM oligonucleotide concentration). ISIS 2570 is targeted to the activated (mutant) ras codon-12, which is present in T24 but lacking in HeLa cells, which have the wild-type codon-12. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Chimeric backbone-modified oligonucleotides: Oligonucleotides discussed in previous examples have had uniform phosphorothioate backbones.

A chimeric oligonucleotide was synthesized (ISIS 4226) having 2&prime;-O-methyl regions flanking a 5-nucleotide deoxy gap, with the gap region having a P&boxH;S backbone and the flanking regions having a P&boxH;O backbone. Another chimeric oligonucleotide (ISIS 4223) having a P&boxH;O backbone in the gap and P&boxH;S in flanking regions was also made. These oligonucleotides are shown in Table 6. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotides were incubated in crude HeLa cellular extracts at 37&deg; C. to determine their sensitivity to nuclease degradation as described in Dignam et al. &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res., </italic></highlight>11, 1475 (1983)&rsqb;. The oligonucleotide (4233) with a 5-diester gap between phosphorothioate/2&prime;-O-methyl wings had a T<highlight><subscript>&frac12;</subscript></highlight> of 7 hr. The oligonucleotide with a five-phosphorothioate gap in a phosphorothioate/2&prime;-O-methyl molecule had a T<highlight><subscript>&frac12;</subscript></highlight> of 30 hours. In the set of oligonucleotides having one to ten diester linkages, the oligonucleotide (4248) with a single phosphodiester linkage was as stable to nucleases as was the full-phosphorothioate molecule, ISIS 2570, showing no degradation after 5 hours in HeLa cell extract. oligonucleotides with two-, three and four-diester gaps had T<highlight><subscript>&frac12;</subscript></highlight> of approximately 5.5 hours, 3.75 hours, and 3.2 hours, and oligonucleotides with five or ten deoxy linkages had T<highlight><subscript>&frac12;</subscript></highlight> of 1.75 hours and 0.9 hours, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Antisense activity of chimeric backbone-modified oligonucleotides: A uniform phosphorothioate backbone is not required for antisense activity. ISIS 4226 and ISIS 4233 were tested in the ras-luciferase reporter system for effect on ras expression along with ISIS 2570 (fully phosphorothioate/all deoxy), ISIS 3980 (fully phosphorothioate, 2&prime;-O-methyl wings with deoxy gap) and ISIS 3961 (fully phosphodiester, 2&prime;-O-methyl wings with deoxy gap). All of the oligonucleotides having a P&boxH;S (i.e., nuclease-resistant) gap region inhibited ras expression. The two completely 2,deoxy oligonucleotides having phosphorothioate backbones containing either a single phosphodiester (ISIS 4248) or ten phosphodiester linkages (ISIS 4241) in the center of the molecule were also assayed for activity. The compound containing a single P&boxH;O was just as active as a full P&boxH;S molecule, while the same compound containing ten P&boxH;O was completely inactive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Chimeric phosphorothioate oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1 were made, having a phosphorothioate backbone in the 7-base deoxy gap region only, and phosphodiester in the flanking regions, which were either 2&prime;-O-methyl or 2&prime;-O-propyl. The oligonucleotide with the 2&prime;-O-propyl diester flanking regions was able to inhibit ras expression. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> The expression plasmid pSV2-oli, containing an activated (codon 12, GGC&rarr;GTC) H-ras cDNA insert under control of the constitutive SV40 promoter, was a gift from Dr. Bruno Tocque (Rhone-Poulenc Sante, Vitry, France). This plasmid was used as a template to construct, by PCR, a H-ras expression plasmid under regulation of the steroid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. To obtain H-ras coding sequences, the 570 bp coding region of the H-ras gene was amplified by PCR. The PCR primers were designed with unique restriction endonuclease sites in their 5&prime;-regions to facilitate cloning. The PCR product containing the coding region of the H-ras codon 12 mutant oncogene was gel purified, digested, and gel purified once again prior to cloning. This construction was completed by cloning the insert into the expression plasmid pMAMneo (Clontech Laboratories, CA). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Chimeric oligonucleotides having SEQ ID NO:7 were designed using the Genbank c-raf sequence HUMRAFR (Genbank listing x03484), synthesized and tested for inhibition of c-raf mRNA expression in T24 bladder carcinoma cells using a Northern blot assay. These chimeric oligonucleotides have central &ldquo;gap&rdquo; regions of 6, 8 or 10 deoxynucleotides flanked by two regions of 2&prime;-O-methyl modified nucleotides, and are shown in Table 10. Backbones were uniformly phosphorothioate. In a Northern blot analysis, as described in Example 32, all three of these oligonucleotides (ISIS 6720, 6-deoxy gap; ISIS 6717, 8-deoxy gap; ISIS 6729, 10-deoxy gap) showed greater than 70% inhibition of c-raf mRNA expression in T24 cells. These oligonucleotides are preferred. The 8-deoxy gap compound (6717) showed greater than 90% inhibition and is more preferred.

For all experiments, cells were seeded the previous night at 75,000 cells/well in 6-well plates (Falcon). Transfections were performed using the standard CaPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>method. For each set of replicates, 15 &mgr;g/mL of pSG5/rev plasmid, 18 &mgr;g/mL pHIVenu-luc and 2 &mgr;g/mL of Rep 6 were precipitated and 200 &mgr;L of this was dripped on each well. The precipitate was allowed to incubate on cells for 7 hours at 37&deg; C. The media was then aspirated, the cells washed once with PBS, and fresh complete media added for overnight incubation. Following incubation, the media was removed, cells washed with 2 mL of OPTIMEM (GIBCO) and 1 mL of OPTIMEM containing 2.5 &mgr;g/mL of Lipofectin (GIBCO-BRL) and the oligonucleotide added. The mixture was incubated for 4 hours at 37&deg; C., at which point it was aspirated off the cells and complete media was added. Two hours after this treatment, 0.2 &mgr;M/mL of dexamethasone (Sigma) was added to all wells to allow induction of the MMTV promoter of pHIVenu-luc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The Luciferase assay was performed 24 hours later, as follows: The wells were washed twice with PBS and the cells were harvested by scraping in 200 &mgr;L of lysis buffer (1% Triton, 25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 4 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT)&gt; The lysate was clarified by microfuging for 5 minutes at 11,500 rpm in the cold. 100 &mgr;L of the lysate was then combined in a microtiter plate with 50 &mgr;L of assay buffer (25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 4 mM EGTA, 15 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT and 7.5 mM ATP). Luc detection was performed using a microtiter luminescent reader (Dynatech Laboratories). The reactions were started by injecting 50 &mgr;L of 1&times;luciferase solution (Sigma). The 1&times;solution was diluted in luciferin buffer (25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 4 mM EGTA and 4 mM DTT) prior to use from a 10&times;stock (10 mM luciferin in 10 mM DTT). Samples were counted for 20 seconds. The kinetics of firefly luc light emission are characterized by a flash period lasting a few seconds followed by a period of lower light intensity emission lasting several minutes. Rev and RRE RNA synthesis: pSG%-Rev contains the Rev gene adjacent to a T7 promoter. BglII linearized pSG5-Rev was used as a DNA template for transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. A template for the production of RRE RNA was produced by PCR. For RNA synthesis, DNA templates were used at 0.2 to 1.0 mg/mL, with 5 mM each of ATP, CTP and GTP, 0.5 mM of UTP, 10 mM of DTT, 40 mM of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 MM of MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 4 mM of Spermidine, 500 U/mL of RNAsin at 20 U/&mgr;L, 2500 &mgr;Ci/mL of &agr; <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P UTP at 10 mCi/mL and 1000 U/mL of T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction was incubated for 1 hour at 37&deg; C., The transcription reaction was terminated by adding formamide loading buffer and was run in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. The RNA was eluted from the gel according to the procedure of Schwartz et al. (<highlight><italic>Gene, </italic></highlight>1990, 88, 197). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> NHDF cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at a density of 15,000 cells/well in serum-free FGM. Established monolayers were pretreated with the oligonucleotide overnight in FGM prior to infection. After pretreatment, cells were rinsed thrice with fresh, prewarmed FGM, and virus in 100 &mgr;L of FGM/well was added to achieve an MOI of 0.05 PFU/cell. After 2 hours of incubation at 37&deg; C., virus was removed and fresh medium (100 &mgr;L/well) containing the oligonucleotide was added. Medium was exchanged 2 days after infection with fresh medium containing the oligonucleotide, and 6 days after infection, the cells were fixed in absolute ethanol and dried in preparation for antibody staining. A modified protocol was used for some assays in which FGM was supplemented with low levels of FBS (0.2%), and the incubation period after infection was shortened from 6 days to 3 days. The shorter assay eliminated the need to exchange medium 2 days after infection. Both assays yielded comparable values for 50% effective concentrations (EC50s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> Fixed cells were blocked in a solution of PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and mouse monoclonal antibody (1H10, supplied by Eisai Co., Ltd., Japan) was added in a 1:2000 dilution in PBS-1% BSA. The 1H10 antibody recognizes an abundant late HCMV polypeptide approximately 65 kDa in size. Detection of bound monoclonal antibody was facilitated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and streptavidin-coupled &bgr;-galactosidase (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.). Chlorophenol red &bgr;-D-galactopyranoside was used as a substrate for &bgr;-galactosidase, and activity was determined by measuring the optical density at 575 nm of individual wells with a BioTex model EL312e microplate reader. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotides are radiolabeled after synthesis by <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P labeling at the 5&prime; end with polynucleotide kinase. Sambrook et al. &lsqb;&ldquo;<highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual</italic></highlight>,&rdquo; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, Volume 2, pg. 11.31-11.32&rsqb;. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide is contacted with tissue or cell samples suspected of mRNA overexpression, such as a sample from a patient, under conditions in which specific hybridization can occur, and the sample is washed to remove unbound oligonucleotide. A similar control is maintained wherein the radiolabeled oligonucleotide is contacted with normal cell or tissue sample under conditions that allow specific hybridization, and the sample is washed to remove unbound oligonucleotide. Radioactivity remaining in the sample indicates bound oligonucleotide and is quantitated using a scintillation counter or other routine means. Comparison of the radioactivity remaining in the samples from normal and diseased cells indicates overexpression of the mRNA of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Radiolabeled oligonucleotides of the invention are also useful in autoradiography. Tissue sections are treated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide and washed as described above, then exposed to photographic emulsion according to standard autoradiography procedures. A control with normal cell or tissue sample is also maintained. The emulsion, when developed, yields an image of silver grains over the regions overexpressing the mRNA, which is quantitated. The extent of mRNA overexpression is determined by comparison of the silver grains observed with normal and diseased cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Analogous assays for fluorescent detection of mRNA expression use oligonucleotides of the invention which are labeled with fluorescein or other fluorescent tags. Labeled DNA oligonucleotides are synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 380B) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry with oxidation by iodine. &bgr;-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites are purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.). Fluorescein-labeled amidites are purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, Va.). Incubation of oligonucleotide and biological sample is carried out as described for radiolabeled oligonucleotides except that instead of a scintillation counter, a fluorescence microscope is used to detect the fluorescence. Comparison of the fluorescence observed in samples from normal and diseased cells enables detection of mRNA overexpression. </paragraph>

An identical sample of cells or tissues is incubated with a second labeled oligonucleotide which is targeted to the abnormal mRNA, under conditions in which specific hybridization can occur, and the sample is washed to remove unbound oligonucleotide. Label remaining in the sample indicates bound oligonucleotide and can be quantitated using a scintillation counter, fluorimeter, or other routine means. The presence of abnormal mRNA is indicated if binding is observed in the case of the second but not the first sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Double labeling can also be used with the oligonucleotides and methods of the invention to specifically detect expression of abnormal mRNA. A single tissue sample is incubated with a first <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled oligonucleotide which is targeted to wild-type mRNA, and a second fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide which is targeted to the abnormal mRNA, under conditions in which specific hybridization can occur. The sample is washed to remove unbound oligonucleotide and the labels are detected by scintillation counting and fluorimetry. The presence of abnormal mRNA is indicated if the sample does not bind the <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled oligonucleotide (i.e., is not radioactive) but does retain the fluorescent label (i.e., is fluorescent). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> For each oligonucleotide studied, twenty male Balb/c mice (Charles River), weighing about 25 gm, were randomly assigned into one of four treatment groups. Following a one-week acclimation, mice received a single tail vein injection of <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-radiolabeled oligonucleotide (approximately 750 nmoles/kg; ranging from 124-170 &mgr;Ci/kg) administered in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.0. The concentration of oligonucleotide in the dosing solution was approximately 60&mgr;M. One retro-orbital bleed (at either 0.25, 0.5, 2, or 4 hours post-dose) and a terminal bleed (either 1, 3, 8 or 24 hours post-dose) was collected from each group. The terminal bleed was collected by cardiac puncture following ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. An aliquot of each blood sample was reserved for radioactivity determination and the remaining blood was transferred to an EDTA-coated collection tube and centrifuged to obtain plasma. Urine and feces were collected at intervals (0-4, 4-8 and 8-24 hours) from the group terminated at 24 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> At termination, the liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, heart, brain, sample of skeletal muscle, portion of the small intestine, sample of skin, pancreas, bone (both femurs containing marrow) and two lymph nodes were collected from each mouse and weighed. Feces were weighed, then homogenized 1:1 with distilled water using a Brinkmann Polytron homogenizer (Westbury, N.Y.). Plasma, tissues, urine and feces homogenate were divided for the analysis of radioactivity by combustion and for determination of intact oligonucleotide content. All samples were immediately frozen on dry ice after collection and stored at &minus;80&deg; C. until analysis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> Plasma and urine samples were weighed directly into scintillation vials and analyzed directly by liquid scintillation counting after the addition of 15 ml of BetaBlend (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, Calif.). All other samples (tissues, blood and homogenized feces) were weighed into combustion boats and oxidized in a Biological Materials Oxidizer (Model OX-100; R. J. Harvey Instrument Corp., Hillsdale, N.J.). The <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was collected in 20 ml of cocktail, composed of 15 ml of BetaBlend and 5 ml of Harvey Tritium Cocktail (R. J. Harvey Instrument Corp., Hillsdale, N.J.). The combustion efficiency was determined daily by combustion of samples spiked with a solution of <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-mannitol and ranged between 73.9-88.3%. Liquid scintillation counting was performed using a Beckman LS 9800 or LS 6500 Liquid Scintillation System (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, Calif.). Samples were counted for 10 minutes with automatic quench correction. Disintergration per minute values were corrected for the efficiency of the combustion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Analysis of Data </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> Radioactivity in samples was expressed as disintegrations per minute per gram of sample. These values were divided by the specific activity of the radiolabel to express the data in nanomole-equivalents of total oligonucleotide per gram of sample, then converted to percent of dose administered per organ or tissue. Assuming a tissue density of 1 gm/ml, the nmole/gram data were converted to a total &mgr;M concentration. To calculate the concentration of intact oligonucleotide in plasma, liver or kidney at each time point, the mean total &mgr;M concentrations were divided by the percent of intact oligonucleotide in the dosing solution (82-97%), then multiplied by the mean percentage of intact oligonucleotide at each time point as determined by CGE or HPLC. This data was then used for the calculation of tissue half-lives by linear regression and to compare the plasma pharmacokinetics of the different modified oligonucleotides. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using PCNONLIN 4.0 (Statistical Consultants, Inc., Apex, N.C.). After examination of the data, a one-compartment bolus input, first order output model (library model 1) was selected for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> The result of the animal plasma uptake and tissue distribution tests are illustrated graphically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, plasma concentration of each of the test oligonucleotides decrease from the initial injection levels to lower levels over the twenty-four hour test period. Plasma concentrations of the oligonucleotides of the invention were maintained at levels equivalent to those of the non-conjugate bearing phosphorothioate. All of the test compounds were taken up from the plasma to tissues as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The compounds of the invention had different distribution between the various tissues. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the distribution pattern for the control oligonucleotide, identified as ISIS 3082, a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the distribution pattern for a first compound of the invention, an oligonucleotide, identified as ISIS 9045, having a 2&prime;-substituent at each nucleotide. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the distribution pattern for a further compound of the invention, a &ldquo;gap mer&rdquo; oligonucleotide, identified as ISIS 9046, having a 2&prime;-substituent and phosphodiester linkages at each nucleotide at &ldquo;flanking&rdquo; sections of the oligonucleotide and 2&prime;-deoxy, phosphorothioate nucleotides in a central or gap region.  </paragraph>
