<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to performing assays, and particularly to using dual bead structures on a disc. The invention includes methods for preparing assays, methods for performing assays, discs for performing assays, and detection systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention includes methods for determining whether a target agent is present in a biological sample. These methods can include mixing capture beads, each having at least one transport probe, reporter beads, each having at least one signal probe, and a biological sample. These components are mixed under binding conditions that permit formation of a dual bead complex if the target agent is present in the sample. The dual bead complex thus includes a reporter bead and a capture bead each bound to the target agent. The dual bead complex is isolated from the mixture to obtain an isolate. The isolate is then exposed to a capture field on an optical disc. The capture field has a capture agent that binds specifically to the signal probe or transport probe of the dual bead complex. The dual bead complex in the optical disc is then detected to indicate that the target agent is present in the sample, and if desired to indicate a concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The capture beads can have a specified size and have a characteristic that makes them &ldquo;isolatable.&rdquo; The capture beads are preferably magnetic, in which case the isolating of dual bead complex (and some capture beads not part of a complex) in a mixture includes subjecting the mixture to a magnetic field with a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The reporter bead should have characteristics that make it identifiable and distinguishable with detection. The reporter beads can be made of one of a number of materials, such as latex, gold, plastic, steel, or titanium, and should have a known and specified size. The reporter beads can be fluorescent and can be yellow, green, red, or blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The dual bead complex can be formed on the disc itself, or outside the disc and added to the disc. To form the dual bead complex off the disc, methods referred to here as &ldquo;one-step&rdquo; or &ldquo;two-step&rdquo; can be employed. In the two-step method, the mixture initially includes capture beads and the sample. The capture beads are then isolated to wash away unbound sample and leaving bound and unbound capture beads in a first isolate. Reporter beads are then added to the first isolate to produce dual bead complex structures and the isolation process is repeated. The resulting isolate leaves dual bead complex with reporters, but also includes unbound capture beads without reporters. The reporters make the dual bead complex detectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the &ldquo;one-step&rdquo; method, the capture beads, reporter beads and sample are mixed together from the start and then the isolation process isolates dual bead complex along with unbound capture beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These methods for producing and isolating dual bead complex structures can be performed on the disc. The sample and beads can be added to the disc together, or the beads can be pre-loaded on the disc so that only a sample needs to be added. The sample and beads can be added in a mixing chamber on the disc, and the disc can be rotated in one direction or in both to assist the mixing. An isolate can then be created, such as by applying an electromagnet and rotating to cause the material other than the capture beads to be moved to a waste chamber. The isolate is then directed through rotation to capture fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The dual bead complex structures can be detected on the capture field via various methods. In one embodiment, the detecting includes directing a beam of electromagnetic energy from a disc drive toward the capture field and analyzing electromagnetic energy returned from or transmitted past the reporter bead of the dual bead complex attached to the capture field. The disc drive assembly can include a detector and circuitry or software that senses the detector signal for a sufficient transition between light and dark (referred to as an &ldquo;event&rdquo;) to spot a reporter bead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Beads can, alternatively, be detected based on their fluorescence. In this case, the energy source in the disc drive preferably has a wavelength controllable light source and a detector that is or can be made specific to a particular wavelength. Alternatively, a disc drive can be made with a specific light source and detector to produce a dedicated device, in which case the source may only need fine tuning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The biological sample can include blood, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, breast aspirate, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, perintoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, semen, mucus, a hair, feces, a biological particulate suspension, a single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid molecule, a cell, an organ, a tissue, or a tissue extract, or any other sample that includes a target that may be bound through chemical or biological processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition to these medical uses, the embodiments of the present invention can be used in other ways, such as for testing for impurities in a sample, such as food or water, or for otherwise detecting the presence of a material, such as a biological warfare agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The target agent can include, for example, a nucleic acid (such as DNA or RNA) or a protein (such as an antigen or an antibody). If a nucleic acid, both the transport probe and the signal probe can be a nucleic acid molecule complementary to the target nucleic acid. If a protein, both the transport probe and the signal probe can be an antibody that specifically binds the target protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The transport probe or signal probe can bind specifically to the capture agent on the optical disc due to a high affinity between the probe and the capture agent. This high affinity can, for example, be the result of a strong protein-protein affinity (i.e., antigen-antibody affinity), or the result of a complementarity between two nucleic acid molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably the binding is to the signal probe, and then the disc is rotated to move unbound structures, including capture beads not bound to reporter beads, away from the capture field. If the binding is to the transport probe, unbound capture beads will be included, although the reporter beads are still the beads that are detected. This may be acceptable if the detection is for producing a yes/no answer, or if a fine concentration detection is not otherwise required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The transport probe and signal probe can each be one or more probes selected from the group consisting of single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, single-stranded RNA, peptide nucleic acid, biotin, streptavidin, an antigen, an antibody, a receptor protein and a ligand. In a further embodiment, each transport probe comprises double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, wherein the double-stranded DNA is proximate to the capture layer of the optical disc and the single-stranded DNA is distal relative to the capture layer of the optical disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The reporter bead and/or signal probe can be biotinylated and the capture agent can include streptavidin or neutravidin. Chemistry for affixing capture agents to the capture layer of the optical disc are generally known, especially in the case of affixing a protein or nucleic acid to solid surfaces. The capture agent can be affixed to the capture layer via an amino group or a thiol group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The target agent can include a nucleic acid characteristic of a disease, or a nucleotide sequence specific for a person or having a nucleotide sequence specific for an organism, which may be a bacterium, a virus, a mycoplasm, a fungus, a plant, or an animal. The target agent can include a nucleic acid molecule associated with cancer in a human. The target nucleic acid molecule can include a nucleic acid which is at least a portion of a gene selected from the group consisting of: HER2neu, p52, p53, p21 and bcl-2. The target agent can be an antibody which is present only in a subject infected with HIV-1, a viral protein antigen, or a protein characteristic of a disease state in a subject. The methods and apparatus can be used for determining whether a subject is infected by a virus, whether nucleic acid obtained from a subject exhibits a single nucleotide mutation (SNM) relative to corresponding wild-type nucleic acid sequence, or whether a subject expresses a protein of interest, such as a bacterial protein, a fungal protein, a viral protein, an HIV protein, a hepatitis C protein, a hepatitis B protein, or a protein known to be specifically associated with a disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention includes multiplexing methods whereby more than one target agent (e.g., tens, hundreds, or even thousands of different target agents) can be identified on one optical disc. Multiple capture agents can be provided in a single chamber together in capture fields, or separately in separate capture fields. Different reporter beads can be used to be distinguishable from each other, such as beads that fluoresce at different wavelengths or different size reporter beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention includes an optical disc with a substrate, a capture layer over the substrate, and a capture agent bound to the capture layer, such that the capture agent binds to a dual bead complex. Multiple different capture agents can be used for different types of dual bead complexes. The disc can be designed to allow for some dual bead processing on the disc with appropriate chambers and fluidic structures, and can be pre-loaded with reporter and capture beads so that only a sample needs to be added to form the dual bead complex structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the invention includes a disc and disc drive system for performing dual bead assays. The disc drive can include an electromagnet for performing the isolation process, and may include appropriate light source control and detection for the type of reporter beads used. The disc drive can be optical or magneto-optic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> For processing performed on the disc, the drive can include an electromagnet, the disc preferably has a mixing chamber, a waste chamber, and capture area. The sample is mixed with beads in the mixing chamber, a magnetic field is applied over the mixing chamber, and the sample not held by the magnet is directed to the waste chamber so that all magnetic beads, whether bound into a dual bead complex or unbound, remain in the mixing chamber. The magnetic beads are then directed to the capture area. One of a number of different valving arrangements can be used to control the flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect of the present invention, a biodisc is produced for use with biological samples and is used in conjunction with a disc drive, such as a magneto-optical disc drive, that can form magnetic regions on a disc. In a magneto-optical disc and drive, magnetic regions can be formed in a highly controllable and precise manner. These regions can be used to magnetically bind magnetic beads, including unbound magnetic capture beads or including dual bead complexes with magnetic capture beads. The magneto-optical disc drive can write to selected locations on the disc, and then use an optical reader to detect features located at those regions. The regions can be erased, thereby allowing the beads to be released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect, the invention includes a method for use with a biodisc and drive including forming magnetic regions on the biodisc, and providing magnetic beads to the discs so that the beads bind at the magnetic locations. The method preferably further includes detecting at the locations where the magnetic beads bind biological samples, preferably using reporter beads that are detectable, such as by fluorescence or optical event detection. The method can be formed in multiple stages in terms of time or in terms of location through the use of multiple chambers. The regions are written to and a sample is moved over the magnetic regions in order to capture magnetic beads. The regions can then be erased and released if desired. This method allows many different tests to be performed at one time, and can allow a level of interactivity between the user and the disc drives such that additional tests can be created during the testing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The apparatus and methods in embodiments of the present invention can be designed for use by an end-user, inexpensively, without specialized expertise and expensive equipment. The system can be made portable, and thus usable in remote locations where traditional diagnostic equipment may not generally be available. Other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description, drawings, and claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Optical Disc and Drive System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of an optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown for insertion in an optical disc drive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Drive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in conjunction with software in the drive or associated with a separate computer, can cause images, graphs, or output data to be displayed on display monitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As indicated below, there are different types of discs and drives that can be used. The disc drive can be in a unit separate from a controlling computer, or provided in a bay within a computer. The device can be made as portable as a laptop computer, and thus usable with battery power and in remote locations not generally served by advanced diagnostic equipment. The drive is preferably a conventional drive with minimal or no hardware modification, but can be a dedicated biodisc drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use with embodiments of the present invention may have any suitable shape, diameter, or thickness, but preferably is implemented on a round disc with a diameter and a thickness similar to those of a compact disc (CD), a recordable CD (CD-R), CD-RW, a digital versatile disc (DVD), DVD-R, DVD-RW, or other standard optical disc format. The disc may include encoded information, preferably in a known format, for performing, controlling, and post-processing a test or assay, such as information for controlling the rotation rate and direction of the disc, timing for rotation, stopping and starting, delay periods, locations of samples, position of the light source, and power of the light source. Such encoded information is referred to generally here as operational information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The disc may be referred to as reflective, transmissive, or some combination of reflective and transmissive. In a reflective disc, an incident light beam is focused onto the disc (typically at a reflective surface where information is encoded), reflected, and returned through optical elements to a detector on the same side of the disc as the light source. In a transmissive disc, light passes through the disc (or portions thereof) to a detector on the other side of the disc from the light source. In a transmissive portion of a disc, some light may also be reflected and detected as reflected light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C, a reflective disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown with a cap <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a channel layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Cap <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has inlet ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for receiving samples and vent ports <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Cap <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be formed primarily from polycarbonate, and may be coated with a reflective layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> on the bottom thereof. Reflective layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is preferably made from a metal, such as aluminum or gold, and is used to encode the operational information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Channel layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> defines fluidic circuits <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> by having desired shapes cut out from channel layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Each fluidic circuit <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> preferably has a flow channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a return vent channel <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and some have a mixing chamber <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. A mixing chamber <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> can be symmetrically formed relative to the flow channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, while an off-set mixing chamber <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is formed to one side of the flow channel <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Fluidic circuits <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are rather simple in construction, but a fluidic circuit can include other channels and chambers, such as preparatory regions or a waste region, as shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,581, which is incorporated herein by reference, and can include valves and other fluid control structures. Channel layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can include adhesives for bonding to the substrate and to the cap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has polycarbonate layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and has target zones <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> formed as openings in a reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> deposited on the top of layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Target zones <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be formed by removing portions of reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> in any desired shape, or by masking target zone areas before applying reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from a metal, such as aluminum or gold, and can be configured with the rest of the substrate to encode operational information that is read with incident light, such as through a wobble groove or through an arrangement of pits. Light incident from under substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thus is reflected by layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, except at target zones <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, where it is reflected by layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Target zones are where investigational features are detected. If the target zone is a location where an antibody, strand of DNA, or other material that can bind to a target is located, the target zone can be referred to as a capture zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, optical disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is cut away to illustrate a partial cross-sectional view. An active capture layer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is formed over reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Capture layer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may generally be formed from nitrocellulose, polystyrene, polycarbonate, gold, activated glass, modified glass, or a modified polystyrene, for example, polystyrene-co-maleic anhydride. Channel layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is over capture layer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Trigger marks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are preferably included on the surface of a reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, and may include a clear window in all three layers of the disc, an opaque area, or a reflective or semi-reflective area encoded with information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In operation, samples can be introduced through inlet ports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of cap <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. When rotated, the sample moves outwardly from inlet port <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> along capture layer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Through one of a number of biological or chemical reactions or processes, detectable features, referred to as investigational features, may be present in the target zones. Examples of such processes are shown in the incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,581. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The investigational features captured by the capture layer with a capture agent may be designed to be located in the focal plane coplanar with reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, where an incident beam is typically focused in conventional readers; alternatively, the investigational features may be captured in a plane spaced from the focal plane. The former configuration is referred to as a &ldquo;proximal&rdquo; type disc, and the latter a &ldquo;distal&rdquo; type disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, a transmissive optical disc <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has a cap <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, a channel layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and a substrate <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Cap <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes inlet ports <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and vent ports <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and is preferably formed mainly from polycarbonate. Trigger marks <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, similar to those for reflective disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, may be included. Channel layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has fluidic circuits <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, which can have structure and use similar to those described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C. Substrate <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> may include target zones <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, and preferably includes a polycarbonate layer <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. Substrate <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> may, but need not, have a thin semi-reflective layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> deposited on top of layer <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. Semi-reflective layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is preferably significantly thinner than reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> on substrate <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of reflective disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C). Semi-reflective layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from a metal, such as aluminum or gold, but is sufficiently thin to allow a portion of an incident light beam to penetrate and pass through layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, while some of the incident light is reflected back. A gold film layer, for example, is 95% reflective at a thickness greater than about 700 &angst;, while the transmission of light through the gold film is about 50% transmissive at approximately 100 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> is a cut-away perspective view of transmissive disc <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The semi-reflective nature of layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> makes its entire surface potentially available for target zones, including virtual zones defined by trigger marks or encoded data patterns on the disc. Target zones <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may also be formed by marking the designated area in the indicated shape or alternatively in any desired shape. Markings to indicate target zone <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be made on seme-reflective layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> or on a bottom portion of substrate <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (under the disc). Target zones <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be created by silk screening ink onto semi-reflective layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> An active capture layer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is applied over semi-reflective layer <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Capture layer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may be formed from the same materials as described above in conjunction with layer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>) and serves substantially the same purpose when a sample is provided through an opening in disc <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the disc is rotated. In transmissive disc <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, there is no reflective layer comparable to reflective layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in reflective disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an optical disc reader system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. This system may be a conventional reader for CD, CD-R, DVD, or other known comparable format, a modified version of such a drive, or a completely distinct dedicated device. The basic components are a motor for rotating the disc, a light system for providing light, and a detection system for detecting light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A light source <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> provides light to optical components <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to produce an incident light beam <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In the case of reflective disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a return beam <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is reflected from either reflective surface <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Return beam <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is provided back to optical components <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and then to a bottom detector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. For transmissive disc <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a transmitted beam <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is detected by a top detector <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Optical components <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> can include a lens, a beam splitter, and a quarter wave plate that changes the polarization of the light beam so that the beam splitter directs a reflected beam through the lens to focus the reflected beam onto the detector. An astigmatic element, such as a cylindrical lens, may be provided between the beam splitter and detector to introduce astigmatism in the reflected light beam. The light source can be controllable for wavelength and power in response to data introduced by the user or read from the disc. This control is especially useful if it is desired to detect multiple different structures that fluoresce at different wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Data from detector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and/or detector <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is provided to a computer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> including a processor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and an analyzer <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. An image or output results can then be provided to a monitor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. Computer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can represent a desktop computer, programmable logic, or some other processing device, and also can include a connection (such as over the Internet) to other processing and/or storage devices. A drive motor <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and a controller <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> are provided for controlling the rotation and direction of disc <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and the computer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> with processor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be in communication or can be the same computer. Methods and systems for reading such a disc are also shown in Gordon, U.S. Pat. No. 5,892,577, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The detector can be designed to detect all light that reaches the detector, or though its design or an external filter, light only at specific wavelengths. By making the detector controllable in terms of the detectable wavelength, beads or other structures that fluoresce at different wavelengths can be separately detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A hardware trigger sensor <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may be used with either a reflective or transmissive disc. Triggering sensor <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> provides a signal to computer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> (or to some other electronics) to allow for the collection of data by processor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> only when incident beam <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is on a target zone. Alternatively, software read from a disc can be used to control data collection by processor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> independent of any physical marks on the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The substrate layer may be impressed with a spiral track that starts at an innermost readable portion of the disc and then spirals out to an outermost readable portion of the disc. In a non-recordable CD, this track is made up of a series of embossed pits with varying length, each typically having a depth of approximately one-quarter the wavelength of the light that is used to read the disc. The varying lengths and spacing between the pits encode the operational data. The spiral groove of a recordable CD-like disc has a detectable dye rather than pits. This is where the operation information, such as the rotation rate, is recorded. Depending on the test, assay, or investigational protocol, the rotation rate may be variable with intervening or consecutive periods of acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration. These periods may be closely controlled both as to speed and time of rotation to provide, for example, mixing, agitation, or separation of fluids and suspensions with agents, reagents, antibodies, or other materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Numerous designs and configurations of an optical pickup and associated electronics may be used in the context of the embodiments of the present invention. Further details and alternative designs for compact discs and readers are described in <highlight><italic>Compact Disc Technology</italic></highlight>, by Nakajima and Ogawa, IOS Press, Inc. (1992); <highlight><italic>The Compact Disc Handbook, Digital Audio and Compact Disc Technology</italic></highlight>, by Baert et al. (eds.), Books Britain (1995); and <highlight><italic>CD</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Rom Professional&apos;s CD</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Recordable Handbook: The Complete Guide to Practical Desktop CD</italic></highlight>, Starrett et al. (eds.), ISBN:0910965188 (1996); all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The disc drive assembly is thus employed to rotate the disc, read and process any encoded operational information stored on the disc, analyze the liquid, chemical, biological, or biochemical investigational features in an assay region of the disc, to write information to the disc either before or after the material in the assay zone is analyzed by the read beam of the drive or deliver the information via various possible interfaces, such as Ethernet to a user, database, or anywhere the information could be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> are partial cross sectional views of embodiments of reflective discs that can be used according to the present invention. In each case, there is a substrate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and a reflective layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>. An capture layer <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is over the reflective layer. A capture field <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is formed by removing an area or portion of the reflective layer at a desired location or, alternatively, by masking the desired area prior to applying the reflective layer. A plastic adhesive member <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with cut-out shapes to define channels is applied over the capture layer. A cap portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with a second reflective layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is applied over adhesive member <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> to form a flow channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In each case, the incident light is at <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the reflected light is at <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Substrate <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> includes a series of wobble grooves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, which are typical part of a CD-R disc. Grooves <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are in the form of a spiral extending from near the center of the disc toward the outer edge, and are implemented so that an incident beam can track long the spiral. The spiral groove in a CD-R disc contains a dye, rather than pits and lands which are typically employed in a prerecorded CD. The reflective layer applied over the grooves in this embodiment is, as illustrated, conformal in nature. The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, by contrast, does not include a wobble groove, and thus is more similar to a CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Dual Bead Complex </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show a capture bead <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, a reporter bead <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, and the formation of a dual bead complex <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Capture bead <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can be used in conjunction with a variety of different assays including biological assays such as immunoassays, molecular assays, and more specifically genetic assays. In the case of immunoassays, transport probes <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> are conjugated onto the beads. Transport probes <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> would include proteins, such as antigens or antibodies, implemented to capture protein targets. In the case of molecular assays, the transport probe would include nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA implemented to capture genetic targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A target agent <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, shown here as target DNA or RNA from a test sample, is added to a capture bead <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> coated with transport probes <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. In this implementation, transport probes <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> are formed from desired nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Capture bead <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> has a characteristic that allows it to be isolated from a material suspension or solution. The capture bead may be selected based upon a desired size, and a preferred way to make it isolatable is for it to be magnetic. </paragraph>

The dual bead assay is injected into flow channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through inlet port <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. As flow channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is further filled with the dual bead assay from pipette <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, the dual bead complex <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> begins to move down flow channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> as the disc is rotated. The loading chamber <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can include a break-away retaining wall <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> so that complex <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> moves down the flow channel at one time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, binding agents on reporter beads <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> bind to the affinity agents <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In this manner, reporter beads <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> are retained within capture fields <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> via BSA-biotin/Streptavidin interactions. Binding can be further facilitated by rotating the disc so that the dual bead complex <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> can slowly move or tumble down the flow channel.

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Summary of Dual Bead Assays for Target Nucleic Acids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In one specific embodiment of the present invention, the target molecules are nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA and chemical analogs thereof) and the dual bead assay employs approximately 3 micron magnetic capture beads and approximately 2.1 micron fluorescent reporter beads. These beads are coated with transport probes and signal probes respectively. The transport probes and signal probes are complementary to the target sequence but not to each other. The capture beads are mixed with varying quantities of target nucleic acid. Unbound target nucleic acid is removed from the solution by magnetic concentration of the magnetic beads. Fluorescent reporter beads are then allowed to bind to the captured target DNA. Unbound reporter beads are removed by magnetic concentration of the magnetic beads. Thus, the magnetic capture beads bind to fluorescent reporter beads, only in the presence of the target sequence, resulting in a dual bead assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The transport probes and signal probes are covalently conjugated onto carboxylated capture beads and reporter beads via EDC conjugation. Attaching double stranded probes to the beads prior to conjugation reduces the non-covalent attachment of probes to beads significantly. By using appropriate bead type and conjugation conditions, the covalent conjugation efficiency could be as high as 95%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The use of magnetic beads in the capture of target nucleic acid speeds up the washing steps and facilitates the separation steps between bound and unbound target sequences or antigens/antibodies significantly. Furthermore, when the target concentration is limiting, each target agent will hybridize to one reporter bead. One target agent is not detectable by any existing technologies. In the dual bead assay, detection of the target is assisted by the use of approximately 2.1 micron reporter beads. Reporter beads can be easily detected and quantified by various methods. Therefore, the dual bead assay increases the sensitivity of the target capture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Different methods can be employed for immobilizing capture reagents in the capture field. One method includes using BSA-biotin molecules to capture streptavidin or neutravidin coated reporter beads. A second method includes using a nucleic acid sequence complementary to the signal probes to capture the reporter beads. In the first method, the disc surface is coated with a layer of polystyrene, and then BSA-biotin are spotted onto capture fields located on the disc. In the second method, the capturing sequence is modified at the end with an amino group, and the disc surface is coated with maleic anhydride polystyrene. The amino group on the probe binds covalently to the maleic anhydride, thereby attaching the nucleic acid transport probe to the disc in the capture field. Unbound capture reagents are washed off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> After this binding, the channel is formed by affixing the adhesive layer and a cover or cap layer (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The dual bead assay suspension is then loaded into the channels via the port such that the whole channel is filled with the sample. The ports are sealed and the disc is rotated in the optical disc drive. The reporter beads (with or without the attaching magnetic capture beads) can be captured within the capture field. During spinning, free magnetic capture beads will be spun off to the bottom of the channel. Alternatively, all magnetic capture beads can be spun off to the bottom of the channel, and only the reporter beads remain bound to the capturing field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Detection </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The number of reporter beads bound in the capture field can be detected in a yes/no manner, and/or can be quantified by the optical disc drive/reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The test results of any of the test methods described above can be readily displayed on monitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The disc according to the present invention preferably includes encoded software that is read to control the controller, the processor, and the analyzer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This interactive software is implemented to facilitate the methods described herein and the display of results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Referring to the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference>, a number of traces can be made with the incident beam to produce two different signatures. These graphs represent detected reflected light. As shown, the signatures for a 2.1 micron reporter bead <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> are sufficiently different from those for a 3 micron capture bead <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> such that the two different types of beads can be detected and discriminated. A sufficient change in detected light is referred to as an event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</cross-reference> show scan lines and graphs indicating the detection of a reporter bead <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and a capture bead <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> bound together into an oblong shape of a dual bead complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, other detection methods can be used. For example, reporter beads can be used that fluoresce at a known wavelength. The disc drive is set at the desired wavelength or is controllable to provide light at that wavelength. The bead then emits light at a different wavelength. The emitted light can be detected by a detector that is dedicated to that wavelength or is controllable to detect that wavelength, e.g., though the use of filtering prior to the detector. The wavelength that is used for the light source and the emitted light can be encoded on the disc or provided by the user. The user need not know specifically the wavelength, but a user interface can allow a user to select from among different types of tests, thereby reducing the need for technical knowledge by the user. Detection methods are described, for example, in an application entitled &ldquo;Disc Drive System and Methods for Use with Bio-Discs&rdquo; filed Nov. 9, 2001, as Ser. No. 09/______, which is expressly incorporated by reference; and also Provisional Application Nos. 60/270,095 filed Feb. 20, 2001 and 60/292,108, filed May 18, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Sensitivity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20, a</cross-reference> graph showing mole concentration versus number of detected beads shows that even at 10E-16 Molar (moles/liter) a sufficient number of beads over zero concentration can be detected to sense the presence of the target. While the particular graph shown was generated using data from a fluorimeter, the results should be the same for an optical disc drive, which can be used as a fluorimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> With a sensitivity of 10E-16 Molar, a dual bead assay represents a very sensitive detection method for DNA that does not require DNA amplification (such as through PCR) and can be used to detect even a single bead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Multiplexing Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The use of a dual bead assay in the capture of targets allows for the use of multiplexing assays. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, by combining different sizes of magnetic beads and different types and sizes of reporter beads, different target agents can be detected simultaneously. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, four sizes of magnetic capture beads, and four sizes of three types of reporter beads produce up to 48 different types of dual bead complex. In a multiplexing assay, probes specific to different targets are thus conjugated to capture beads and reporter beads having different physical and/or optical properties, such as fluorescence at different wavelengths, to allow for the detection of different target agents simultaneously from the same biological sample in the same assay. As indicated above, small differences in size can be detected by detecting reflected or transmitted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Multiple dual bead complex structures to capture different target agents can be carried out on or off the disc. If off the disc, the dual bead suspension is loaded into a port on the disc. The port is sealed and the disc is rotated in the disc reader. During spinning, free (unbound) beads are spun off to a periphery of the disc. The reporter beads detecting various target agents are thus localized in capture fields. In this manner, the presence of a specific target agent can be detected, and the amount of a specific target agent can be quantified by the disc reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> graph (generated with data from a fluorimeter) demonstrates the detection of two targets and shows that for different concentrations of target in a solution, large numbers of beads can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Creation of Dual Bead Complex on the Disc </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The exemplary methods of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> are for preparation of dual bead complexes outside of the disc for later injection into the disc as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the dual bead complex can be formed in whole on the disc with just a sample injected, or in part with the sample and some beads injected. In one embodiment, the beads and sample are added to the disc at the same time, or nearly the same time. Alternatively, the beads with the probes can be pre-loaded on the disc for future use with a sample so that only a sample needs to be added. This latter embodiment should produce the easiest to operate version of a dual bead complex disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The beads would typically have a long shelf life, with less shelf life for the probes. The probes can be dried or lyophilized (freeze dried) to extend the period during which the probes can remain in the disc. With the probes dried, the sample essentially reconstitutes the probes and then mixes with the beads to produce dual bead complex structures can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In either case, the basic process for on disc processing includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> (1) inserting the sample into a disc with beads with probes; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> (2) causing the sample and the beads to mix on the disc; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> (3) isolating, such as by applying a magnetic field, to hold the dual bead complex and move the non-held beads away, such as to a region referred to here as a waste chamber; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> (4) directing the dual bead complexes (and any other material not moved to the waste chamber) to the capture fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The detection process can be the same as one of those described above, such as by event detection or fluorimetry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21, a</cross-reference> general representation of a disc according to this aspect of the present invention and a method corresponding generally to the one-step method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is shown. The sample and beads can be added at one time or successively but closely in time, or the beads can be pre-loaded into a portion of the disc. These materials can be provided to a mixing chamber <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> that can have a breakaway wall (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference>) or an exit port <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> that has capillary forces that hold in the mixture. Mixing the sample and beads on the disc would be accomplished through rotation at a rate insufficient to cause the wall to break or the capillary forces to be overcome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The disc can be rotated in one direction, or it can be rotated alternately in opposite directions to agitate the material in a mixing chamber. The mixing chamber is preferably sufficiently large so that circulation and mixing is possible. The mixing can be continuous or intermittent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Next, in the case of the capture beads being magnetic, a magnetic field from a source <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> can be applied over mixing chamber <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to hold the dual bead complexes and unbound magnetic beads in place while material without magnetic beads is allowed to flow away to a waste chamber <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> or to be trapped in a side area of the disc. At this stage, only magnetic capture beads, unbound or as part of a dual bead complex, remain. The magnetic field is released, and the dual bead complex with the magnetic beads is directed to capture and detection chamber <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The process of directing non-magnetic beads to waste chamber <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and then magnetic beads to detection chamber <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can be accomplished through the microfluidic construction and/or fluidic components. A valve <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> or some other directing arrangement can be used to direct the sample and non-magnetic beads to waste chamber <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and then to detection chamber <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. A number of embodiments for rotationally dependent flow can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference> shows one embodiment of a rotationally directionally dependent valve arrangement that is directionally dependent and uses a movable component for a valve. The mixing chamber leads to an intermediate chamber <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> that has a movable component, such as a ball <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. In the non-rotated state, the ball may be kept in a slight recessed portion, or chamber <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> may have a gradual V-shaped tapering in the circumferential direction to keep the ball centered when there is no rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22B and 22C</cross-reference> in addition to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference>A, when the disc is rotated clockwise (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</cross-reference>), ball <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> moves to a valve seat <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> to block passage to detection chamber <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and to allow flow to waste chamber <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. When the disc is rotated counter-clockwise (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</cross-reference>), ball <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> moves to a valve seat <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to block a passage to waste chamber <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and to allow flow to detection chamber <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>C show a variation of the prior embodiment in which the ball is replaced by a wedge <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> that moves one way or the other in response to acceleration of the disc. The wedge can have a circular outer shape that conforms to the shape of an intermediate chamber <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>. The wedge is preferably made of a heavy dense material relative to chamber <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to avoid sticking. A coating can be used to promote sliding of the wedge relative to the chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> When the disc is initially rotated clockwise (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</cross-reference>), the angular acceleration causes wedge <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> to move to block a passage to detection chamber <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and to allow flow to waste chamber <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. When the disc is initially rotated counter-clockwise (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</cross-reference>), the angular acceleration causes wedge <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> moves to block a passage to waste chamber <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and allow flow to detection chamber <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. During constant rotation after the acceleration, wedge <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> remains in place blocking the appropriate passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C show another embodiment, demonstrating that control over the flow can be performed without moving parts but through the configuration of passages. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24, a</cross-reference> disc <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> has a mixing chamber <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, a waste chamber <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, and a detection chamber <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>. An annular electromagnet <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is positioned over disc <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> and has a radius such that as disc <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> rotates, electromagnet <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> remains over mixing chamber <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, and is radially spaced from chambers <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C, in the non-rotated state (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</cross-reference>), a mixing chamber <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> shaped as an annular sector holds a sample with dual bead complexes <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and various unbound magnetic capture beads and reporter beads <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. The electromagnet is turned on and the disc is rotated counter-clockwise (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</cross-reference>), or it can be agitated at a lower rpm, such as 1&times; or 3&times;. Dual bead complexes <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> remain in mixing chamber <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> while the liquid sample moves in response to angular acceleration to a rotationally trailing end of mixing chamber <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. The disc is rotated with sufficient speed to overcome capillary forces to allow the non-held part of the sample to move through a passage <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> to waste chamber <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Next, the magnet is turned off and the disc is rotated counter-clockwise (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</cross-reference>). Dual bead complexes <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and other magnetic beads move to now-trailing end <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> in response to angular acceleration and then through a passage <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> to detection chamber <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>. The liquid cannot move down passage <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> at this stage because of the configuration. This embodiment thus illustrates directionally dependent flow as well as rotational speed dependent flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment and others in which a fluidic circuit is formed in a region of the disc, plurality of regions can be formed and distributed about the disc, for example, in a regular manner to promote balance. Furthermore, as discussed above, instructions for controlling the rotation can be provided on the disc. Accordingly, by reading the disc, the disc drive can have instructions to rotate for a particular period of time at a particular speed, stop for some period of time, and rotate in the opposite direction for another period of time. In addition, the encoded information can include directions such as the power and wavelength of the light source, particularly if fluorescence is used, and other such parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments for controlling flow can be used, in some cases by using the electromagnet, and in some cases by using movable parts (in addition to the disc itself, such as a ball or wedge) or without additional movable parts. Capillary forces can be used to make the flow tend to go to the detection chamber unless the passage to the detection chamber is blocked and the material is thus directed to the waste chamber. This blockage can occur in response to the magnetic field, such as with a ball or movable wall that moves across the passage that leads to the detection chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, a passage can have a material or configuration that can seal or dissolve either under influence from a laser in a disc drive, or a catalyst provided onto the disc, such as in the sample. For example, a gel may solidify in the presence of a material over time, in which case the time to close can be set sufficiently long to allow the unbound capture beads to flow to a waste chamber before the passage to the waste chamber closes. Alternatively, the passage to the waste chamber can be open while the passage to the detection chamber is closed. After the unbound beads are directed to the waste chamber, the passage to the direction chamber is opened by energy introduced from the laser to allow flow to the detection chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, another embodiment of a disc <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> for use with dual bead complexes is shown. In this case, a disc, such as one used with a magneto-optical drive, has regions that can be written and erased with a magnetic head and read with an optical reader. A magneto-optical disc drive, for example, can write in regions as small as 1 micron by 1 micron square, shown as squares <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>. As indicated in the close-up section, magnetic field lines are shown with respect to adjacent regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The ability to write to small areas in a highly controllable manner to make them magnetic allows capture areas to be created in desired locations. These magnetic capture areas can be formed in any desired configuration or location in one chamber or in multiple chambers. These areas capture and hold magnetic beads when applied over the disc. The domains can be erased if desired, thereby allowing them to be made non-magnetic and allowing the beads to be released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In one configuration, a set of three radially oriented columns <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> are shown with no beads attached to the squares in the columns. A set of four columns <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> is shown with individual magnetic beads magnetically attached to the squares in the columns. A set of four columns <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> is shown with dual bead complexes attached to the squares in the columns, with different columns having different sets of magnetic beads (note that some beads are larger than others). Final column <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> is shown with different dual bead complexes attached at different squares. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In a method for use with such a disc, the write head can be used to create magnetic squares, and then the sample can be flowed over that area to capture magnetic beads in the sample. Then an area with a new set of squares can be made magnetic and the sample provided to that area to bind to the disc at the squares. If desired, the regions can be erased, thereby making them non-magnetic and allowing captured beads to be released. Thus this system allows one or more highly controllable capture areas to be created. The spaced apart squares can also make detection easier because of the spacing and the known locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> As described above, a sample can be provided to a chamber on a disc, but naturally a sample could be provided to multiple chambers that have sets of beads different from each other. Alternatively, a series of chambers can be created such that a sample can be moved through rotational motion from one chamber to the next, and different tests can then be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> With such a disc, a large number of tests can be performed at one time and can be performed interactively, such that when a test is performed and a result is obtained, the system can be instructed to create a new set of magnetic regions for capturing the dual bead complex. Regions can be created one at a time or in large groups, and can be performed in successive chambers that have different pre-loaded beads. Other processing advantages can be obtained with a disc that has writable magnetic regions. For example, the &ldquo;capture agent&rdquo; is essentially the magnetic field created by the region on the disc and therefore there is no need to add an additional capture agent. By using rotation, the amount of buffering and washing can be reduced or possibly even eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Instructions for controlling the locations for regions written or erased on the disc, and other information such as rotational speeds, stages of rotation, waiting periods, wavelength of the light source, and other parameters can be encoded on and then read from the disc itself. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in detail with reference to certain examples and further illustrations of the invention are in the experimental details section which follows, it should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the precise examples. Rather, in view of the present disclosure, many modifications and variations would present themselves to those of skill in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. The examples provided are set forth to aid in an understanding of the invention but are not intended to, and should not be construed to, limit in any way the invention as set forth. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> 1. Dual Bead Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In this example, the dual bead assay is carried out to detect the gene sequence DYS that is present in male but not female. The assay is comprised of 3 micron magnetic capture beads (Spherotech, Libertyville, Ill.) coated with covalently attached capture probes (Biosource, Calif.); 2.1 micron fluorescent reporter beads (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) coated with a covalently attached sequence (Biosource, Calif.) specific for the DYS gene, and target DNA molecules containing DYS sequences. The target DNA is a synthetic <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> oligonucleotide sequence. The capture probes and reporter probes are 40 nucleotides in length and are complementary to the DYS sequence but not to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The specific methodology employed to prepare the assay involved treating 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>capture beads and 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>reporter beads in 100 microgram per milliliter salmon sperm DNA for 1 hour at room temperature. This pretreatment will reduce the non-specific binding between the capture and reporter beads in the absence of target DNA. The capture beads were concentrated magnetically with the supernatant being removed. 100 microliters of the hybridization buffer (0.2M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 5&times;Denhart&apos;s mix, 10 microgram per milliliter denatured salmon sperm DNA) were added and the beads were resuspended. Various concentration of target DNA ranging from 1, 10, 100 and 1000 femtomoles were added to the capture bead suspensions. The suspension was incubated while mixing at 37 degrees Celsius for 2 hours. The beads were magnetically concentrated and the supernatant containing unbound target DNA was removed. One hundred microliters of wash buffer (145 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Tween, 0.25% NFDM (Non Fat Dried Milk), 10 mM EDTA) was added and the beads were resuspended. The beads were magnetically concentrated and the supernatant was again removed. The wash procedure was repeated two times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>reporter beads in 100 microliter hybridization buffer (0.2M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 5&times;Denhart&apos;s mix, 10 microgram per milliliter denatured salmon sperm DNA) were then added to washed capture beads. The beads were resuspended and incubated while mixing at 37 degrees Centigrade for an additional 2 hours. After incubation, the capture beads were concentrated magnetically, and the supernatant containing unbound reporter beads were removed. One hundred microliters of wash buffer (145 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Tween, 0.25% NFDM (Non Fat Dried Milk), 10 mM EDTA) was added and the beads were resuspended. The beads were magnetically concentrated and the supernatant was again removed. The wash procedure was repeated two times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in 20 microliters of binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.05% T-20, 1% BSA). 10 microliters was loading onto the disc that was prepared as described in 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> 2. Preparation of the Disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> A gold disc was coated with maleic anhydride polystyrene. An amine DNA sequence complementary to the reporter probes (or capture agent) was immobilized onto discrete reaction zones on the disc. Prior to sample injection, the channels were blocked with a blocking buffer (50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.05% T-20, 1% BSA, 1% sucrose) to prevent non-specific binding of the dual bead complex to the disc surface. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> 1. Dual Bead Assay Multiplexing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In this example, the dual bead assay is carried out to detect 2 DNA targets simultaneously. The assay is comprised of 3 micron magnetic capture beads (Spherotech, Libertyville, Ill.). One population of the magnetic capture bead is coated with capture probes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which are complementary to the DNA target <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, another population of the magnetic capture beads is coated with capture probes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which are complementary to the DNA target <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, 2 different types of magnetic capture beads may be used. There are two distinct types of reporter beads in the assay. The two types may differ by chemical composition (for example silica and polystyrene) and/or by size. One type of reporter beads is coated with reporter probes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which are complementary to the DNA target <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The other reporter beads are coated with reporter probes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which are complementary to the DNA target <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Again, the capture probes and reporter probes are complementary to the respective targets but not to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The specific methodology employed to prepare the dual bead assay multiplexing involved treating 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>capture beads and 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>reporter beads in 100 microgram per milliliter salmon sperm DNA for 1 hour at room temperature. This pretreatment will reduce the non-specific binding between the capture and reporter beads in the absence of targets DNA. The capture beads were concentrated magnetically with the supernatant being removed. <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> microliters of the hybridization buffer (0.2M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 5&times;Denhart&apos;s mix, 10 microgram per milliliter denatured salmon sperm DNA) were added and the beads were resuspended. Various concentration of target DNA ranging from 1, 10, 100 and 1000 femtomoles were added to the capture bead suspensions. The suspension was incubated while mixing at 37 degrees Centigrade for 2 hours. The beads were magnetically concentrated and the supernatant containing unbound target DNA was removed. One hundred microliters of wash buffer (145 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Tween, 0.25% NFDM (Non Fat Dried Milk), 10 mM EDTA) was added and the beads were resuspended. The beads were magnetically concentrated and the supernatant was again removed. The wash procedure was repeated two times. </paragraph>

The beads were resuspended and incubated while mixing at 37 degrees Centigrade for an additional 2 hours. After incubation, the capture beads were concentrated magnetically, and the supernatant containing unbound reporter beads were removed. One hundred microliters of wash buffer (145 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Tween, 0.25% NFDM (Non Fat Dried Milk), 10 mM EDTA) was added and the beads were resuspended. The beads were magnetically concentrated and the supernatant was again removed. The wash procedure was repeated two times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in 20 microliters of binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.05% T-20, 1% BSA). 10 microliters was loading onto the disc that was prepared as described in 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> 2. Preparation of the Disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> A gold disc was coated with maleic anhydride polystyrene as described previously. Distinct reaction zones were created for the 2 types of reporter beads. Each reaction zone consisted of amine DNA sequences complementary to the respective reporter probes (or capture agent). Prior to sample injection, the channels were blocked with a blocking buffer (50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.05% T-20, 1% BSA, 1% sucrose) to prevent non-specific binding of the dual bead complex to the disc surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> 3. Capture of dual bead complex structures on the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> 10 microliters of the dual bead mixture prepared as described in part 1 was loaded into the disc chamber. The injection ports were sealed. To facilitate hybridization between the reporter probes on the reporter beads and the capture agents, the disc was centrifuged at low speed (less than 800 rpm) up to 15 minutes. The disc was read in the CD-reader at the speed 4&times;(&tilde;1600 rpm) for 5 minutes. Under these conditions, the unbound magnetic capture beads were centrifuged to the bottom of the channels. The reporter beads bound to the capture zone via hybridization between the reporter probes and their complementary capture agent. </paragraph>
