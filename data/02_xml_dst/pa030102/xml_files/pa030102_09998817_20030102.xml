<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to humanized monoclonal antibodies and fragments or derivatives thereof which specifically bind tumor-associated glycoprotein TAG-72, a human pancarcinoma antigen expressed by various human tumor cells. More specifically, the present invention relates to humanized monoclonal antibodies and fragments or derivatives thereof derived from murine monoclonal antibody CC49 or other murine antibodies which specifically bind TAG-72. The present invention further relates to methods for producing such humanized monoclonal antibodies specific to TAG-72, pharmaceutical and diagnostic compositions containing such humanized monoclonal antibodies, and methods of use thereof for the treatment or diagnosis of cancer. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The identification of antigens expressed by tumor cells and the preparation of monoclonal antibodies which specifically bind such antigens is well known in the art. Anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies exhibit potential application as both therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Such monoclonal antibodies have potential application as diagnostic agents because they specifically bind tumor antigens and thereby can detect the presence of tumor cells or tumor antigen in an analyte. For example, use of monoclonal antibodies which bind tumor antigens for in vitro and in vivo imaging of tumor cells or tumors using a labeled form of such a monoclonal antibody is conventional in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, monoclonal antibodies which bind tumor antigens have well known application as therapeutic agents. The usage of monoclonal antibodies themselves as therapeutic agents, or as conjugates wherein the monoclonal antibody is directly or indirectly attached to an effector moiety, e.g., a drug, cytokine, cytotoxin, etc., is well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Essentially, if the monoclonal antibody is attached to an effector moiety the monoclonal antibody functions as a targeting moiety, i.e. it directs the desired effector moiety (which typically possesses therapeutic activity) against a desired target, e.g., a tumor which expresses the antigen bound by the monoclonal antibody. In contrast, when the monoclonal antibody itself operates as a therapeutic agent, the antibody functions both as a targeting moiety&mdash;i.e., it will specifically bind a cell which expresses the antigen&mdash;and as an effector which mediates therapeutic activity, typically tumor cell Iysis. Such effector functions&mdash;including, e.g., antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), among others&mdash;are effected by the portion of the antibody molecule generally referred to in the literature as the Fc portion. One specific tumor antigen against which various monoclonal antibodies have been developed is tumor-associated glycoprotein TAG-72. TAG-72 is expressed on the surface of various human tumor cells, such as the LS174T tumor cell line (American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC) No. CL188, a variant of cell line LS180 (ATCC No. CL187)), a colon adenocarcinoma line. Various research groups have reported the production of monoclonal antibodies to TAG-72. See, e.g., Muraro et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>48:4588-4596 (1988); Johnson et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>46:850-857 (1986); Molinolo et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>50:1291-1298 (1990); Thor et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>46:3118-3127 (1986); EP 394,277 to Schlom et al. (assigned to the National Cancer Institute); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,443 to Jeffrey Schlom et al. Specific antibodies to TAG-72 which are publicly available include CC49 (ATCC No. HB 9459), CC83 (ATCC No. HB 9453), CC46 (ATCC No. HB 9458), CC92 (ATCC No. HB 9454), CC30 (ATCC No. HB 9457), CC11 (ATCC No. 9455), and CC15 (ATCC No. HB 9460). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One example thereof, CC49, is a murine monoclonal antibody of the IgG<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>isotype. This monoclonal antibody is a second generation monoclonal antibody prepared by immunizing mice with TAG-72 purified using the first generation antibody B72.3. Colcher et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>78:3199-3203 (1981). CC49 specifically binds TAG-72, and has a higher antigen-binding affinity than B72.3. Muraro et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>48:4588-4596 (1988). This monoclonal antibody has been reported to target human colon carcinoma xenografts efficiently, and to reduce the growth of such xenografts with good efficacy. Molinolo et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>50:1291-1298 (1996); Colcher et al., <highlight><italic>J. Natl. Cancer Inst., </italic></highlight>82:1191-1197 (1990). Also, radiolabeled CC49 has been reported to exhibit excellent tumor localization in several ongoing clinical trials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, while murine antibodies have applicability as therapeutic agents in humans, they are disadvantageous in some respects. Specifically, murine antibodies, because of the fact that they are of foreign species origin, may be immunogenic in humans. This may result in a neutralizing antibody response (human anti-murine antibody (HAMA) response), which is particularly problematic if the antibodies are desired to be administered repeatedly, e.g., in treatment of a chronic or recurrent disease condition. Also, because they contain murine constant domains they may not exhibit human effector functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In an effort to eliminate or reduce such problems, chimeric antibodies have been disclosed. Chimeric antibodies contain portions of two different antibodies, typically of two different species. Generally, such antibodies contain human constant regions and variable regions of another species, typically murine variable regions. For example, some mouse/human chimeric antibodies have been reported which exhibit binding characteristics of the parental mouse antibody, and effector functions associated with the human constant region. See, e.g.: U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,745 to Shoemaker et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,369 to Beavers et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397 to Boss et al. Generally, these chimeric antibodies are constructed by preparing a genomic gene library from DNA extracted from pre-existing murine hybridomas. Nishimura et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>47:999 (1987). The library is then screened for variable region genes from both heavy and light chains exhibiting the correct antibody fragment rearrangement patterns. Alternatively, cDNA libraries are prepared from RNA extracted from the hybridomas and screened, or the variable regions are obtained by polymerase chain reaction. The cloned variable region genes are then ligated into an expression vector containing cloned cassettes of the appropriate heavy or light chain human constant region gene. The chimeric genes are then expressed in a cell line of choice, usually a murine myeloma line. Such chimeric antibodies have been used in human therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the production of chimeric mouse-human antibodies derived from CC49 and CC83, which specifically bind TAG-72, has been reported. In this regard, see e.g., EPO 0,365,997 to Mezes et al. (The Dow Chemical Company). One such chimeric CC49 antibody is that produced by the cell line deposited as ATTC No. HB 9884 (Budapest). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Also, Morrison et al. report the preparation of several antitumor chimeric monoclonal antibodies, in <highlight><italic>Important Advances in Oncology, Recombinant Chimeric Monoclonal Antibodies, </italic></highlight>pp. 3-18 (S. A. Rosenberg, ed., 1990) (J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia, Pa.). Results of clinical trials with chimeric cMAb-17-1A in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma now show that this antibody has a 6-fold longer circulation time and significantly reduced immunogenicity as compared to the murine monoclonal antibody from which it was derived. LoBuglio et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>86:4220-4224 (1989); Meredith et al., <highlight><italic>J. Nucl. Med., </italic></highlight>32:1162-1168 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, while such chimeric monoclonal antibodies typically exhibit lesser immunogenicity, they are still potentially immunogenic in humans because they contain murine variable sequences which may elicit antibody responses. Thus, there is the possibility that these chimeric antibodies may elicit an anti-idiotypic response if administered to patients. Saleh et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Immunol. Immunother., </italic></highlight>32:185-190 (1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, when cB72.3(&ggr;4) was administered to patients with colorectal carcinomas, 62% of such patients elicited a human antimurine antibody (HAMA) response, which included an anti-V-region response. This is disadvantageous because a HAMA response would make repeated antitumor antibody administration potentially ineffective because of an increased antibody clearance from the serum (Saleh et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Immunol. Immunother., </italic></highlight>32:180-190 (1990)) and also because of potential allergic reactions (LoBuglio et al., <highlight><italic>Hybridoma, </italic></highlight>5:5117-5123 (1986). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A number of genetic variants of potential clinical utility have been developed from MAb CC49. These include cCC49, a C<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>2 domain-deficient cCC49 (Slavin-Chiorini et al., <highlight><italic>Int. J. Cancer, </italic></highlight>53:97-103 (1993)), and a single chain Fv (sFv) (Milenic et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>51:6365-6371 (1991); Sawyer et al., <highlight><italic>Protein Eng., </italic></highlight>7:1401-1406 (1994)). These molecules may elicit relatively reduced HAMA responses in patients, since they have shown more rapid plasma and whole body clearance rates in mice and rhesus monkeys, as compared to intact IgG. Slavin-Chiorini et al. (1993) (id.); Milenic et al. (1991) (id.). Additionally, novel single-chain immunoglobulin (SClg) molecules derived from cCC49 have been reported and are encoded by single-gene constructs. One such molecule, SCIg&Dgr;C<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>1 consists of CC49 sFv linked to the human &ggr;1 Fc region (Shu et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>90:7995-7999 (1993)) while the other SCIg-IL-2 carries a human interleukin-2 (IL-2) molecule genetically attached to the carboxyl end of the Fc region of SCIg&Dgr;C<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>1 (Kashmiri et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. XVI Intl. Cancer Cong., </italic></highlight>1:183-187 (1994)). Both SCIgs are comparable to cCC49 in antigen binding and antibody cellular cytolytic activity. The biological activity of the IL-2 is also retained in SCIg-IL-2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an effort to alleviate the immunogenicity concerns of chimeric and murine antibodies, the production of &ldquo;humanized&rdquo; antibodies is also known. Ideally, &ldquo;humanization&rdquo; results in an antibody that is non-immunogenic in humans, with substantially complete retention of the antigen-binding properties of the original molecule. In order to retain all the antigen-binding properties of the original antibody, the structure of its combining-site has to be faithfully reproduced in the &ldquo;humanized&rdquo; version. This can potentially be achieved by transplanting the combining site of the nonhuman antibody onto a human framework, either (a) by grafting only the nonhuman CDRs onto human framework and constant regions with or without retention of critical framework residues (Jones et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>321:522 (1986); Verhoeyen et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>239:1539 (1988)); or (b) by transplanting the entire nonhuman variable domains (to preserve ligand-binding properties) but also &ldquo;cloaking&rdquo; them with a human-like surface through judicious replacement of exposed residues (to reduce antigenicity) (Padlan, <highlight><italic>Molec. Immunol., </italic></highlight>28:489 (1991)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Essentially, humanization by CDR grafting involves transplanting only the CDRs onto human fragment and constant regions. Theoretically, this should substantially eliminate immunogenicity (except if allotypic or idiotypic differences exist). Jones et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>321:522-525 (1986); Verhoeyen et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>239:1534-1536 (1988); Riechmann et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>332:323-327 (1988). While such a technique is effective in some instances, CDR-grafting sometimes does not yield the desired result. Rather, it has been reported that some framework residues of the original antibody may also need to be preserved in order to preserve antigen binding activity. Riechmann et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>332:323-327 (1988); Queen et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>86:10023-10029; Tempest et al., <highlight><italic>Biol. Technology, </italic></highlight>9:266-271 (1991); Co et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>351:501 -502 (1991)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As discussed, in order to preserve the antigen-binding properties of the original antibody, the structure of its combining site must be faithfully reproduced in the humanized molecule. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the antibody combining site is built primarily from CDR residues, although some neighboring framework residues have been found to be involved in antigen binding. Amit et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>233:747-753 986); Colman et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>326:358-363 (1987); Sheriff et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>84:8075-8079 (1987); Padlan et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>86:5938-5942 (1989); Fischmann et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>266:12915-12920 (1991); Tulip et al., <highlight><italic>J. Molec. Biol., </italic></highlight>227:122-148 (1992). It has also been found that the structures of the CDR loops are significantly influenced by surrounding framework structures. Chothia et al., <highlight><italic>J. Molec. Biol., </italic></highlight>196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>342:877-883 (1989); Tramomonteno et al., <highlight><italic>J. Molec. Biol., </italic></highlight>215:175-182 (1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Small but significant differences in the relative disposition of the variable light chain (V<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>) and variable heavy (V<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>) domains have been noted (Colman et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>326:358-363 (1987)) and those differences are ostensibly due to variations in the residues involved in the interdomain contact (Padlan et al., <highlight><italic>Molec. Immunol., </italic></highlight>31:169-217 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, structural studies of the effect of the mutation of interior residues, in which changes in side chain volume are involved, have shown that the resulting local deformations are accommodated by shifts in side chain positions that are propagated to distant parts of the molecular interior. This suggests that during humanization the interior residues in the variable domains and in the interface between these domains, or at least the interior volumes, should also be maintained; a humanization protocol in which an interior residue is replaced by one of different physical properties (such as size, charge, or hydrophobicity, etc.), could result in a significant modification of the antigen combining site structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> One method of identifying the framework residues which need to be preserved is by computer modeling. Alternatively, critical framework residues may potentially be identified by comparing known antibody combining site structures (Padlan, <highlight><italic>Molec. Immun., </italic></highlight>31(3):169-217 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The residues which potentially affect antigen binding fall into several groups. The first group comprises residues that are contiguous with the combining site surface and which could therefore make direct contact with antigens. They include the amino-terminal residues and those adjacent to the CDRs. The second group includes residues that could alter the structure or relative alignment of the CDRs either by contacting the CDRs or the opposite chains. The third group comprises amino acids with buried side chains that could influence the structural integrity of the variable domains. The residues in these groups are usually found in the same positions (ibid.) according to the adopted numbering system. See Kabat et al., <highlight><italic>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, </italic></highlight>NIH Pub. No. 91-3242 (5th ed., 1991) (U.S. Dept. Health &amp; Human Services, Bethesda, Md.) and Genbank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, while humanized antibodies are desirable because of their potential low immunogenicity in humans, their production is unpredictable. For example, sequence modification of antibodies may result in substantial or even total loss of antigen binding affinity, or loss of binding specificity. Alternatively, &ldquo;humanized antibodies&rdquo; may still exhibit immunogenicity in humans, irrespective of sequence modification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus, there still exists a significant need in the art for novel humanized antibodies to desired antigens. More specifically, there exists a need in the art for humanized antibodies specific to TAG-72, because of their potential as immunotherapeutic and immunodiagnostic agents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Prior to setting forth the invention, definitions of certain terms which are used in this disclosure are set forth below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Antibody&mdash;This refers to single chain, two-chain, and multi-chain proteins and glycoproteins belonging to the classes of polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, and hetero immunoglobulins (monoclonal antibodies being preferred); it also includes synthetic and genetically engineered variants of these immunoglobulins. &ldquo;Antibody fragment&rdquo; includes Fab, Fab&prime;, F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and Fv fragments, as well as any portion of an antibody having specificity toward a desired target epitope or epitopes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Humanized antibody&mdash;This will refer to an antibody derived from a non-human antibody, typically murine, that retains or substantially retains the antigen-binding properties of the parent antibody but which is less immunogenic in humans. This may be achieved by various methods including (a) grafting only the non-human CDRs onto human framework and constant regions with or without retention of critical framework residues, or (b) transplanting the entire non-human variable domains, but &ldquo;cloaking&rdquo; them with a human-like section by replacement of surface residues. Such methods as are useful in practicing the present invention include those disclosed in Jones et al., Morrison et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>81:6851 -6855 (1984); Morrison and Oi, <highlight><italic>Adv. Immunol., </italic></highlight>44:65-92 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>239:1534-1536 (1988); Padlan, <highlight><italic>Molec. Immun., </italic></highlight>28:489-498 (1991); Padlan, <highlight><italic>Molec. Immun., </italic></highlight>31(3):169-217 (1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Complementarity Determining Region, or CDR&mdash;The term CDR, as used herein, refers to amino acid sequences which together define the binding affinity and specificity of the natural Fv region of a native immunoglobulin binding site as delineated by Kabat et al. (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Framework Region&mdash;The term FR, as used herein, refers to amino acid sequences interposed between CDRs. These portions of the antibody serve to hold the CDRs in an appropriate orientation for antigen binding. In the antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention, the framework regions for the light chain variable region may be selected from the group consisting of human lambda light chain FRs and human kappa subgroup I, II, and III light chain FRs, whether comprising their fully human native amino acid sequences or comprising amino acid sequence modifications necessary to retain or increase binding affinity and/or binding specificity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Constant Region&mdash;The portion of the antibody molecule which confers effector functions. In the present invention, murine constant regions are substituted with human constant regions. The constant regions of the subject chimeric or humanized antibodies are derived from human immunoglobulins. The heavy chain constant region can be selected from any of the five isotypes: alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma or mu. Further, heavy chains of various subclasses (such as the IgG subclasses of heavy chains) are responsible for different effector functions and thus, by choosing the desired heavy chain constant region chimeric antibodies with desired effector function can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Preferred constant regions are gamma 1 (IgG1), gamma 3 (IgG3) and gamma 4 (IgG4). More preferred is a constant region of the gamma 1 (IgG1) isotype. The light chain constant region can be of the kappa or lambda type, preferably of the kappa type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Chimeric antibody&mdash;This is an antibody containing sequences derived from two different antibodies, which typically are of different species. Most typically chimeric antibodies comprise human and murine antibody fragments, generally human constant and murine variable regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Mammals&mdash;Animals that nourish their young with milk secreted by mammary glands, preferably warm blooded mammals, more preferably humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Immunogenicity&mdash;A measure of the ability of a targeting protein or therapeutic moiety to elicit an immune response (humoral or cellular) when administered to a recipient. The present invention is concerned with the immunogenicity of the subject humanized antibodies or fragments thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Humanized antibody of reduced immunogenicity&mdash;This refers to a humanized antibody exhibiting reduced immunogenicity relative to the parent antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Humanized antibody substantially retaining the binding properties of the parent antibody&mdash;This refers to a humanized antibody which retains the ability to specifically bind the antigen recognized by the parent antibody used to produce such humanized antibodies. Preferably the humanized antibody will exhibit the same or substantially the same antigen-binding affinity and avidity as the parent antibody, e.g., CC49. Preferably, the affinity of the antibody will at least about 10% of that of the parent antibody. More preferably, the affinity will be at least about 25%, i.e. at least two-fold less than the affinity of the parent antibody. Most preferably the affinity will be at least about 50% that of the parent antibody. Methods for assaying antigen-binding affinity are well known in the art and include half-maximal binding assays, competition assays, and Scatchard analysis. Suitable antigen binding assays are described in this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In its broadest embodiment, the present invention is directed to humanized antibodies which specifically bind TAG-72, a pancarcinoma antigen expressed by various human cancers, in particular human colon carcinoma. Preferably, such humanized antibodies will be derived from antibodies having good binding affinity to TAG-72, e.g.: B72.3 (Thor et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>46:3118-3127 (1986); Johnson et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>46:850-857 (1986)), deposited as ATCC No. HB 8108; CC49 (ATCC No. HB 9459); CC83 (ATCC No. HB 9453); CC46 (ATCC No. HB 9452); CC92 (ATCC No. HB 9454); CC30 (ATCC No. HB 9457); CC11 (ATCC No. 9455); and CC15 (ATCC No. HB 9460); or chimerized forms thereof (see, e.g., EPO 0,365,997 to Mezes et al., The Dow Chemical Company). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Most preferably, such humanized antibodies will be derived from CC49, which has been reported to target human colon carcinoma xenografts efficiently and also to reduce the growth of the xenograft with good efficacy. Molinolo et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>50:1291 -1298 (1990); Colcher et al., <highlight><italic>J. Natl. Cancer Inst., </italic></highlight>82:1191 -1197 (1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, humanized antibodies afford potential advantages over murine and also chimeric antibodies, e.g., reduced immunogenicity in humans. This is advantageous because it should reduce and potentially eliminate the eliciting of a HAMA response when such humanized antibodies are administered in vivo, e.g., for treatment of cancer or for diagnosis of cancer, e.g., for tumor imaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> However, as noted, humanization may in some instances adversely affect antigen binding. Preferably, the humanized antibodies of the present invention which specifically bind TAG-72 will possess a binding affinity for TAG-72 of at least about 10% and more preferably at least about 25% and most preferably at least about 50% that of the TAG-72 antigen binding affinity of the parent murine antibody, e.g., B72.3, CC49, CC46, CC30,CC11, CC15, CC83, or another parent antibody. Most preferably, the humanized antibodies of the present invention will possess a binding affinity for TAG-72 of at least about 10% and more preferably at least about 25% and most preferably at least about 50% that of the TAG-72 antigen binding affinity of either CC49 or a chimeric CC49 antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the humanized antibodies of the present invention will bind the same epitope as CC49. Such antibodies can be identified based on their ability to compete with CC49 for binding to TAG-72 or to TAG-72-expressing cancer cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In general, the subject humanized antibodies are produced by obtaining nucleic acid sequences encoding the variable heavy and variable light sequences of an antibody which binds TAG-72, preferably CC49, identifying the CDRs in said variable heavy and variable light sequences, and grafting such CDR nucleic acid sequences onto human framework nucleic acid sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the selected human framework will be one that is expected to be suitable for in vivo administration, i.e., does not exhibit immunogenicity. This can be determined, e.g., by prior experience with in vivo usage of such antibodies and by studies of amino acid sequence similarities. In the latter approach, the amino acid sequences of the framework regions of the antibody to be humanized, e.g., CC49, will be compared to those of known human framework regions, and human framework regions used for CDR grafting will be selected which comprise a size and sequence most similar to that of the parent antibody, e.g., a murine antibody which binds TAG-72. Numerous human framework regions have been isolated and their sequences reported in the literature. See, e.g., Kabat et al., (id.).This enhances the likelihood that the resultant CDR-grafted &ldquo;humanized&rdquo; antibody, which contains the CDRs of the parent (e.g., murine) antibody grafted onto the selected human framework regions will significantly retain the antigen binding structure and thus the binding affinity of the parent antibody. As a result of such studies, the FRs of REI and NEWM antibodies have been identified as having amino acid sequences which are likely to allow the CDRs of CC49 to retain a significant degree of antigen binding affinity. As noted, the selected human framework regions will preferably be those that are expected to be suitable for in vivo administration, i.e., not immunogenic. Based on their amino acid sequences, REI and NEWM human framework regions are expected to be substantially non-immunogenic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Methods for cloning nucleic acid sequences encoding immunoglobulins are well known in the art. Such methods will generally involve the amplification of the immunoglobulin sequences to be cloned using appropriate primers by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers suitable for amplifying immunoglobulin nucleic acid sequences, and specifically murine variable heavy and variable light sequences have been reported in the literature. After such immunoglobulin sequences have been cloned, they will be sequenced by methods well known in the art. This will be effected in order to identify the variable heavy and variable light sequences, and more specifically the portions thereof which constitute the CDRs and FRs. This can be effected by well known methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Once the CDRs and FRs of the cloned antibody sequences which are to be humanized have been identified, the amino acid sequences encoding CDRs are then identified (deduced based on the nucleic acid sequences and the genetic code and by comparison to previous antibody sequences) and the corresponding nucleic acid sequences are grafted onto selected human FRs. This may be accomplished by use of appropriate primers and linkers. Methods for selecting suitable primers and linkers to provide for ligation of desired nucleic acid sequences is well within the purview of the ordinary artisan and include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. No. 4,816,397 to Boss et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539 to Winter et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> After the CDRs are grafted onto selected human FRs, the resultant &ldquo;humanized&rdquo; variable heavy and variable light sequences will then be expressed to produce a humanized Fv or humanized antibody which binds TAG-72. Typically, the humanized variable heavy and variable light sequences will be expressed as a fusion protein with human constant domain sequences, so that an intact antibody which binds TAG-72 is obtained. However, this is not necessary as the variable heavy and light sequences can also be expressed in the absence of constant sequences to produce a humanized Fv which binds TAG-72. However, fusion of human constant sequences to the humanized variable region(s) is potentially desirable because the resultant humanized antibody which binds TAG-72 will then possess human effector functions such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. Such activity has been found in chimeric antibodies, including CC49. The humanized anti-TAG-72 antibodies of the present invention can also support such effector function activity with the added advantage of a greatly decreased risk of a HAMA response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Methods for synthesizing DNAs encoding a protein of known sequence are well known in the art. Using such methods, DNA sequences which encode the subject humanized V<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>sequences are synthesized, and then expressed in vector systems suitable for expression of recombinant antibodies. This may be effected in any vector system which provides for the subject humanized V<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>sequences to be expressed as a fusion protein with human constant domain sequences and to associate to produce functional (antigen binding) antibodies. Expression vectors and host cells suitable for expression of recombinant antibodies and humanized antibodies in particular, are well known in the art. </paragraph>

The vector may, e.g., be a bare nucleic acid segment, a carrier-associated nucleic acid segment, a nucleoprotein, a plasmid, a virus, a viroid, or a transposable element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Host cells known to be capable of expressing functional immunoglobulins include, e.g.: mammalian cells such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells; COS cells; myeloma cells, such as NSO and SP2/0 cells; bacteria such as <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli;</italic></highlight>yeast cells such as <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae; </italic></highlight>and other host cells. Of these, CHO cells are used by many researchers given their ability to effectively express and secrete immunoglobulins. NSO cells are one of the preferred types of host cells useful in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Essentially, recombinant expression of humanized antibodies is effected by one of two general methods. In the first method, the host cells are transfected with a single vector which provides for the expression of both heavy and light variable sequences optionally fused to selected constant regions. In the second method, host cells are transfected with two vectors, each of which encodes a different variable chain (i.e. a variable heavy chain or variable light chain); each variable chain-encoding vector may optionally provide for the expression of the variable chain fused to a selected constant region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Human constant domain sequences are well known in the art, and have been reported in the literature. Preferred human light chain constant sequences include the kappa and lambda constant light sequences. Preferred human heavy constant sequences include human gamma 1, human gamma 2, human gamma 3, human gamma 4, and mutated versions thereof which provide for altered effect or function, e.g., enhanced in vivo half-life or reduced Fc receptor binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> After expression, the antigen binding affinity of the resulting humanized antibody will be assayed by known methods, e.g., Scatchard analysis. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the antigen-binding affinity of the humanized antibody will be at least 25% of that of the parent antibody, e.g., CC49, i.e. a minimum of two-fold less than that of native or chimeric CC49. Most preferably, the affinity of the humanized antibody will be at least about 50% of that of the parent antibody, e.g., CC49. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In some instances, humanized antibodies produced by grafting CDRs (from an antibody which binds TAG-72) onto selected human framework regions may provide humanized antibodies having the desired affinity to TAG-72. However, it may be necessary or desirable to further modify specific residues of the selected human framework in order to enhance antigen binding. This may occur because it is believed that some framework residues are essential to or at least affect antigen binding. Preferably, those framework residues of the parent (e.g., murine) antibody which maintain or affect combining-site structures will be retained. These residues may be identified by X-ray crystallography of the parent antibody or Fab fragment, thereby identifying the three-dimensional structure of the antigen-binding site. Also, framework residues involved in antigen binding may potentially be identified based on previously reported humanized murine antibody sequences. Thus, it may be beneficial to retain such framework residues or others from the parent murine antibody to optimize TAG-72 binding. Preferably, such methodology will confer a &ldquo;human-like&rdquo; character to the resultant humanized antibody thus rendering it less immunogenic while retaining the interior and contacting residues which affect antigen-binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The present invention further embraces variants and equivalents which are substantially homologous to the humanized antibodies and antibody fragments set forth herein. These may contain, e.g., conservative substitution mutations, i.e. the substitution of one or more amino acids by similar amino acids. For example, conservative substitution refers to the substitution of an amino acid with another within the same general class, e.g., one acidic amino acid with another acidic amino acid, one basic amino acid with another basic amino acid, or one neutral amino acid by another neutral amino acid. What is intended by a conservative amino acid substitution is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;substantially homologous&rdquo; is used in regard to the similarity of a subject amino acid sequence (of an oligo- or poly-peptide or protein) to a related, reference amino acid sequence. This phrase is defined as at least about 75% Correspondence, i.e. the state of identical amino acid residues being situated in parallel, between the subject and reference sequences when those sequences are in &ldquo;alignment,&rdquo; i.e. when a minimal number of &ldquo;null&rdquo; bases have been inserted in the subject and/or reference sequences so as to maximize the number of existing bases in correspondence between the sequences. &ldquo;Null&rdquo; bases are not part of the subject and reference sequences; also, the minimal number of &ldquo;null&rdquo; bases inserted in the subject sequence may differ from the minimal number inserted in the reference sequence. In this definition, a reference sequence is considered &ldquo;related&rdquo; to a subject sequence where both amino acid sequences make up proteins or portions of proteins which are either &agr;TAG-72 antibodies or antibody fragments with &agr;TAG-72 binding affinity. Each of the proteins comprising these &agr;TAG-72 antibodies or antibody fragments may independently be antibodies or antibody fragments or hi- or multi-functional proteins, e.g., such as fusion proteins, bi- and multi-specific antibodies, single chain antibodies, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to nucleic acid sequences from such humanized antibodies may be expressed, as well as expression vectors which provide for the production of such humanized antibodies in transformed host cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiments, such humanized antibodies and corresponding nucleic acid sequences will be derived from CC49. Most preferably, the humanized heavy chains will have the amino acid sequences set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the humanized light chains will have the amino acid sequences set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, as discussed, the invention further contemplates other modifications of these humanized variable heavy and light sequences, e.g., sequences which further comprise one or more conservative amino acid substitutions or sequences which retain one or more additional murine framework residues which affect (enhance) antigen binding, which are alternatives to or supplements for those already shown in these Figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The subject humanized antibodies, because they specifically bind TAG-72, a pancarcinoma antigen expressed on many different cancer cell types (e.g., colon carcinoma, breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, prostate carcinoma), and further because they are expected to be significantly non-immunogenic in humans, should be suitable for use as therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of cancers characterized by TAG-72 expression, and as diagnostic agents, e.g., for use in tumor imaging or in the RIGS system (Radioimmunoguided Surgery system of Neoprobe Corp., Dublin, Ohio). See Hinkle et al., Antibody, <highlight><italic>Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals, </italic></highlight>4(3):339-358 (1991). One skilled in the art would be able, by routine experimentation, to determine what an effective, non-toxic amount of antibody would be for the purpose of treating cancer. Generally, however, an effective dosage will be in the range of about 0.05 to 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The antibodies of the invention may be administered to a mammal in accordance with the aforementioned methods of treatment in an amount sufficient to produce such effect to a therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic effect. Such antibodies of the invention can be administered to such mammal in a conventional dosage form prepared by combining the antibody of the invention with a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle, diluent, and/or excipient according to known techniques to form a suspension, injectable solution, or other formulation. It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined, the route of administration and other well-known variables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutically acceptable formulations may include, e.g., a suitable solvent, preservatives such as benzyl alcohol if desired, and a buffer. Useful solvent may include, e.g., water, aqueous alcohols, glycols, and phsophonate and carbonate esters. Such aqueous solutions contain no more than 50% by volume of organic solvent. Suspension-type formulations may include a liquid suspending medium as a carrier, e.g., aqueous polyvinylpyrrolidone, inert oils such as vegetable oils or highly refined mineral oils, or aqueous cellulose ethers such as aqueous carboxymethylcellulose. A thickener such as gelatin or an alginate may also be present, one or more natural or synthetic surfactants or antifoam agents may be used, and one or more suspending agents such as sorbitol or another sugar may be employed therein. Such formations may contain one or more adjuvants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The route of administration of the antibody (or fragment thereof) of the invention may be oral, parenteral, by inhalation or topical. The term parenteral as used herein includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, vaginal or intraperitoneal administration. The subcutaneous, intravenous and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are generally preferred. The daily parenteral and oral dosage regimens for employing humanized antibodies of the invention prophylactically or therapeutically will generally be in the range of about 0.005 to 100, but preferably about 0.5 to 10, milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The antibody of the invention may also be administered by inhalation. By &ldquo;inhalation&rdquo; is meant intranasal and oral inhalation administration. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration, such as an aerosol formulation or a metered dose inhaler, may be prepared by conventional techniques. The preferred dosage amount of a compound of the invention to be employed is generally within the range of about 0.1 to 1000 milligrams, preferably about 10 to 100 milligrams/kilogram body weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The antibody of the invention may also be administered topically. By topical administration is meant non-systemic administration. This includes the administration of a humanized antibody (or humanized antibody fragment) formulation of the invention externally to the epidermis or to the buccal cavity, and instillation of such an antibody into the ear, eye, or nose, and wherever it does not significantly enter the bloodstream. By systemic administration is meant oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular administration. The amount of an antibody required for therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic effect will, of course, vary with the antibody chosen, the nature and severity of the condition being treated and the animal undergoing treatment, and is ultimately at the discretion of the physician. A suitable topical dose of an antibody of the invention will generally be within the range of about 1 to 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight daily. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Formulations </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> While it is possible for an antibody or fragment thereof to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation. The active ingredient may comprise, for topical administration, from 0.001% to 10% w/w, e.g., from 1% to 2% by weight of the formulation, although it may comprise as much as 10% w/w but preferably not in excess of 5% w/w and more preferably from 0. 1% to 1% w/w of the formulation. The topical formulations of the present invention, comprise an active ingredient together with one or more acceptable carrier(s) therefor and optionally any other therapeutic ingredients(s). The carrier(s) must be &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of where treatment is required, such as liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear, or nose. Drops according to the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions and may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitable aqueous solution of a bactericidal and/or fungicidal agent and/or any other suitable preservative, and preferably including a surface active agent. The resulting solution may then be clarified and sterilized by filtration and transferred to the container by an aseptic technique. Examples of bactericidal and fungicidal agents suitable for inclusion in the drops are phenylmercuric nitrate or acetate (0.002%), benzalkonium chloride (0.01 %) and chlorhexidine acetate (0.01%). Suitable solvents for the preparation of an oily solution include glycerol, diluted alcohol and propylene glycol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Lotions according to the present invention include those suitable for application to the skin or eye. An eye lotion may comprise a sterile aqueous solution optionally containing a bactericide and may be prepared by methods similar to those for the preparation of drops. Lotions or liniments for application to the skin may also include an agent to hasten drying and to cool the skin, such as an alcohol or acetone, and/or a moisturizer such as glycerol or an oil such as castor oil or arachis oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Creams, ointments or pastes according to the present invention are semi-solid formulations of the active ingredient for external application. They may be made by mixing the active ingredient in finely-divided or powdered form, alone or in solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous fluid, with the aid of suitable machinery, with a greasy or non-greasy basis. The basis may comprise hydrocarbons such as hard, soft or liquid paraffin, glycerol, beeswax, a metallic soap; a mucilage; an oil of natural origin such as almond, corn, arachis, castor or olive oil; wool fat or its derivatives, or a fatty acid such as stearic or oleic acid together with an alcohol such as propylene glycol or macrogels. The formulation may incorporate any suitable surface active agent such as an anionic, cationic or non-ionic surface active such as sorbitan esters or polyoxyethylene derivatives thereof. Suspending agents such as natural gums, cellulose derivatives or inorganic materials such as silicaceous silicas, and other ingredients such as lanolin, may also be included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Kits according to the present invention include frozen or lyophilized humanized antibodies or humanized antibody fragments to be reconstituted, respectively, by thawing (optionally followed by further dilution) or by suspension in a (preferably buffered) liquid vehicle. The kits may also include buffer and/or excipient solutions (in liquid or frozen form)&mdash;or buffer and/or excipient powder preparations to be reconstituted with water&mdash;for the purpose of mixing with the humanized antibodies or humanized antibody fragments to produce a formulation suitable for administration. Thus, preferably the kits containing the humanized antibodies or humanized antibody fragments are frozen, Iyophilized, pre-diluted, or pre-mixed at such a concentration that the addition of a predetermined amount of heat, of water, or of a solution provided in the kit will result in a formulation of sufficient concentration and pH as to be effective for in vivo or in vitro use in the treatment or diagnosis of cancer. Preferably, such a kit will also comprise instructions for reconstituting and using the humanized antibody or humanized antibody fragment composition to treat or detect cancer. The kit may also comprise two or more component parts for the reconstituted active composition. For example, a second component part&mdash;in addition to the humanized antibodies or humanized antibody fragments&mdash;may be bifunctional chelant, bifunctional chelate, or a therapeutic agent such as a radionuclide, which when mixed with the humanized antibodies or humanized antibody fragments forms a conjugated system therewith. The above-noted buffers, excipients, and other component parts can be sold separately or together with the kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the optimal quantity and spacing of individual dosages of a humanized antibody or humanized antibody fragment of the invention will be determined by the nature and extent of the condition being treated, the form, route and site of administration, and the particular animal being treated, and that such optima can be determined by conventional techniques. It will also be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the number of doses of an antibody or fragment thereof of the invention given per day for a defined number of days, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional course of treatment determination tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The subject humanized antibodies may also be administered in combination with other anti-cancer agents, e.g., other antibodies or drugs. Also, the subject humanized antibodies or fragments may be directly or indirectly attached to effector having therapeutic activity. Suitable effector moieties include by way of example cytokines (IL-2, TNF, interferons, colony stimulating factors, IL-1, etc.), cytotoxins (Pseudomonas exotoxin, ricin, abrin, etc.), radionuclides, such as <highlight><superscript>90</superscript></highlight>Y, <highlight><subscript>131</subscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>99m</superscript></highlight>Tc, <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In, <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, among others, drugs (methotrexate, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, etc.), immunomodulators, therapeutic enzymes (e.g., beta-galactosidase), anti-proliferative agents, etc. The attachment of antibodies to desired effectors is well known. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,990 to Cheng et al. Moreover, bifunctional linkers for facilitating such attachment are well known and widely available. Also, chelators (chelants and chelates) providing for attachment of radionuclides are well known and available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the subject humanized antibodies or fragments specific to TAG-72 may be used as immunodiagnostic agents both in vivo and in vitro. A particularly preferred usage is for in vivo imaging of cancer cell lesions which express TAG-72. The subject antibodies are preferred because they should elicit no significant HAMA or allergic response. Thus, they may be used repeatedly to monitor the disease status of a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As noted above, another preferred application of the subject humanized antibodies or fragments thereof is in the RIGS system (Radioimmunoguided Surgery system of Neoprobe Corp., Dublin, Ohio). This technique, also known as the RIGS system involves the intravenous administration of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody or its fragment prior to surgery. After allowing for tumor uptake and blood clearance of radioactivity, the patient is taken to the operating room where surgical exploration is effected with the aid of a hand-held gamma activity probe, e.g., NEOPROBE 1000 (Neoprobe Corp., Dublin, Ohio). This helps the surgeon identify the tumor metastases and improve the complications of excision. The RIGS system (Radioimmunoguided Surgery system of Neoprobe Corp., Dublin, Ohio) is advantageous because it allows for the detection of tumors not otherwise detectable by visual inspection and/or palpation. See, O&apos;Dwyer et al., <highlight><italic>Arch. Surg., </italic></highlight>121:1 391-1394 (1986). This technique is described in detail in Hinkle et al., Antibody, <highlight><italic>Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmacouticals, </italic></highlight>4:(3)339-358 (1991) (citing numerous references describing this technique). This reference also discloses the use of this technique with the CC49 monoclonal antibody itself. This technique is particularly useful for cancers of the colon, breast, pancreas, and ovaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The subject humanized antibodies or humanized antibody fragments thereof radiolabeled with radionuclides which are suitable for in vivo administration, e.g., iodine radionuclides such as <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>I and <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I; <highlight><superscript>111</superscript></highlight>In and <highlight><superscript>99m</superscript></highlight>Tc are also suitable radiolabels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The subject humanized antibodies may be used alone or in combination with other antibodies. Also, the subject humanized antibodies may be prepared in the form of a diagnostically effective composition. Generally, this will entail the incorporation of diagnostically acceptable carriers and excipients, and labels which provide for detection. Suitable labels include diagnostic radionuclides, enzymes, etc. Methods for using antibodies for tumor imaging are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The invention will be further clarified by a consideration of the following examples, which are intended to be purely exemplary of the present invention are thus to be construed as merely illustrative examples and not limitations of the scope of the present invention in any way. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> All recombination work was performed upon DNA sequences in plasmid M13 vectors. The source of the NEWM framework regions for producing the initial humanized CC49 VH was an M13 construct bearing, between the M13 BamH I and Hind III sites a DNA segment having the nucleotide sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The source of REI framework regions for producing the initial humanized CC49 VL was an M13 construct bearing&mdash;between the M13 BamH I and Hind III sites&mdash;a DNA segment encoding the REI amino acid sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> When overlap-extension procedures were used to introduce mutations into a given DNA sequence, double stranded M13 DNA was utilized. In contrast, when extension-ligation procedures were used instead, the oligonucleotides were designed to anneal to only one of the two DNA strands. In this latter procedure, the M13 DNA was first treated to substitute uridine for every thymidine base in the DNA, to produce uridinylated DNA. This was accomplished by transfecting the M13 plasmid DNA into competent cells lacking dUTPase and uracil glycosylase, normally RZ1032 cells (though CJ236 cells available from Bio-Rad of Hercules, Calif., are also suitable) by combining the following ingredients. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Humanized antibodies were expressed in pSV vectors grown in NSO cells. The humanized variable region constructs which were produced in the plasmid, M13, were digested with 10 U each of Hind III and BamH I (both from BRL, i.e. Gibco BRL) for 1 hour at 37&deg; C. in a final volume of 100 &mgr;L with Tris-EDTA buffer. The resulting DNA fragments were then run on a low melting point agarose gel, the band containing the humanized construct DNA was cut out, and the DNA was purified using an ELUTIP &lsquo;d&rsquo; column with 20 &mgr;L Tris-EDTA buffer. 10 &mgr;L of the purified DNA preparation was then combined with 1 &mgr;L of a Hind III and BamH II 1-digested pSV preparation, 3 &mgr;L of 5&times;ligase buffer, and 1 U of T4 DNA ligase (BRL), in order to insert the construct into a pSV plasmid. Humanized CC49 VH constructs were inserted into pSVgpt vectors bearing a human IgG1 heavy chain constant region; the pSVgpt vector used is the &ldquo;aLYS-30&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Humanized CC49 VL constructs were inserted into pSVhyg vectors bearing a human &kgr; light chain constant domain; the pSVhyg vector used in the &ldquo;aLys-17&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Each humanized variable region construct was inserted adjacent to the respective constant region, i.e. so as to replace either the HuVHLYS or the HuVLLys segment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The resulting vectors were transfected into NSO cells as follows. About 3 &mgr;g of the VH vector, or about 6 &mgr;g of the VL vector, produced by the pSV-insertion procedures, was then linearized by digestion with 10 U Pvul (Gibco BRL). The digested DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and redissolved in 50 &mgr;L of water. NSO cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 mL Dulbecco&apos;s Modified Eagle&apos;s Medium (DMEM) and then transferred to a Gene Pulser cuvette (Bio-Rad). The DNA from both one VH and one VL construct was gently mixed with the cells by pipetting and the cuvette was left on ice for 5 minutes. Next, the cuvette was inserted between the electrodes of the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser and a single pulse of 170V at 960 &mgr;F was applied. The contents of the cuvette were then transferred to a flask containing 20 mL DMEM and the cells were allowed to rest for 1-2 days at 37&deg; C. Cells were again harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 36 mL selective DMEM. 1.5 mL aliquots of this resuspension were placed in each well of a 24-well plate and incubated at 37&deg; C. for 4 days, at which time the medium in each well was replaced with 1.5 mL of fresh selective DMEM. After 6 more days of incubation at 37&deg; C., surviving cell colonies were visible to the naked eye and the supernatants of each well were assayed for antibody production. Both whole antibody production (i.e. without purification) and purified antibody production were assayed. To obtain purified antibodies, the supernatants were passed through a protein A column. </paragraph>

The CDRs for murine CC49 were grafted onto human frameworks according to known methods as discussed supra. In particular, human frameworks were selected from antibodies which, based on previous studies, were predicted to be suitable, i.e. which should not adversely affect antigen binding and not exhibit significant immunogenicity in humans. The human frameworks selected for the variable heavy and variable light chains, respectively, were NEWM and REI. In the production of the initial version of the humanized VH, certain murine framework residues were also retained which, based on previous studies, might allow retention of antigen binding properties. Specifically, residues Y27, T30, A72, F95, and T97 of the murine heavy chain were initially retained. Concurrently, an alternate version of the humanized VH was produced which retained, in addition, the murine framework residue A24. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The production of these NEWM-grafted humanized CC49 VHs was accomplished according to the annealing and extension-ligation protocols described above, using a single-stranded M13 DNA template bearing, between the Hind III and BamH I sites thereof, a DNA segment having the nucleotide sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> A second variant of HUVH was made by replacing the threonine residue shown at position 74 of the CC49 NMVH in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with the murine FR residue, Lysine. This was achieved by the Vent DNA polymerase PCR overlap extension protocol described above, using two primer-and-mutating oligonucleotide pairs&mdash;oligonucleotides 10 and 6, and oligonucleotides 11 and 7. Each pair was used in conjunction with one of the strands of a dsDNA template&mdash;situated between the Hind III and BamH I sites of plasmid M13&mdash;and having the nucleotide sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> (the upper strand was used with pair 11 &amp; 7). Mutating oligonucleotides 6 and 7 were designed and synthesized with the following sequences.

<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The two heavy chain constructs, HUVHS and HUVHK, which were situated in M13 vectors, were grown and expressed in TG1 cells. The polypeptide expression products of these constructs were sequenced and the amino acid sequences of these constructs are presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> These DNA constructs were then inserted into pSV expression vectors as described above. Combinations of these with HUVK were then inserted into NSO cells. These combinations were expressed and the resulting antibodies were then tested for antigen binding characteristics using the ELISA assay set forth above. The results of these assays are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. These figures show that neither the K74 nor S76 mutation resulted in enhanced antigen binding; in fact the S76 mutation caused an approximate 2-fold reduction in affinity as measured by this ELISA assay. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The affinity constant of the final humanized CC49 antibody, CC49 HuVH/HuVK, of Example 1 (having variable heavy and variable light chain sequences shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, respectively) were measured according to the ELISA assay protocol set forth above. The ATCC (Budapest) HB 9884 chimeric CC49 antibody was used as an internal control. This ELISA assay was performed repeatedly using purified samples of humanized and chimeric CC49 monoclonal antibodies in order to substantiate the accuracy of the values obtained and to account for inherent assay-to-assay variability. Typical results from such an analysis are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. A summary of the results obtained during these analyses is shown in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> These results demonstrate that the humanized anti-TAG-72 antibody HuVH/HuVK (having the variable heavy and variable light sequences shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, respectively) has a binding affinity approximating that of a chimeric CC49 antibody (MuVH/MuVK). Therefore, it is expected that this humanized antibody will effectively target TAG-72-expressing carcinomas in vivo. Also, based on its sequence this antibody should exhibit little or no immunogenicity in humans, and exhibit advantageous plasma clearance, metabolic properties, and effective tumor targeting in relation to the murine CC49, and also in relation to chimeric versions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> A murine plasmacytoma cell line which produces this humanized CC49 antibody was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, on Oct. 16, 1996) and this cell line was accorded accession number ATCC CRL-12209. This deposit was made in accordance with the Budapest Treaty. This deposited cell line will be made irrevocably available, without restriction, upon issuance of a patent to this application or any other application claiming priority to this application under 35 U.S.C. &sect;120. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Based on the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the humanized antibodies disclosed in Examples 1-3, exhibit antigen-binding characteristics, i.e. TAG-72 affinities comparable to the parent monoclonal antibody, nCC49 (murine antibody), and to chimeric antibodies derived from nCC49, e.g., cCC49. Moreover, based on the foregoing results, these antibodies possess properties which will render them well suited for usage as in vivo diagnostics or therapeutics, e.g., improved serum clearance, metabolic properties, and little or no immunogenicity in humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> These properties are highly significant because these properties will enable the subject humanized antibodies to be administered repeatedly, in large dosages, and over a prolonged period of time without significant adverse effects, e.g., a HAMA response or non-specific cytotoxicity. This is important for cancer treatment as well as for cancer diagnosis as it enables these antibodies to be used over prolonged time periods. Moreover, the clearance properties of the subject human antibodies will enable these antibodies to effectively target desired target sites, e.g., TAG-72 expressing carcinomas (because of the effects of serum clearance on targeting efficiency). Therefore, the humanized antibodies of the present invention comprise a substantial improvement in relation to previously disclosed antibodies specific to TAG-72. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this specification or practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with the true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims.
