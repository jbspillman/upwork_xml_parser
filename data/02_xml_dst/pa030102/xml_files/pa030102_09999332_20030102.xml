<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A microchip is provided having a grayscale feature and a micromachined alignment feature registered to the grayscale feature. A process is also provided to ensure proper registration between the alignment feature and the grayscale feature by using a single exposure mask to define the grayscale feature and the alignment feature. In particular, the exposure mask includes a grayscale pattern representing the grayscale feature and an alignment pattern representing an alignment feature located at a specified position with respect to the grayscale pattern. The alignment pattern in the exposure mask marks the location of the micromachined feature in the microchip. Through a multistep deposition and etching process, the grayscale feature is formed within the substrate along with a micromachined alignment feature to enable the microchip to be mechanically aligned to other components of an optical system while maintaining proper registration of the grayscale feature. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a microchip comprising a grayscale feature and a micromachined alignment feature and a process for creating such a microchip, and more specifically to a process for creating the grayscale feature in registration with the micromachined alignment feature from a single exposure mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Microchips having optical structures, such as lenses or gratings, often need to be accurately aligned with other discrete components, such as optical fibers, lasers, and photodetectors, as well as additional microchips. The desired alignments can be accomplished passively by using micromachined alignment features on the microchip to register the microchip with the other selected components. However, registration of the microchip with the discrete components does not necessarily ensure proper optical alignment between the optical structures on the microchip and their counterparts on the registered components. In order to facilitate the registration of the optical structures on the microchip with the optical structures on the registered components, the optical structures on the microchip need to be accurately aligned relative to the micromachined surface features on the microchip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Typically, many desired optical structures are not binary in nature but are instead fabricated using a grayscale exposure mask to create the desired surface profiles. In contrast, however, a binary mask is particularly suited to the creation of micromachined alignment features. Alignment surface features are most reliable when they have clear demarcations of sufficient depth to permit precise alignment between discrete components. Therefore, a need exists for a process for creating a microchip having optical features, such as those created by a grayscale mask, in addition to micromachined surface features, created by a binary mask. While separate exposure masks may often be used, i.e. one mask for the grayscale features and a second mask for the binary features, the use of two exposure masks introduces the potential for mis-registration between the alignment features and optical features, due to misalignment between the two separate exposure masks. Therefore, it would be beneficial to develop a method for creating alignment features and grayscale features on a microchip from a single exposure mask. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a process is provided for creating a grayscale feature and a micromachined alignment feature within a substrate from a single exposure mask. The exposure mask includes a grayscale pattern representing the desired grayscale feature and an alignment pattern for defining the location of one or more micromachined features relative to the position of the grayscale pattern. The use of a single exposure mask ensures that the grayscale features and the alignment features are accurately aligned with respect to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The process of the present invention includes a step of providing a protective layer over a first surface of a substrate at the intended location of the alignment feature. An unprotected portion of the first surface of the substrate is provided at the intended location of the grayscale features. The unprotected portion may be formed by removing a section of the protective layer at the desired location to form the unprotected portion of the first surface of the substrate. A photosensitive mask layer is then deposited over the protective layer and the unprotected portion of the first surface of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The photosensitive mask layer is exposed to light of a selected wavelength through a single exposure mask. The light exposure functions to develop a replica of the selected grayscale pattern within the photosensitive mask layer at the unprotected portion of the first surface. The light exposure also functions to develop a replica of the selected alignment pattern within the photosensitive mask layer at the protected portion of the first surface. The portion of the photosensitive mask layer containing the replica of the selected alignment pattern is completely removed to produce an alignment aperture through the photosensitive mask corresponding to the intended location of the micromachined feature. Defining the location of the micromachined feature relative to the position of the grayscale feature using the single exposure mask functions to precisely align such features in the substrate to provide an alignment feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Next, a portion of the protective layer is removed from at least a region within the alignment aperture to create an alignment cavity in the protective layer. The alignment cavity functions to precisely marks the location of a selected micromachined feature relative to the substrate. The grayscale pattern recorded in the photosensitive mask layer is then transferred into the substrate to create the desired grayscale feature in the substrate. This transfer process also functions to remove any remaining portions of the photosensitive mask layer from the protective layer of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A feature-protection layer is then deposited over the grayscale feature and over the protective layer including the cavity in the protective layer. A barrier layer, such as a photoresist layer, is then patterned over the feature-protection layer over the substrate. An opening in the barrier layer is provided over the cavity in the protective layer for access to a portion of the feature-protection layer. The barrier layer functions to protect the portion of the feature-protection layer in the vicinity of the grayscale feature during further processing. The exposed portion of the feature-protection layer within the barrier layer opening is removed to expose the alignment cavity. The barrier layer is then removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The remaining portion of the protective layer located at the base of the alignment cavity is then removed to expose the first surface of the substrate located at the base of the cavity. The exposed portion of the substrate at the base of the alignment cavity is then selectively removed to create the desired micromachined feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a particular application of the process, the protective layer over the first surface of the substrate may comprise two layers, a first inner layer comprising SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and a second outer layer comprising silicon nitride. In this configuration, the step of removing a portion of the protective layer to form the alignment cavity may comprise the step of substantially removing the outer silicon nitride layer to expose the inner layer at the base of the alignment cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition, the step of creating a micromachined feature may include the step of anisotropic etching, which is particularly useful for creating micromachined features having sloped sidewalls, such as a V-shaped groove or pit. In this regard, the substrate material is chosen to have the proper crystal orientation for use with anisotropic etching to produce sloped sidewalls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a microchip fabricated by the above process. The microchip comprises a substrate and a grayscale feature formed within a first surface of the substrate. A protective layer is disposed over the substrate. The protective layer includes an alignment feature aperture disposed at a selected positioned relative the grayscale feature. The microchip comprises an alignment feature disposed within the alignment feature aperture. The grayscale feature may comprise a refractive optical element or diffractive optical element. In particular the grayscale feature may comprise a lenslet array. The alignment feature may include a micromachined feature, such as a V-groove or pit. The microchip may optionally include a feature-protection layer disposed over the grayscale feature.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an optical microchip or substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having both a grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> representing an optical device and a micromachined feature <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> providing an alignment feature. The present invention also provides a process for fabricating such a microchip. Typical grayscale features include, for example, a refractive or diffractive optical element, such as a lenslet or lenslet array. Typical micromachined features include pits, cantilevers, and V-grooves. Proper alignment between the micromachined feature <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is ensured through the use of a single exposure mask, containing representations of both the grayscale and alignment features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures in which like elements are numbered alike, there is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2 a</cross-reference> substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> patterned according to the first step, step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, of the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. The substrate material is chosen with regard to the nature of the particular optical device and the micromachined feature <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be fabricated. Examples of materials that may be used in the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> include Si, GaAs, and InP. The crystal orientation of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be chosen with respect to the desired orientation of the sidewalls of the micromachined feature <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The selection of the crystal orientation is made in conjunction with the exposure mask orientation and the type of processing used, such as in the last step of the process, step <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, to define the sidewall orientation of grooves or cavities to be formed in the substrate. For example, (100)-oriented Si may be selected to create a micromachined feature <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having sidewalls that are sloped with respect to the top surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, (110)-oriented Si may be selected to create a micromachined feature having sidewalls that are perpendicular to the top surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> made from Si is provided. The processing of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> begins at step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> by providing a protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on a first surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to cover at least that portion of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in which the micromachined feature <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is to be located. The areas on the first surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at which the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located are not covered by the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In application, the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be deposited over the entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, portions of the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be removed to expose the first surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the selected areas for the grayscale features <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be deposited onto the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a single layer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Alternatively, protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may comprise separate layers to facilitate further processing of the chip, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As such, a first protective layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be deposited onto the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed of a material such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and a second protective layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be deposited over the first protective layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprising a material such as silicon nitride. The materials of the protective layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are chosen so that they may be selectively removed during subsequent processing. SiN/SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>represents one such pairing of the materials. A suitable thickness for each of the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the SiN layers may be on the order of 0.1-4 microns. As an alternative, the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may comprise a metal layer, such as Cr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Following the application of the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a photosensitive mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is deposited, at step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, over the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the exposed portion of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> not covered by the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The photosensitive mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is patterned by exposure, at step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, to light through a single exposure mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The photosensitive material is processed to replicate a selected grayscale pattern <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a selected pattern of alignment feature apertures <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the photosensitive mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The single exposure mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a representation of the desired grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a representation of the alignment feature apertures <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> located at precise positions with respect to one another. The representation of the alignment feature apertures in the exposure mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> defines the intended location of the micromachined features <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Inclusion of both the grayscale representation and the alignment feature representation on the same exposure mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> permits their transfer to the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via a single exposure step, at step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The exposure mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is oriented with respect to the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that the alignment features in the exposure mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are in proper registration at the corresponding positions of the protective layer portions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. To aid in this registration, it is desirable that the protective layer portions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> cover a greater area than that of the corresponding alignment features to provide a margin of error in registering the exposure mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the protective layer portions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are wider than the alignment feature apertures <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to be formed in the photosensitive mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The alignment feature apertures <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and grayscale pattern <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be created in the photosensitive mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> using lithographic processes. For example, the photosensitive mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may comprise photoresist, which is exposed using light of a selected wavelength transmitted through the exposure mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to replicate the grayscale and alignment features in the photosensitive mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, at step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Standard photoresist processing techniques may be used to selectively remove portions of the photoresist to create the alignment feature apertures <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the selected grayscale pattern <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, at step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Processing continues with the selective removal, at step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, of a portion of the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> located within the alignment feature apertures <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to create alignment cavities <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The method of removal of the portion of the masking layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is selected so that the photosensitive mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is unaffected, thus maintaining the integrity of the grayscale pattern <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To increase control over the amount of material removed from the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> when creating the alignment cavities <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, it may be desirable to create a two layered structure having first and second protective layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. By choosing the materials for the first and second protective layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> appropriately, the second protective layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be selectively removed at the location of the alignment feature apertures <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> without removing the first protective layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The process of removal makes use of suitable methods, such as wet or dry etching. For example, reactive ion etching (RIE) using NF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>may be employed for the selective removal of the second protective layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the case where such a layer comprises silicon nitride. </paragraph>

An appropriate process for transferring the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes reactive ion etching using SF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In order to protect the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during subsequent processing steps, a feature-protection layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is deposited, at step <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, on the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and on the exposed surfaces of the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> including the alignment cavities <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The feature-protection layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be conformally deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), for example. An appropriate choice for the feature-protection layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a material that may be selectively removed or retained as desired. It may be desirable to retain the feature-protection layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the final microchip to act as an antireflection coating. For example, a thin layer of silicon nitride, for example, 200 nm-500 nm thick, can serve as both an adequate protection coating and as an antireflection coating. The feature-protection layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can also comprise a CVD oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With the feature-protection layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in place, processing continues by applying, at step <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> barrier layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the feature-protection layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the barrier layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> encompass the regions of the alignment cavities <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the protective layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, but do not extend into the region containing the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In particular, it is desirable that the openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> be wider than the alignment cavities <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, to provide greater tolerance with which the openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the barrier layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be aligned with the alignment cavities <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A suitable material for the barrier layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is photoresist, which may be processed to form the structure depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in a manner similar to that described with respect to steps <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

An appropriate process for the removal of the portion of the feature-protection layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is reactive ion etching, similar to that described with respect to step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>.

The first protective layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> within the alignment cavities <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is then selectively removed, at step <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, to form alignment holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The removal of the first protective layer at the base of the alignment cavities <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> functions to expose the first surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the base of the alignment holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>.

The alignment holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> retain registration with respect to the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, because the alignment holes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the grayscale feature <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the surface of the substrate were defined by the same exposure step, step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

For example, wet anisotropic etching, such as etching by KOH, can be used to create micromachined features <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the form of V-shaped grooves or V-shaped pits in (100)-oriented Si, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> These and other advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing specification. Accordingly, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that changes or modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments without departing from the broad inventive concepts of the invention. For example, for the particular configuration illustrated herein, two micromachined features <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are provided. However a different number of micromachined features <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be created in accordance with the process of the present invention. Likewise, the process of the present invention is equally well suited to the creation of a plurality of grayscale features. Furthermore, the steps involving the removal of layers or materials may be accomplished by appropriate choices of wet or dry, isotropic or anisotropic etching. The addition of various layers of material in the process may be accomplished by methods such as spin coating, chemical vapor deposition, or physical vapor deposition.
