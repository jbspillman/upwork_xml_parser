<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for electrically stimulating select nerves to alter conditions within the heart, and, more particularly, to nerve stimulation to protect myocardium acutely, and to reduce anginal pain by stimulating subcutaneous tissue. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Various cardiac conditions, such as supraventricular arrhythmias, angina pectoris, and ventricular dysfunction or heart failure, have been treated by electrical stimulation of the spinal cord, vagus and other nerves. Typically, electrodes are implanted in the patient adjacent the spinal area and electrically excited to produce desirable effects on the functioning of the heart. For example, a paper entitled &ldquo;Vagal Tuning&rdquo; by Bilgutay et. al., published in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Vol. 56, No. 1, July 1968, pp. 71-82, discusses a system that delivers electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve using silastic coated, bipolar electrodes, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,421,511. The electrodes are surgically implanted around the intact nerve or nerves and a controlled current is delivered thereto. The electrodes pass the current to the nerve(s), producing a decreased heart rate while still preserving sinus rhythm in the patient. Low amplitude stimulation has also been employed to control induced tachycardias and ectopic beats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Angina pectoris and paroxysmal atrio-ventricular junctional or supraventricular tachycardias have also been treated by stimulating the carotid sinus nerve via implanted electrodes. For example, a paper entitled &ldquo;Carotid Sinus Nerve Stimulation in the Treatment of Angina Pectoris and Supraventricular Tachycardia,&rdquo; published in California Medicine, 112:41-50, March 1970, describes a system in which patients may electrically stimulate their carotid sinus nerve when they sense angina and/or supraventricular tachycardia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Delivery of electrical stimulation to the nervous system using an implanted electrode has been found particularly effective in the relief of chest pain, such as angina pectoris, that often accompanies myocardial ischemia. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,058,584 to Bourgeois, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses a system and method for treating such chest pain using electrical stimulation within the epidural space of the spinal cord. This treatment is provided only after a symptomatic level of activity is reached as sensed by an accelerometer or other activity sensor. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,058,331 to King, also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discusses a system and method for treating ischemia by automatically adjusting electrical stimulation to the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, or neural tissue ganglia based on a sensed patient condition. U.S. Pat. No. 5,199,428 to Obel et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses a system for stimulating the epidural space with continuous and/or phasic electrical pulses using an implanted pulse generator upon the detection of myocardial ischemia to decrease cardiac workload, and thereby reduce cell death related to the ischemic event. U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,021 to Rise, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discusses a system and method for providing spinal cord stimulation to relieve angina, and to further provide a patient notification that an ischemic event is occurring. This spinal cord stimulation is provided only after the ischemia is already detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-described systems, other systems have been disclosed to provide nerve stimulation following the onset of predetermined condition. U.S. Pat. No. 6,134,470 to Hartlaub describes a system for utilizing spinal cord stimulation to terminate tachyarrhythmias. The stimulation is provided only after the tachyarrhythmias, or a precursor thereto, has been detected. U.S. Pat. No. 3,650,277 discloses a system for stimulating the left and right carotid sinus nerves in response to the detection of elevated mean arterial blood pressure to alleviate hypertension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Each of the nerve stimulation systems described above have at least one significant drawback. For example, these nerve stimulation systems rely upon electrodes that are surgically implanted adjacent the spine, e.g., inside the vertebral canal. Successful placement of the electrodes in the region surrounding the spine requires substantial surgical expertise. Emergency personnel, however, do not commonly possess this expertise, nor do they often have the equipment or environment suitable for the task. Thus, while emergency personnel may be summoned to transport an afflicted patient to a hospital and, thus, are the first medical personnel to administer aid to the patient, they are generally not capable of implanting electrodes. Without the implanted electrodes, the therapeutic stimulation has not heretofore been available immediately. Rather, application of the therapy is delayed until the patient arrives at an appropriate medical facility. Furthermore, systems for chronic stimulation either have the drawback of requiring sophisticated implant techniques, or, for TENS, use electrodes that cause skin breakdown and other problems and inconvenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming, or at least reducing the effects of, one or more of the problems set forth above. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The current invention involves a neuromodulation system to provide stimulation to at least a portion of the nervous system of the body. The stimulation is provided using one or more subcutaneous electrodes or electrodes to stimulate peripheral nerves, intrinsic cardiac neurons, autonomic ganglia, and cranial nerves. The stimulation is provided in anticipation or detection of a cardiac insult, wherein &ldquo;cardiac insult&rdquo; in this context is intended to include, but is not limited to, angina, and mechanical, chemical, or electrical impairment or damage of cardiac tissue due to conditions such as heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ischemia, imbalance of autonomic tone, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the current invention provides a system and method to provide stimulation at locations adjacent the spinal cord and on the chest wall. Such stimulation has been shown to improve cardiac function, to limit ischemic attacks, to reduce sympathetic activity of the cardiac tissue, and to reduce the likelihood and/or the severity of ventricular arrhythmia. Thus, the electrical stimulation produces effects similar to those induced by prescription beta-blocker drugs. This type of stimulation has been shown to reduce cardiac work, improve heart function, vasodilate peripheral arterioles and increase blood flow to the limbs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, one or more electrodes may be placed subcutaneously adjacent one or more of the spinal vertebrae, with the T1-T4 locations being preferred, or subcutaneously near cervical nerves, with the C1-C3 location being preferred. Alternatively, the electrodes may be placed adjacent the chest wall or anywhere within a region of the T1-T5 spinal nerves, or adjacent to peripheral nerves such as the median or ulnarnerves, or cardiac fat pods, or sympathetic ganglia, or cranial nerves. The position of the electrodes may be, for example, in the pectoral region of the left chest located beneath the facia on the muscle and motor point of the pectoral muscle with stimulation of the musculocutaneous and thoracic nerves. In another example, the electrodes may be positioned in the auxiliary region beneath the left arm with stimulation provided to the musculocutaneous, brachialcutaneous and thoracodorsal nerves. In yet another embodiment, one or more subcutaneous electrodes are proximate to the external housing of an implanted device to stimulation nerves adjacent to the device. Because subcutaneous electrodes are utilized, a surgeon is not needed to position the electrodes in the patient&apos;s body. Rather, in one embodiment of the invention, a paramedic may position the one or more electrodes subcutaneously to initiate emergency treatment, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, the invention delivers electrical stimulation when the system is activated by a patient or other person such as a health care provider. For example, a medical care provider such as a paramedic may initiate stimulation to treat a patient that is having a heart attack. The patient himself may initiate such therapy if the onset of a heart attack is suspected. A patient may alternatively initiate stimulation in anticipation of undergoing exercise. A surgeon may initiate stimulation in anticipation of performing a surgical procedure such as the insertion of a stent, or any other procedure that may disrupt cardiac tissue. Nerve stimulation may be manually initiated by a paramedic after a high-voltage shock is delivered to a patient. Such stimulation stabilizes the heart and prevents the re-occurrence of fibrillation or an arrhythmia. Such stimulation may continue throughout the insult, and may optionally continue for a predetermined period of time following the insult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment, the inventive system may be operated in a closed-loop mode. In this mode, one or more physiological parameters may be sensed using physiological sensors. The sensed physiological signals may be used to predict or detect the onset of an insult. These signals may also be used to modulate delivery of the stimulation parameters such as pulse width, amplitude, frequency, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to yet another embodiment, the inventive system stores data signals indicative of past electrical stimulation so that future stimulation may be optimized. This stored data may also be used by healthcare professionals for treatment and diagnosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the instant invention, a method is provided for protecting cardiac tissue from insult. The method comprises identifying a future or current cardiac insult, and delivering subcutaneous electrical stimulation to one or more predetermined nerves in a patient&apos;s body in response to identifying the occurrence of the insult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the instant invention, an apparatus is provided for protecting cardiac tissue from insult. The apparatus is comprised of at least one electrode positionable subcutaneously and proximate nervous or muscle tissue, and a controller adapted to deliver electrical stimulation to the electrodes for a period of time in relation to the onset of an insult.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers&apos; specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Illustrative embodiments of a method and apparatus for providing improved cardiac function according to the present invention are shown in the Figures. As will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a complete reading of the present application, the present method and apparatus are applicable to a variety of systems other than the embodiment illustrated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiments, a method and apparatus for performing subcutaneous electrical stimulation to proactively modulate autonomic effects on the cardiovascular system is provided. Use of the stimulation minimizes arrhythmia, heart failure, and damage to cardiac myocytes due to the occurrence of a predicted and subsequent ischemic event.

As described in greater detail below, the current method and apparatus may employ a closed-loop control mechanism to initiate and regulate this stimulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Generally, the instant invention is directed to a method and apparatus for improving the efficiency of operation of the heart and may be used to reduce the likelihood of imminent cardiac insults. Therapeutic benefits associated with the instant invention may be derived from application of the instant invention to a wide variety of cardiac conditions. Thus, as used in the instant application, the phrase &ldquo;cardiac insult&rdquo; is intended to include, but is not limited to angina, and damage or mechanical, chemical, or electrical impairment of cardiac tissue due to conditions such as heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ischemia, imbalance of autonomic tone, or the like. In the illustrated embodiment, the current invention may also be utilized to treat ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, an external system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides stimulation to a patient <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at locations adjacent the spinal region and on the chest wall using leads <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively. The leads are each coupled to one or more subcutaneous electrodes, as will be discussed further below. Such stimulation has been shown to improve contractibility, to further improve the pressure-volume relationship within the heart, and to reduce sympathetic activity of the cardiac tissue to reduce the likelihood of ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, the electrical stimulation produces effects similar to those induced by prescription beta-blocker drugs. The stimulation may further cause the production of neuropeptides such as CGRP, NO, and VIP that are known vasodilators, which may assist in redirection of blood flow from regions of high flow to regions of low flow. This further improves the efficiency of the heart. In ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, this therapy may suppress or reduce subendocardial ischemia, and hence be cardio-protective. Electrical stimulation may further result in improvements in operational efficiency and function of cardiac tissue even in the presence of reduced blood supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When a subcutaneously-placed electrode is utilized, the electrodes may be placed adjacent any of the T1-T12 vertebrae or in any of the C1-C8 locations, and most preferably, any of the T1-T4 vertebrae (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). Alternatively, the electrodes may be placed adjacent the chest wall (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>), or spinal nerves, or adjacent to peripheral nerves such as the median or ulnarnerves, or cardiac fat pods, or sympathetic ganglia, or cranial nerves. The electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may take on any of a variety of forms of subcutaneous electrodes, as will be discussed further below. Conventional subcutaneous electrodes may be surgically inserted into the patient&apos;s body. In fact, subcutaneous stimulation may be provided using leads of the type that are commonly used for pacing the heart. The implantable electrodes may be placed subcutaneously to stimulate underlying muscles, overlying cutaneous nerves, passing somatic nerves, or a combination thereof. For example, various commercially available leads, such as the Pisces&reg;, Pisces Quad Plus &reg;, and Octad &reg; model leads, commercially-available from Medtronic Corporation, are examples of leads that may be used for this purpose. This subcutaneous placement may be desirable in emergency situations such as en route to a medical care facility following a heart attack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, subcutaneous electrodes may be carried on leads and inserted near nerve tissue using a delivery device such as a needle. In other instances, subcutaneous electrodes may be carried on the surface of an implanted medical device such as disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,292,336 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, such electrodes may be electrically-isolated from the can, as disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,331,966 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a paddle-type (flat) lead having a surface area between one square cm and five square inches or more may be used to accomplish the subcutaneous stimulation. Such a lead may be formed of an insulative material, with programmable electrodes on one or more of the flat sides of the lead for either skin stimulation, muscle stimulation, or both. According to this embodiment, the paddle-type lead may be between four and ten millimeters wide so as to be readily passable through a needle such as a twelve-gage needle before it unfolds. In one embodiment, the special delivery needle includes an oval or rectangular cross-section of appropriate size to allow for passage of the lead. Electrodes may be provided on one or both sides of the paddle lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, subcutaneous electrodes may be provided on both sides of the lead, with the electrodes employed for stimulation at a given time being selectively enabled by a user. Alternatively, the system may be programmable to select the type of tissue to be stimulated. This is desirable since in some vertebral instances, it may be beneficial to provide stimulation to only major nerves entering the column, whereas in other instances it may be desirable to also stimulate skin, muscle, or any combination of the nervous tissues. Various electrode combinations could be provided to allow for selective enabling of the stimulation in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> One or more subcutaneous electrodes are coupled to controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so that electrical signals supplied by the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> provide electrical stimulation to nervous tissue in the skin, muscle, or spinal canal of the patient. The controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may take the form of an external device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. This is useful in providing therapeutic signals to a patient who is anticipating exertion or any other type of event that may cause ischemia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In those situations in which a patient has a history of cardiac events, it is generally useful to construct the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in a housing <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> designed to be implantable within the human body, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, implanted lead <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is employed to deliver stimulation using a subcutaneous electrode that may be positioned under the skin using a &ldquo;tunneling&rdquo; approach. This housing may optionally include a pacing and/or cardioverter/defibrillator stimulation circuit for generating cardiac stimulation signals to the heart <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> using one or more leads <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, as is known in the art. Leads <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may carry one or more physiological sensors <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> for sensing physiological signals, as is discussed below. Additionally, or in the alternative, the housing may also include a drug delivery device such as a drug pump coupled to a drug delivery catheter that may be used with the nerve stimulation to prevent anticipated physiological insults. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be programmed for either automatic or manual operation. Manual activation of stimulation may be prompted by a variety of situations. For example, a medical care provider such as a paramedic may deliver one or more subcutaneous electrodes to an area proximate nerve tissue such as in the T1-T4 region, or in the area of referred pain, then initiate stimulation to treat a patient that is having a heart attack. A surgeon may likewise initiate this type of therapy prior to performing a surgical procedure such as the insertion of a stent, or any other procedure that may disrupt cardiac operation. Subcutaneous nerve stimulation may be manually initiated by a paramedic after a high-voltage shock is delivered to a patient. Such stimulation stabilizes the heart and prevents the re-occurrence of fibrillation or an arrhythmia. Any other anticipated or occurring cardiac insult may prompt a healthcare provider or patient to trigger controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to initiated stimulation via the one or more subcutaneously-placed electrodes. Such stimulation may continue throughout the insult, and may optionally continue for a predetermined period of time following the insult. Anticipatory delivery of cardiac stimulation has been determined by the Applicants to minimize damage of cardiac myocytes due to a subsequent ischemic event. These embodiments are based on data obtained through research conducted over several years involving electrical stimulation to reduce angina. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In another instance, subcutaneous stimulation could be provided at a sub-threshold level for paresthesia during the delivery of the defibrillation shock to reduce the perceived pain associated with the arrhythmia and the shock and stabilize the heart and help prevent re-occurrence of the arrhythmia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, subcutaneous electrical stimulation may be initiated prior to performing exercise, assuming a patient has an implantable medical device implanted within his body. Such stimulation appears to result in a short-term inhibition of the sympathetic outflow of the heart, which in turn causes changes in the neural chemistry in a manner that prevents damage from ischemic conditions. Stimulation may be provided for a predetermined length of time, which in one embodiment is approximately thirty minutes, shortly prior to performing the cardiac procedure or engaging in exercise. The amount of stimulation may also be selected based on the anticipated level of exertion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, subcutaneous electrical stimulation may be performed at upper cervical levels C1-C3 instead of at T1-T4. Although stimulation of this area has typically been performed to reduce jaw and neck pain or occipital neuralgia, it has been found such stimulation, can also reduce angina, and can provide important cardiac protection when performed prior to a cardiac insult. In yet another embodiment, stimulation may be performed at C2 and C3 instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, stimulation may be automatically initiated because of physiological measurements obtained by the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. That is, controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may utilize one or more conventional sensors such as sensors <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to sense signals that predict the possible on-set of physiologic conditions such as ventricular dysfunction, ischemia, heart failure, or any other type of cardiac insult. These sensors may be any of the types known in the art for sensing physiological signals, including pressure, oxygen, activity, temperature, and blood flow sensors. Exemplary sensors are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,903,701 issued to Moore et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,564,434, issued to Flalperin et al, U.S. Pat No. 4,428,378, issued to Anderson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,434, issued to Alt or U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,505, issued to Cohen, all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Upon anticipation or detection of the cardiac event, the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may automatically begin therapeutic treatment of the patient by subcutaneous electrically stimulating the selected nervous tissue(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment wherein controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is an external device, any type of external physiological sensor system known in the art may be utilized within the scope of the current invention. This may include, for example, externally-placed electrodes for measuring ECG signals in a manner known in the art. Other examples include pressure and temperature sensors, and/or sensors that may externally measure blood chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> After treatment is initiated, therapy may continue during an insult. Such stimulation could be continued until a cardiovascular intervention procedure is initiated, or even continued for several weeks past the incident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Generally, the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is comprised of one or more driver circuits <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and receiver circuits <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The driver circuits <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are generally responsible for providing the stimulating signals over the lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. That is, a processor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, operating under software or hardware control, may instruct the driver circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to produce a stimulating signal having a set of preselected, desired parameters, such as frequency, duty cycle, duration, waveform shape, amplitude, voltage and magnitude. As noted above, driver circuits <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may optionally include circuits <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to generate pacing and/or high-voltage stimulation to the heart on leads <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The receiver circuits <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are generally responsible for receiving signals from the sensors <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and processing those signals into a form, such as a digital format, which may be analyzed by the processor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and/or stored in a memory <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM). The memory <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may also store software, which is used to control the operation of the processor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment wherein controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is included in an implanted device, signals stored in memory <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may be transferred via a communication circuit <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> such as a telemetry circuit to an external device <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> such as a programmer. These signals may be stored in the external device, or transferred via a network <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> to a remote system <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> which may be a repository or some other remote database. Network <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> may be an intranet, internet system such as the world-wide web, or any other type of communication link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may further include a reed switch <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>. This type of switch mechanism may be closed using a magnet in the embodiment wherein the controller is implanted within a patient&apos;s body. Alternatively, another type of patient-activated mechanism such as an accelerometer <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> may be utilized for detecting a tapping sequence to activate the implantable embodiment of the invention. This type of tapping mechanism is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As noted above, controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may further include a drug delivery device <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> that may comprise a pump coupled to a catheter <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Exemplary implantable drug delivery systems that may be adapted to deliver biologically-active agents in conjunction with delivery of the subcutaneous stimulation are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,607,418, issued to Arzbaecher, U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,917, issued to Cammilli, U.S. Pat. No. 4,146,029, issued to Ellinwood and U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,505, issued to Cohen, all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As noted above, in one embodiment, delivery of the subcutaneous stimulation may be modified based on a variety of measurable physiologic parameters used in a closed loop control system. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C representative sensor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> may be positioned adjacent or within the body of the patient <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to sense various physiological conditions, which are communicated back to the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The measured physiological conditions may be used as an indication of the patient&apos;s response to the therapy being administered by the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. That is, a positive physiological response may be used as an indication that the therapy is achieving the desired result. The sensed physiological conditions may be used to adjust the parameters of the stimulation. For example, the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may measure and record cardiac pulse pressure. A change in the cardiac pulse pressure over time may be used in a closed-loop system to adjust delivery of stimulation. For example, if the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> detects that the cardiac pulse pressure has declined over time, then the parameters of the stimulation may be adjusted in an attempt to increase the cardiac pulse pressure. On the other hand, where the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> observes a consistent, appropriate cardiac pulse pressure, then the stimulation may be continued, as a desired result is being achieved by the stimulation. On the other hand, where the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> observes continued high, or even rising, cardiac pulse pressure, then the parameters of the stimulation may be adjusted in an attempt to lower the cardiac pulse pressure over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The overall general operation of the controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be appreciated by reference to a control diagram and flowchart depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the control diagram and flowchart illustrated herein may be used to represent either software that may be executed by the processor <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or hardware configured to operate to perform the functions set forth in the flowchart. Thus, either hardware or software may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the instant invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a generalized mode of closed loop operation. Through a sensor or combination of sensors, the system evaluates a physiologic state. This includes predicting (and later, detecting the continuation of) ischemia, an increased risk of VT/VF, a cardiovascular decompensation, and/or other types of cardiac insults to be discussed below. Any of the sensing systems listed below may be used to monitor physiological parameters to accomplish this function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In response to the detection of a particular physiologic state, the system adjusts the stimulation parameters to treat the detected or predicted abnormality. The system may also record trends in the sensed data and the effects or impact of a prior stimulation intervention. In one embodiment, the system may include an artificial intelligence system that allows the device to learn from the effectiveness of the prior therapy. The system thereby becomes customized to deliver therapy that is optimally tailored for the individual patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> After stimulation is initiated in response to an anticipated or detected insult, stimulation parameters may be adjusted. Such parameters may include stimulation pulse width, amplitude, frequency, duty cycle, and waveform shape. These parameters may be continually modified as the response is monitored so that the optimal treatment may be delivered. After the insult such as an ischemic episode has subsided, stimulation may be discontinued after an appropriate delay. A ramp-down process may be provided to allow for some hysteresis. Sensed data and device parameters may be transferred to an external device such as a programmer using a communication system such as a telemetry circuit. The physician may then evaluate the data and determine whether the delivered therapy requires modification, and whether it is desirable to enable the device to provide patient-initiated therapy in a manner to be discussed below. Additionally, the data may provide valuable information that may be used to deliver more effective manual therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one or more sensors shown as sensors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are used to measure physiologic conditions. The measured signals may be compared against a threshold value by one or more comparators <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The results of the comparisons may be summed, or otherwise processed, with the processed data set being provided on line <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. If this result indicates that electrical stimulation is required, as determined by block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, therapy is initiated. Therapy is initiated and controlled by a processing circuit, as represented by block <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. This processing circuit <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> provides the closed-loop feedback control used to modulate the level of therapy delivered. When therapy is to be discontinued, a ramp-down circuit shown in block <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> may be used to gradually discontinue the stimulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, artificial intelligence capability may be provided by the logic of block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. This artificial intelligence analyzes the effectiveness of previously delivered therapy to adjust current therapy delivery techniques. Therapy is thereby tailored to individual patient needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> According to another manner of initiating therapy, the signals provided by the sensors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be combined to generate a cumulative signal indicative of a patient&apos;s overall physiologic condition. This may be accomplished using a summation circuit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, for example. The cumulative signal may be provided along with, or in place of, the signal on the line <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> for use in determining whether therapy should be initiated or modulated. In addition to closed-loop operation, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also includes open-loop methods of initiating therapy, including patient-initiated therapy shown in block <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a flowchart representation of one embodiment of operating a closed-loop system according to the current invention. In block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> determination is made as to whether ischemia is anticipated. This determination is based on monitored physiological parameters that may include detection of physical activity, a change in the ST segment, change in paraspinal muscle tone, and/or a change in heart rate. Other parameters may be monitored in a manner to be discussed further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, electrical stimulation is provided when the tone in the paraspinal muscles is increasing, since this is an indicator of anticipated visceral complications. Detection of this increase in muscle tone could be accomplished using an externally-positioned strain gage, for example. Thus, electrical stimulation may be applied prior to the onset of actual ischemic so that cardiac tissue maybe protected in an anticipatory manner. Electrical stimulation may also continue while the muscle tone remains at a predetermined rigidity. In one embodiment, a rate-responsive sensor such as an accelerometer or other appropriate sensor may be used to sense the level of activity, and adjust the stimulation levels according to the activity level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> If ischemia is anticipated, and the stimulation has already been initiated as detected by block <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>, the stimulation level may be adjusted in block <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> based on the monitored parameters. This may include adjusting the rate, amplitude, duration, or waveform shape of electrical stimulation pulses applied to the electrodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. If stimulation has not yet been initiated, it may be activated in block <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight>. If artificial intelligence is provided, the level and/or type of stimulation may be correlated with the physiologic result of the stimulation so that therapy may be adjusted in the future. The stimulation may be modulated in block <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>, with the monitoring of patient condition continuing in block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. Stimulation may continue after the ischemia is actually detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> If ischemia is not anticipated and/or detected in block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, and stimulation is activated, as indicated by block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, stimulation may be discontinued, as shown in block <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment this may be accomplished using a timer and a ramp-down mechanism to gradually disable the stimulation therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As noted above, a closed-loop system may be utilized to control initiation and delivery of the subcutaneous electrical stimulation. The closed-loop system may utilize one or more physiological sensors known in the art to sense one or more physiological conditions that will be utilized to control therapy. Such sensors may include activity sensors, sensors for detecting cardiac electrical or mechanical activity, mechanisms for detecting autonomic activity or hemodynamic parameters, sensors for measuring blood chemistry, and mechanisms for tracking time-of-day. A partial exemplary listing of select types of sensing mechanisms that may be utilized in the closed-loop system for predicting cardiac insults are summarized in Table 1 below. The following table summarizes the types of sensors that may be employed to predict and/or detect a corresponding physiologic condition. Any one or more of the sensing devices and/or other sensing mechanisms known now or in the future for sensing physiological parameters may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the current invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In Table 1, column <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> lists general categories of sensors, column 2 corresponds to a particular physiologic parameter that may be monitored, column 3 outlines a corresponding sensor used to monitor the parameter, and column 4 relates to the type of physiologic condition or occurrence that may be anticipated using the measurement.

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, electrical stimulation is provided to peripheral nerves in dermatones T1-T12, C1-C8, or other areas of the spinal cord. Any combination of these sites may be stimulated. Such stimulation may involve electrodes implanted outside the vertebral canal at the desired location. In another embodiment, the vagus and/or peripheral nerve may be stimulated at various locations. If desired, stimulation may be provided subcutaneously located in the precordial area or over sites of the pain or any area from which nervous fibers project to the spinal cord at levels T1-T5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The sites of stimulation may include the following, with any combination being utilized: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> a. Nerves near the vertebral canal (T1- T12, preferably T1-T4; C1-C8); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> b. Vagus Nerve; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> c. Chest wall (precordial, near median nerve, toward muscle); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> d. Peripheral Nerve (median, peritoneal, ulnar, C2 and C3, ansa lenticularis, dorsal root ganglia); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> e. Carotid sinus, and other cranial nerves; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> f. Sympathetic ganglia; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> g. Intrinsic cardiac neurons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Electrical stimulation provides significant benefits when delivered prior to an anticipated cardiac insult, or an event that will induce ischemia. The benefits include minimizing or preventing acute infarct and reducing reperfusion arrhythmia. In one embodiment, the therapy is delivered thirty minutes or more prior to the anticipated on-set of an insult such as ischemia. As much as possible, the above therapies should be implemented prior to the insult. Some of the many exemplary embodiments included within the scope of the invention are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A through SE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating delivery of subcutaneous stimulation prior to planned cardiac interventions, like bypasses, angioplasties or stents (block <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>). The stimulation could be applied for a predetermined time such as 30-120 minutes prior to the intervention (block <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>). Stimulation may be continued for hours or days after the procedure to minimize adverse effects or to increase or even maximize patency of vessels (block <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating delivery of stimulation at a particular time of day (block <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). For example, stimulation may be provided when a patient wakes up in the morning. A timer may be utilized to initiate subthreshold stimulation, or alternatively, to initiate suprathreshold stimulation to provide paresthesia. After a predetermined time such as thirty minutes (block <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>), or when sensed physiological parameters indicate that the appropriate level of cardiovascular protection has been established (block <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>), the patient can be alerted (<highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>). This could be accomplished, for example, by use of stimulation producing a stronger paresthesia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating delivery of stimulation initiated because a patient anticipates physical activity and manually triggers therapy (block <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>). This may be accomplished using an externally-positioned magnet as may be used to close a reed switch. Alternatively, a tapping sequence may be initiated as is known in the art. In this embodiment, the P-<highlight><bold>9669</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>00</bold></highlight> PATENT patient performs a tapping action over the implanted device as may be accomplished using a finger. This tapping action is detected by an accelerometer or similar sensor within the device so that therapy may be initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an expected intensity of the activity or other optional parameters may also be specified (block <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>). After stimulation has been delivery for the specified time (block <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>) and/or after the appropriate level of cardio protection has been determined to have been established (block <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>), the device provides an indication that activity may be initiated (block <highlight><bold>528</bold></highlight>). Stimulation may continue throughout the activity, if desired (block <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating stimulation initiated at the first signs of activity in an anticipatory manner (block <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>), or at the first indication that ischemia, an episode of malignant ventricular arrhythmia, and/or any of the other insults discussed above may be anticipated (block <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>). This type of indication may be detected by one or more of the sensing mechanisms discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating stimulation initiated based on a real time recording of ischemic burden and total ischemic burden (blocks <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>). If desired, the prophylactic amount of stimulation could be increased if these measurements show increased ischemia in general, or an increased likelihood of the onset of ischemia (block <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</cross-reference> illustrates the delivery of the therapy for protection during a suspected heart attack. To promote optimal recovery, stimulation may be applied by healthcare professionals as soon as possible in an appropriate form if a heart attack is even suspected (blocks <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight>). This is done using transcutaneously-inserted subcutaneous electrode systems discussed above. This stimulation may continue after the symptoms subside to further protect the cardiac tissue (<highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The above-described closed-loop system may combine subcutaneous electrical stimulation with conventional drug therapy. The drug therapy may be provided by an implanted delivery device such as that discussed above, for example. The closed-loop system may be utilized to titrate the drug delivery and the stimulation in much the same manner as discussed above in conjunction with the closed loop electrical stimulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As discussed in detail above, one aspect of the inventive system and method provides a system and method for employing closed-loop controls to initiate and deliver subcutaneous electrical stimulation. However, as also indicated above, the invention may also be utilized in an open-loop mode wherein the stimulation is trigger by the patient or another person. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the system may also provide the ability for the patient to activate the stimulation based on the onset of a physical condition such as exertion or pain. Patient-initiated therapy may be limited or controlled by a programmable feature as specified by a physician. A timer may also be provided to initiate and control therapy at one or more times during the day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Any type of subcutaneous electrode system know in the art may be utilized with the scope of the current invention. In one embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, an electrode <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may be provided on a first and second side <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>B of a lead <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, with the electrodes <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> employed for stimulation at a given time being selectively enabled by a user. For example, the lead <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may be positioned subcutaneously with the first side <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>A positioned to face skin and the second side <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>B positioned facing the underlying muscle. The electrodes <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may then be selectively energized to stimulate nerve tissue in the skin, muscle, or both. Alternatively, the system may be programmable to select the type of tissue to be stimulated. This is desirable since in some instances, it may be beneficial to provide stimulation to only spinal neurons, whereas in other instances it may be desirable to also stimulate skin, muscle, or any combination of the nervous tissues. Various electrode combinations could be provided to allow for selective enabling of the stimulation in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the paddle-type lead may be between four and ten millimeters wide so as to be readily passable through a twelve-gage needle before it unfolds. That is, a special needle may be provided having an oval or rectangular cross-section of appropriate size to allow for the delivery of this type of lead. Electrodes may be provided on one or both sides of the paddle lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the case of an implantable device, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may have a plurality of electrodes <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> formed thereon or attached thereto. The housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may be positioned during implantation to excite skin, muscle, or both. In the illustrated embodiment, the implantable device also includes an optional accessory lead <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> with a plurality of electrodes <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> positioned thereon.
