<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method and apparatus for defect detection in a semiconductor structure having a plurality of self-aligned contacts. More specifically, it relates to detection of defects caused by the self-aligned contact etch process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Self-aligned contacts are typically utilized in densely packed array structures, such as a DRAM memory structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic side view of a partially fabricated self-aligned contact <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> prior to the self-aligned contact etch process. Initially, a source or drain <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed in a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such as silicon. A gate oxide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is then deposited over the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and source or drain <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is then formed from a conductive material, such as polysilicon or tungsten silicide. Dielectric or insulating spacers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are then formed and patterned around the gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A thin insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is then formed and patterned over the gate oxide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the spacers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the source or drain <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A dielectric layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, FSG, Low K) is then deposited over the gate oxide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the thin insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and the source or drain <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The dielectric layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is patterned for contact/via <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and etched such that a contact is formed to the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the gate oxide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The thin insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is typically formed from a material that serves as a barrier to the subsequent self-aligned contact etch process. For example, the barrier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is typically a nitride material (e.g., Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or SiON that is 30 to 40 nm thick), and the self-aligned contact etch is selected to not etch a nitride material. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates a diagrammatic side view of the self-aligned contact after the self-aligned contact etch process completes without etching through the thin insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As shown, the self-aligned contact etch process typically etches through the dielectric material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> but not the barrier material <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to form a via <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. That is, the etching process selectively etches the dielectric material <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> remains electrically isolated from the via <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as a result of the thin insulating layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A conductive plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is then deposited (e.g., by chemical or physical vapor deposition) into via <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The conductive plug may be any suitable conductive material, such as tungsten. A conductive line <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is then formed and patterned over the conductive plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. When the self-aligned contact etch process is selective, the gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> remains electrically isolated from the source or drain <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the conductive plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the conductive line <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic side view of a self-aligned contact <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&prime; with a barrier layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&prime; that has been breached by the self-aligned contact etch process. The barrier layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&prime; may be breached when the etching process fails to be selective. As a result of this failure, the gate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is now electrically coupled with the source or drain <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the electric plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>&prime;, and the conductive line <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Of course, this defect <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a killer defect since the transistor is no longer capable of functioning properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Several techniques are available for detecting defects caused by the self-aligned contact etch process. However, these techniques are typically performed after the wafer is removed from the fabrication line and after formation of the conductive lines (e.g., <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>) that tie the self-aligned contact structures together. In one technique, the wafer is probed off-line to determine whether the conductive lines are shorted to the gates. Large conductive pads are typically formed within this conductive layer to facilitate probing. Hence, this technique requires extra real estate in the form of probe pads for the probe testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another technique employs &ldquo;short loop&rdquo; wafers that are specifically designed to test a particular type of structure, such as a self-aligned contact structure. Short loop wafers are formed with a subset of fabrication steps. The subset of fabrication steps include key steps for forming the structure to be tested. For example, a &ldquo;gate short loop&rdquo; is formed from a patterned oxide layer and a patterned polysilicon layer. After the short loop wafer is fabricated, the resulting structures (e.g., gate structures) may then be tested via probing. This technique is extremely inefficient since extra masks are necessarily designed for the short loop wafer. Additionally, special process flows are required for the short loop wafer, in addition to the process flows required for the product wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Both techniques require that the particular structure be completely fabricated prior to testing. The probe technique waits for completion of the conductive lines, and the short loop technique waits for completion of the short loop wafer. Thus, the product remains at risk during these waits. That is, defects can only be detected after the structure is completely fabricated. If there is a problem in an initial process step, this problem is not caught until after several process steps are subsequently completed. Additionally, both techniques require off-line probing. A probe test is also typically performed on a chain of structures (e.g., self-aligned contact structures) and, hence, only indicates whether a defect is present (or how many defects are present within the chain) and does not indicate a defect&apos;s location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for improved apparatus and methods for detecting in-line defects in self-aligned contact structures and/or determining defect locations. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, mechanisms are provided for detecting defects (e.g., open and shorts) within a plurality of self-aligned contacts (e.g., that form part of an array structure) using voltage contrast techniques. For example, an electron beam is scanned over the self-aligned contacts to form an image from the resulting voltage potential formed on the self-aligned contacts. In one embodiment, each self-aligned contact include a via formed over a contact area (e.g., source or drain of a transistor), and the via remains unfilled during the voltage contrast test. A conductive line (e.g., gate of a transistor) with a surrounding thin barrier layer is patterned on a layer above and adjacent to each via and contact area. In this embodiment, the voltage contrast test is performed in-line prior to placement of conductive plugs within the vias. During the voltage contrast inspection, a via that has a significantly different potential than a majority of other vias is classified as a defect. For example, a different potential may occur when the thin barrier layer surrounding the conductive line has a breach that thereby exposes the conductive line to the electron beam. Other vias do not have a breach and therefore do not expose the conductive line to the electron beam. A location of the determined defects may also be provided from the position of the electron beam or position of the wafer stage when a defect is found. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the voltage contrast test is performed after conductive plugs are added to the vias. Once again, a significant potential difference on a selected via and conductive plug, as compared to a majority of scanned vias and plugs, is classified as a defect. The location of such defect may also be found from the position of the electron beam when it scans over a via having a significantly different potential (or from a position of the wafer stage). In another embodiment, the voltage contrast inspection is performed after formation of a second layer of conductive lines over the vias. In one embodiment, the voltage contrast inspection is performed on a product self-aligned contact structure. In one aspect, the self-aligned contact structure is a dummy structure that is coupled with a product structure. Alternatively, the voltage contrast inspection is performed on a test structure that mimics the product structure and is on the product wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a method of detecting defects in a plurality of self-aligned contacts on a partially fabricated semiconductor device is disclosed. Each self-aligned contact includes a via. A charged particle beam is scanned over the vias to form a voltage contrast image of each via. When a minority of the vias in the image have a significantly different brightness level than a majority of the vias, it is then determined that the minority of vias have defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a specific inspection implementation, each via is unfilled. In one aspect, each self-aligned contact includes a first layer with a plurality of contact portions, a second layer with a plurality of conductive lines that are each aligned proximate to an associated underlying contact portion, and a third insulating layer formed over the conductive lines and their proximate underlying contact portions. The vias are formed within the third insulating layer, alongside a one of the conductive lines, and over its proximate underlying contact portion. Each defect is then in the form of a breach in the insulating layer over a one of the conductive lines so that the conductive line is exposed to the particle beam as it scans over the associated via, as compared with another of the conductive lines that is not defective and has the insulating layer disposed between itself and the associated via so as to form a barrier against the particle beam. In another embodiment, a location of each defect is determined from a position of the charged particle beam when each defective via is imaged(or from a position of the wafer stage. The position is correlated to a position on the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the scanning is performed in-line with fabrication of the semiconductor device. The self-aligned contacts may form part of product structure on a product wafer and may be arranged in an array structure. Each contact portion may form a source or drain of a transistor, and each proximate conductive line may form a gate of the transistor separated from the proximate contact source/drain by an oxide layer and the third insulating layer. The third insulating layer may include a plurality of dieletric spacers with a pair of spacers being on each side of each gate, a barrier layer over each pair of spacers, and an interlayer dielectric layer formed over the barrier layer and contact portions. The vias are formed by an etch process that is selected to etch through the interlayer dielectric layer and not the barrier layer. Each defect is in the form of a breach in the barrier layer over a one of the conductive lines so that the conductive line is exposed to the particle beam as it scans over the associated via, as compared with another of the conductive lines that is not defective and has the barrier layer disposed between itself and the associated via so as to form a barrier against the particle beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, a conductive plug is provided within each via. Each defect may be in the form of a breach in the insulating layer over a one of the conductive lines so that the conductive line is shorted to the associated conductive plug. Alternatively, each defect is in the form of a open defect within the conductive plug where a top surface of the conductive plug is not electrically coupled with its associated underlying contact portion. The conductive plug may be formed from a fuse material, and each conductive plug is fused prior to scanning the via. Alternatively, the conductive plug is formed from a anti-fuse material, and the anti-fuse plugs are deactived after they are scanned. In one embodiment, the self-aligned contacts form dummy structures that are coupled with a product array of self-aligned contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a further method implementation, conductive plugs within each via and a fourth layer having a plurality of conductive lines that are each coupled to a one of the conductive plugs are provided. A charged particle beam is scanned over a portion of the fourth layer of conductive lines to form a voltage contrast image of each conductive line portion. When a minority of the conductive line portions in the image have a significantly different brightness level than a majority of the conductive line portions, it is determined that the minority of conductive line portions have defects. In one aspect, the second layer of conductive lines form a plurality of word lines within a memory array, and the fourth layer of conductive lines form a plurality of word lines within the memory array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, a method of detecting defects in a plurality of fabricated self-aligned contacts on a semiconductor device is disclosed. Each self-aligned contact includes a via filled with a conductive plug that is coupled to a conductive line. A charged particle beam is scanned over a portion of the conductive lines to form a voltage contrast image of each conductive line portions. When a minority of the conductive line portions in the image have a significantly different brightness level than a majority of the conductive line portions, it is determined that the minority of conductive line portions have defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a inspection system for detecting defects in a plurality of self-aligned contacts on a partially fabricated semiconductor device on a semiconductor device is disclosed. Each self-aligned contact includes a via. The system includes a beam generator for generating a charged particle beam and directing it towards the self-aligned contacts. The system further includes a detector for detecting charged particles emitting from the self-aligned contacts in response to the generated charged particle beam and a processor and memory arranged to cause the beam generator to scan a charged particle beam over a portion of the vias to form a voltage contrast image of each via and determine that the minority of vias have defects when a minority of the vias in the image have a significantly different brightness level than a majority of the vias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention pertains to a computer program product for detecting defects in a plurality of self-aligned contacts on a partially fabricated semiconductor device on a semiconductor device using an inspection system is disclosed. Each self-aligned contact includes a via. The computer program product includes at least one computer readable medium and computer program instructions stored within the at least one computer readable product configured to cause the inspection system to perform one or more of the above described methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a test structure is disclosed. The test structure includes a first plurality of conductive lines, a second plurality of conductive lines orthogonal to the second conductive lines, and a plurality of self-aligned contacts that are designed to be coupled to the first conductive lines and not the second conductive lines. The first conductive lines are on a different level than the second conductive lines. The test structure forms part of a product wafer and is designed to mimic an array structure having self-aligned contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a specific implementation, the second conductive lines are at a floating potential and the first conductive lines are at a predetermined potential. In another embodiment, the first and second conductive line mimic bit lines and word lines, respectively, of a memory device. In one aspect, the test structure is a dummy structure coupled to a product structure comprising self-aligned contacts. In a further implementation, the self-aligned contacts of the test structure are filled with an anti-fuse material that may be deactivated after inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be presented in more detail in the following specification of the invention and the accompanying figures which illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to a specific embodiment of the invention. An example of this embodiment is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with this specific embodiment, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to one embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. The present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The detection techniques of the present invention may be applied to any type of structure having a plurality of self-aligned contacts. The structure may form part of a product structure or a test structure on the product wafer that mimics a product structure. For simplicity, the techniques of the present invention are illustrated using DRAM devices formed from a plurality of self-aligned contacts. Other suitable memory devices include, but are not limited to, SRAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory. Other suitable devices, besides memory, include a gate array, sea-of-gates, microprocessor, micro-controller, and micro-electromechanical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of an array of DRAM cells <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that may be formed from self-aligned contacts. The DRAM array <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> contains a plurality of bit lines <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a plurality of word lines <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Each DRAM cell (e.g., <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>) includes a transistor. Each transistor has a source or drain that is coupled to a capacitor, while the other side of the transistor is coupled to a bit line <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The gate of the transistor is coupled to a word line (e.g., <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When the etching process has succeeded in being selective and has not etched through the barrier layer, the word lines and bit lines are electrically isolated from each other as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a plurality of DRAM cells <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&prime; with a defective DRAM cell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that has failed during a self-aligned contact etch process. In this failed cell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, bit line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is electrically shorted to word line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> illustrate a scan of a plurality of self-aligned contacts having no defects in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Typically an inspection system is set up to scan a charged particle beam, such as an electron beam in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or an e-beam review or inspection system, in direction <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it. For example, the electron beam is rastered across a swath as the self-aligned contacts are moved in direction <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it. In the illustrated embodiment, the swath is three self-aligned contact wide. However, the electron beam may be scanned relative to the self-aligned contacts in any suitable direction so that a portion of the self-aligned contacts are scanned by the electron beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows a top view of the self-aligned contacts, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is a cross section A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. As shown, a row of self-aligned contacts are coupled to a word line <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and another row is coupled to word line <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The first row includes self-aligned contacts <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The second row includes self-aligned contacts <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> During this inspection, each self-aligned contact includes an unfilled via formed within a dielectric or insulating layer <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and positioned over a contact portion <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> (e.g., a source or drain of a DRAM cell transistor) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. That is, the via has not yet been filled with a conductive plug (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). Accordingly, the electron beam is scanned over each unfilled vias. After or during the electron beam scan, each via will have a specific potential that may be indicated as a particular brightness level within an image generated from charged particles, such as secondary or backscattered electrons, emitted from the self-aligned contacts. These electrons are generated in response to the scanning electron beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> When there is no defect present within the scanned self-aligned contacts, they tend to have about the same potential level. In other words, the electrons will tend to be absorbed or emitted in a similar manner when there is no defect present within the self-aligned contacts. When there is not a significant difference in potential or brightness level among the scanned vias, it is determined that the self-aligned contacts do not contain defects. However, a defective self-aligned contact will have different potential than the nondefective contacts. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> illustrate a scan of a plurality of self-aligned contacts having a defect in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a top view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a cross section B-B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. The electron beam scans relative to the self-aligned contacts in direction <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When there is a defect present in one of the self-aligned contacts, the potential and brightness level of the defective contact significantly differs from the other non-defective self-aligned contacts. For example, an image of contact <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a dark portion <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (e.g., from exposed gate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) that indicates a defect, while the contact <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>does not contain a dark portion. In one embodiment, when a minority of the self-aligned contact have a brightness that is 5 to 100% different than the majority of self-aligned contacts, it is determined that the minority self-aligned contacts have defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, self-aligned contact <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is in the form of an unfilled via that is proximate to an exposed gate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a transistor. For example, the thin insulating barrier layer that typically surrounds the gate has been inadvertently etched away during formation of the self-aligned contact via <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When the via and exposed gate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are bombarded by electrons within the beam, the gate charges differently than the vias which do not have an exposed gate. Of course, the via may contain any type of exposed conductive line surrounded by any type of insulating layer, instead of an exposed gate and barrier layer of a transistor, and such exposed conductive line will tend to charge differently than other vias without exposed conductive lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the exposed gate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>repels or emits more or less electrons than other self-aligned contacts with unexposed gates. In the DRAM example, the gates are typically formed from a conductive material that acts as a source of secondary electrons and appears bright (depending on the SEM configuration) of the via <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In contrast, the unexposed gate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>does not serve as an electron source since it is not exposed to the beam. Additionally, the other via components are formed from an insulating material (e.g., the insulating barrier layer and the dielectric layer) that is at a floating potential. These types of structures tend to charge up and not result in as many secondary electrons as the defective via. For example, the defective exposed gate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will appear bright, and the unexposed gates (e.g., <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) will appear dark. For illustrative purposes, the defects are shown and described as having a dark appearance, although they tend to have a brighter appearance than the nondefective vias or contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A voltage contrast inspection allows one to determine the location of each defect. For example, the inspection tool tracks each self-aligned contact&apos;s position as the electron beam is scanned over the self-aligned contacts. When a defect is found, the coordinates of the electron beam or sample stage correspond to a location on the scanned sample. Thus, the location of the defect may be easily determined by the electron beam system and/or the wafer stage location. Knowing the locations of each defect facilitates further analysis of the root cause of the failure (e.g., process to tool integration). Such analysis will likely result in an accelerated yield ramp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, defect detection may be performed immediately following the self-aligned contact etch process prior to filling the self-aligned contact vias with a conductive via and adding a second layer of conductive lines of the plugs. The promptness of the inspection and the ability to detects defects significantly reduces the product at risk time delta. The saving in elapsed time can be in the order of several days and hence reduces the risk of lost products because of yield loss. These savings in time and yield translate into significant cost savings. Additionally, the inspection is done in-line as part of the process flow. That is, the product is not removed from the clean room and can therefore, continue to be processed or reworked (if needed). Additionally, voltage contrast testing is contact-free and therefore does not require extra probe pads to inspect the self-aligned contact structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> illustrate a top view and side view, respectively, of a scan of a plurality of self-aligned contacts having no defects after conductive plugs <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> have been inserted in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> is a cross section B-B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. The electron beam scans relative to the self-aligned contacts in direction <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it. When the non-defective plugs <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are scanned, they tend to have about the same potential and resulting image brightness levels. When there is not a significant difference in potential among the scanned vias and their associated conductive plugs, it is determined that the self-aligned contacts do not contain defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> illustrate a top view and cross sectional view, respectively, of a scan of a plurality of self-aligned contacts after conductive plugs <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> have been inserted having a defect in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> is a cross section A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. The electron beam scans relative to the self-aligned contacts in direction <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it. The self-aligned contacts are scanned with an electron beam in direction <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it. As shown, conductive plug of self-aligned contact via <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has a different potential or brightness level than the other conductive plugs (e.g., <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) without defects. When a scanned contact via has a significantly different potential or brightness level than a majority of the other scanned vias, it is considered to have a defect. In one embodiment, when a minority of the self-aligned contacts have a brightness that is 5 to 100% different than the majority of self-aligned contacts, it is determined that the minority self-aligned contacts have defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the conductive plug <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has shorted to the gate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>thereby causing a defect. When an electron beam scans over the defective plug <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, it produces more or less secondary electrons than the non-defective plugs (e.g., <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). Hence, an image of the defective conductive plug has a brighter or darker intensity than the non-defective plugs. The imaged defect area is larger when the vias are filled with conductive material than when they are left unfilled. Thus, defects are more easily recognized after the conductive plugs have been inserted within the vias. However, this process requires more time before defects are detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> illustrate a top view and cross sectional view, respectively, of a scan of a plurality of self-aligned contacts after a plurality of conductive lines <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> are patterned over the self-aligned contact vias in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is a cross section A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. The electron beam scans relative to the self-aligned contacts in direction <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it. However, the beam may be scanned in a direction perpendicular to direction <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it across a portion of the conductive lines <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. For example, the ends of the conductive lines may be scanned. In the illustrated embodiment, the self-aligned contacts do not contain defects. When the nondefective conductive lines <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> are scanned with an electron beam, they will all appear to have the same approximate potential or brightness value. When there is not a significant difference in potential or brightness among the scanned conductive lines <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, it is determined that the self-aligned contacts do not contain defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> illustrate a scan of a plurality of self-aligned contacts having a defect. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> is a cross section B-B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. The electron beam scans relative to the self-aligned contacts in direction <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> or orthogonal to it. When there is a defect in any of the self-aligned contacts, its associated conductive line <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> will have a significantly different potential or brightness level than the non-defective conductive lines. As shown in the top view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, conductive line <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>appear dark, while conductive lines <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>appear bright. Thus, conductive line <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>would be classified as having a defect. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the conductive line <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is coupled to conductive plug <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which is shorted to gate <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As in the previous embodiments, when a minority of the self-aligned contacts have a brightness that is 5 to 100% different than the majority of self-aligned contacts, it is determined that the minority self-aligned contacts have defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As described above, the self-aligned contacts being inspected may form part of a product structure. The self-aligned contacts may form active components in a product structure or form dummy component in a product structure. In one embodiment, dummy self-aligned contacts may be deactivated by applying a high voltage or high energy pulse to the conductive plug after the self-aligned contacts are inspected. The high voltage or energy pulse generally vaporizes the conductive plug. Of course, any mechanisms may used to blow or deactive the plug and depend on the type of anti-fuse material used. Alternatively, the plugs may be formed from fuse type material. For example, the vias are filled with weak conductive material, such as amorphous silicon or undoped polysilicon. The plugs may be fused by applying a heat pulse or an electron beam to spot anneal the plug. The application of a heat pulse transforms the weak conductive plug into a strong conductive plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The self-aligned contacts may also form a test structure that mimics a product structure. The test structure is formed on a product wafer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic top view representation of a test structure <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In general terms, the test structure <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> mimics an array of self-aligned contacts. However, the test structure may mimic any product structure having a plurality of self-aligned contacts. As shown, the test structure <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of self-aligned contacts <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> associated with word lines <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and bit lines <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. Of course, the word lines and bits lines may represent any form of conductive lines when mimicking a different type of product structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the word lines <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and bit lines <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> are arranged orthogonal to each other. Similar to a product self-aligned contact array, the word lines <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> are designed to be floating, while the bit lines <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> are designed to be at a predetermined voltage, such as ground <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the bit lines <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> are tied together. However, other test structure embodiments may include bits lines that are individually tied to ground or another potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> If the test structure is properly formed, the bit lines will appear to have a particular intensity, while the word lines will charge differently than the bits lines when scanned with an electron beam. In a generated image, the word lines will appear to have a different brightness than the word lines. Said in another way, the bit lines will have a same first intensity that differs from a second intensity of the word lines. In one embodiment, an electron beam scans in direction <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> (or orthogonal to it) over the end portions <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> of word lines <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. If a self-aligned contact within a particular word line <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> contains a defect, its end portion <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> will have a significantly different potential and brightness value (e.g., greater than 5 to 100%) than the non-defective end portions. As shown, word line <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>appears darker than the other word lines <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. A defect may occur when a word line is shorted to a bit line. As shown, bit line <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is shorted to word line <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Hence, self-aligned contact <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is determined to be defective. Since this test structure is formed in a similar manner as the above describe product structures, defects may be found prior to filling the self-aligning contacts with a conductive plug or prior to placement of the conductive line (e.g., <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>) using the same above described techniques as used for the product structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Any other suitable type of test structure may be configured to mimic self-aligning contacts. Several inventive test structures designed by the present assignee are disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/648,093 (Attorney Docket No. KLA1P016A) by Satya et al., filed Aug. 25, 2000, which application is incorporated herein in its entirety. An alternative to the test structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. As shown, the test structure is a comb type test structure having a first plurality of conductive lines <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> shaped into a comb and a second plurality of conductive lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight>. The first set of lines <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> are interleaved with the second set of lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the first set of lines <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> are designed to be coupled to ground, while the second set of lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> are designed to be floating. The first set of lines mimic bit lines <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight>, while the second set <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> mimic word lines (or gates). There is a dielectric or insulating material between the bit lines <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> and word lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight>. A plurality of self-aligning contacts <highlight><bold>954</bold></highlight> are associated with the first set of lines <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> in an array pattern to mimic, for example, a memory structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the top portion <highlight><bold>958</bold></highlight> of the lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> may be scanned by an electron beam in direction <highlight><bold>958</bold></highlight>. When the electron beam moves across these lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight>, the lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> are expected to have the same intensity value when there is no defect present. However, if two adjacent lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> are shorted together, the shorted line <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> will have a different intensity than the other nondefective lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight>. As shown, a short <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> is present between lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. Thus, line <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>has a different intensity value than other nondefective lines <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight> (e.g., <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and line <highlight><bold>964</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>is classified as defective. Since this test structure is formed in a similar manner as the above describe product structures, defects may be found prior to filling the self-aligning contacts with a conductive plug or prior to placement of the conductive line (e.g., <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight>) using the same above described techniques as used for the product structures. </paragraph>
