<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an air brush and more particularly to an air brush having an adjusting function in which the discharge of coating material is adapted to be kept constant by restricting the pulling position of an operating lever. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Among conventional air brushes, there is an air brush as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This air brush <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> having a nozzle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> provided at a tip end thereof for spraying coating material, and a needle <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> inserted into an axial core section of the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> so as to slidably advance and retract along the axial core section of the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. At a middle part of the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, an operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is provided. By depressing the operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an air valve <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is opened. When the air valve <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is opened, compressed air which is supplied from an air supplying port <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> connected to a lower portion of the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is adapted to be introduced into an air passageway <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and blew off from the air nozzle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, in the air brush <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, when the operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is depressed as described above, the blowing-off of the compressed air from the nozzle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> starts and, when the operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is pulled rearward of the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from the situation, a needle chuck <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is retreated through an operating plate <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> which is bent into a substantially S-shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> By the retreating of the needle chuck <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, a tip end of the needle <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> chucked by the needle chuck <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is retreated, thereby opening the nozzle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Upon the opening of the nozzle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, liquid coating material which is sucked up from a container <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> with the foregoing blowing-off of the compressed air is blew off in a finely atomized state from the opened nozzle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. That is, the depressing of the operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> causes the blowing-off of the compressed air to start and the rearward pulling of the operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> causes the coating material to be blew off. Also, according to the pulling amount of the operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the amount of the coating material discharging from the nozzle is controlled so as to increase or decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned air brush <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has an adjusting screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> threadedly mounted on a rear end of the needle chuck <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for fastening and releasing a chucking portion of the needle chuck. The above-mentioned adjusting screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> serves as means to adjust a chucking position at which the needle <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is chucked by the needle chuck <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. For example, the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is loosened and the needle <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is slid rearwardly in a predetermined amount and, thereafter, the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is again tightened, whereby the nozzle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be always kept opened in a predetermined amount in state where the operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> remains unpulled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the state as described above, when the operating lever <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is depressed (is not pulled rearwardly), it is possible to always blow off a certain amount of coating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, when the blowing-off amount of the coating material is to be kept constant as described above, it is necessary to perform the following operation. That is, after a cap member <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> which is threadedly mounted in the rear end of the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is removed from the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the needle <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is adjusted, the cap member <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is again mounted in the air brush body <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Thus, the operation is troublesome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, among conventional air brushes, an air brush with an adjusting mechanism has been developed in the background of the above problem (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the air brush <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a hollow cap member <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is threadedly connected to a rear end portion of an air brush body <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and an adjusting finger-grip <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for adjusting coating material is threadedly mounted in a rear end portion of the hollow cap member <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The adjusting finger-grip <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> comprises a gripping portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>projecting outwardly from a rear end opening of the cap member <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, a threaded portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>threadedly mounted in the cap member <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> through the rear end opening of the cap member <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and a pipe-like abutting portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which is formed integrally with an end of the threaded portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and projects from the end of the threaded portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>toward an adjusting screw <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The air brush is constructed such that in situation where the finger-grip <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is mounted in the cap member <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> as described above, when the adjusting finger-grip <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is rotated, the abutting portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is advanced or retreated in an axial core direction of the air brush body and, when an operating lever <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is pulled, a rear end surface of a retreated adjusting screw <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is abutted against a front end surface of the abutting portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, thereby limiting the retreating amount of a needle <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> That is, in the air brush <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> constructed as described above, by the rotational operating of the finger-grip <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the front end of the abutting portion <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is moved in the axial core direction, and a position at which the adjusting screw is abutted against the abutting portion when the operating lever is pulled, namely, a retreating position of the needle, is determined, whereby discharging of a certain amount of coating material can be always performed. Therefore, the air brush <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can use the adjusting function by adjusting the rotation of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, without the laborious work of removing the cap member when the retreating position of the needle <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is adjusted. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As described above, the air brush <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can easily carry out the adjusting operation of the retreating position of the needle <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. However, the construction of the air brush <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> requires the finger-grip <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> which is threadedly mounted in the rear opening of the cap member <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, so that the number of parts is increased and assembling steps are increased, resulting in additional manufacturing cost being incurred, as compared to the air brush <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> including the cap member <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide, in connection with such an air brush as stated above, an arbitrarily adjusting function of the retreating position of the needle without incurring the additional manufacturing cost, and to easily carry out discharging of a certain amount of coating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To attain the above object, the air brush according to the present invention includes a substantially cylindrical air brush body having a nozzle provided at a tip end thereof. Inserted into an axial core section of the air brush body is a needle for opening and closing the nozzle which is inserted into and held by a needle chuck which is mounted in the air brush body along the axial core section of the air brush body. Therefore, the needle chuck can hold at a predetermined position the needle inserted therein, and release the needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The needle chuck is supported, so as to advance and retract in an axial direction, by an operating lever provided at the air brush body. When the operating lever is operated rearwardly and the needle chuck is retreated, a tip end of the needle is retreated from the nozzle and the nozzle is opened, whereby discharging of coating material is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Projecting rearwardly of the rear section of the air brush body are a chuck adjusting screw for adjusting the needle chuck so as to tighten and loosen the needle chuck and a rear section of the needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A cap member is removably and threadedly connected to the rear section of the air brush body. When the cap member is threadedly connected to the rear section of the air brush body as described above, the adjusting screw and the rear section of the needle are housed in the cap member and covered by the cap member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the needle chuck is retreated by the operation of the operating lever, the needle and the chuck adjusting screw are integrally retreated. Provided in an interior of the cap member is an abutting portion. When the needle chuck is retreated by the operation of the operating lever as described above, an end of the chuck adjusting screw is abutted against the abutting portion in the cap member, whereby further retreating of the needle chuck is prevented. That is, by rotating the cap member to cause the cap member to be moved in the axial core direction, the retreating position of the needle is fixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Therefore, by rotational operating of the cap member to cause the position of the abutting portion to be moved in an axial direction within the predetermined range, a position (retreating limit) at which the chuck adjusting screw mounted to a rear end of the needle chuck is abutted against the abutting portion is adjustingly moved, and the discharge of coating material from the nozzle is adjustably increased and reduced when the operating lever is operated to the retreating limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the air brush according to second aspect of the present invention will be discussed with reference to the following detail description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention will be discussed with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An airbrush illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an example to which the present invention is applied, in which the air brush is constructed such that a nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acting as a blowing port to cause a compressed air and liquid coating material to blow off is provided at a tip end of an air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed into a substantially cylindrical shape, a needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for opening and closing the nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is inserted into the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to slidably advance and retract along an axial core section and, by operating an operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to cause the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be retreated, liquid coating material supplied from a coating material container <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> provided at a front section of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is blew off together with the compressed air from the nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A connecting pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> acting as a connecting port to which a compressed air supplying horse <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is adapted to be connected is threadedly connected to a forked portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provided at a middle section of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and an air valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided within the connecting pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The air valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed so as to be opened by depressing the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the air valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is opened, a compressed air flows into the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the connecting pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> acting as an air supplying port, passes an air passageway <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> provided in the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and blows off from the nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a pushing lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connected through an axle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to a tip end thereof and the pushing lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is mounted in an axial core section of the forked portion <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, whereby the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is depressibly supported. Also, the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is adapted to be bendable from the axle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is tilted rearwardly by pulling operation. Incidentally, a tip end of the pushing lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is coupled to the air valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and, the air valve <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is opened by the depressing operation of the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, whereby the supply of the air is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is inserted into the axial core section of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supported in state where it is inserted into a needle chuck <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> mounted in an axial core section of a rear portion of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The needle chuck <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> chucks and supports the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to allow the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to advance and retract in an axial direction, and is formed into a substantially pipe-shape. Also, the needle chuck <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is mounted in the axial core section of the rear portion of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to be slidably advanced and retreated relative to the axial core section, and is supported with a rear end portion thereof slightly projecting from a rear end of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Also, an adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is threadedly mounted on the rear end portion of the needle chuck <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which projects from the rear end of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, by tightening the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a caliber of the rear end opening of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is reduced, and the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is adapted to fasten and hold the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inserted through a bore of the needle chuck <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is held with a rear end portion thereof extending rearwardly from the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The needle chuck <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is always urged forwardly by an elasticity of a spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provided at the middle section of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Also, an actuating plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is bent and formed into a substantially S-shape is provided between a front end of the needle chuck <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is pulled rearwardly against the elasticity of the spring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and tilted, the chuck <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are slid rearwardly through the actuating plate <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> provided at the tip end of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is opened, and the coating material which is sucked up from the container <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is discharged from the nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Namely, the air brush is constructed such that the depressing of the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> causes the jetting of the compressed air from the nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to start and the rearward pulling and tilting of the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> causes the coating material to blow off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for covering the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the rear portion of the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the rear end of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical body, a rear end of which is closed, and an opened front end of which has a threaded portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> formed at an outer periphery thereof which is to be threadedly mounted in the rear opening of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, an inner periphery of the rear opening of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed with a threaded opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in which the threaded portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is to be threadedly mounted. The threaded portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is threadedly mounted in the threaded opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, whereby a connecting section a detachably interconnecting the both elements <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is threadedly mounted on the connecting section a and, when the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is threadedly connected to the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is interposed between the end surfaces of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, a width b of the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in an axial core direction is set to become slightly wider than a retreating amount c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime; of the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is completely pulled (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Incidentally, the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is used when the air brush of the present invention is used as a normal air brush which does not have the adjusting function. Also, when the air brush is used to take advantage of the adjusting function, the air brush is used in state where the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is removed from the air brush (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, an inserting bore <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided in an interior of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to extend along a core section of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a rear portion of the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which projects from the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is inserted in the inserting bore <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. That is, when the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is operated, the rear portion of the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> moving along the axial core forwardly and rearwardly moves along the interior of the inserting bore <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Further, the interior of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided at a position positionally corresponding to an origin end of the inserting bore <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> with an abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> against which an end of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is abutted. When the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is pulled to cause the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to be retreated and the end of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is abutted against the abutted portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> serves to limit the retreating of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed as a surface perpendicular to the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a predetermined position in the interior of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In state where the threaded portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is mounted and completely screwed into the threaded opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as described above, that is, in state where the end of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is abutted against the abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (in condition where the operating lever is at an initial point and is not retreated at all (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>)), the position of the abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided in the interior of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is set so as to allow a slight space b<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, e.g., a space of a little less than 1 mm between a side edge of the base end of the threadedly engaging portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an opening edge portion of the threadedly engaging portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this connection, the space b<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serves as a margin required for assembling of the air brush and the adjusting and a size of the space varies with a dimensional error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the spraying of the coating material is carried out while keeping the discharge of the coating material from the nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> constant, the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is rotated from the above condition in such a direction as to be loosened, to thereby cause the abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be retreated. According to this, the abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is retreated from the end of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and an arbitrary space <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(e.g., 0.1-2 mm or so) is produced between the end of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The space c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponds to the retreating amount of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the needle <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> upon the complete pulling of the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the nozzle <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is opened by an amount corresponding to the space c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is kept completely pulled, whereby a certain amount of the coating material is sprayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Further, by the operatively rotating of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the space c between the end of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is increased or reduced, it is possible to arbitrarily set the spraying amount of the coating material, and by pulling of the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to a ultimate retreating position, it is possible to exhibit techniques such as the spraying of the same thick lines of the coating material, spot-blowing of the coating material and the spraying of camouflage lines of the coating material while keeping the spraying amount of the coating material constant, and it is possible to reflect the techniques in a work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Also, when the air brush is used as a normal air brush which does not have the adjusting function, the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is threadedly mounted on and exists at the connecting section a between the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). This will cause the space c<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the end of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to exceed the moving distance of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> retreated by the pulling of the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so that the operating lever <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be ultimately pulled and the air brush can be unchangingly used as compared to the normal air brush. Further, in situation where the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is threadedly mounted on the connecting section a and interposed between the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, any space is not produced at the connecting section a. This is externally preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not necessarily provided and the air brush may be used without the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Also, if the sizes of the threadedly engaging portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the abutting portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are adjusted for a conventional air brush, the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be mounted on an air brush which a user has already owned, and the same adjusting function as the above embodiment of the present invention has can be provided to the conventional air brush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, while the embodiment is constructed such that the threaded portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (external thread) of the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is threadedly mounted in the threaded opening <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (internal thread) of the air brush body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the threadedly mounting relationship between the external thread and the internal thread may be reversed, that is, the air brush body has the external thread and the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the internal thread (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Also, the shape of the abutting portion provided in the cap member <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may not be limited to any form, insofar as it can be integrated with the cap member, abutted against the end of the adjusting screw <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> retreating and can stop the retreating of the adjusting screw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Since the air brush of the present invention is constructed as described, by the rotating of the cap member threadedly connected to the rear portion of the air brush body and the adjusting of the axial core directional movement of the abutting portion provided in the interior of the cap member, together with the movement of the cap member, a position at which the chuck adjusting screw is abutted against the abutting portion, that is, an ultimately retreating position of the needle, can be arbitrarily set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Therefore, like the conventional air brush provided the adjusting knob (adjusting mechanism), the air brush of the present invention can be used so as to spray the coating material while keeping the discharge of the coating material from the nozzle constant when the operating lever is pulled to the ultimate retreating position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Also, in situation where the operating lever is operated to the ultimate retreating position by rotating the cap member to cause the cap member to be moved in the axial direction within the range of the threaded engagement of the connecting section, the discharge of the coating material from the nozzle can be adjustably increased and reduced and it is possible to perform the spraying of the predetermined thick lines of the coating material, spot-blowing of the coating material and the spraying of the camouflage lines of the coating material while keeping the spraying in a best condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the air brush of the present invention can be provided with the adjusting mechanism only by the provision of the abutting portion in the interior of the cap member as the adjusting mechanism for receiving and stopping the operating lever at the ultimate retreating position, so that the air brush can be provided with the mechanism for adjusting the ultimate retreating position of the operating lever, namely, the adjusting mechanism for keeping the discharge of the coating material constant, while keeping the same manufacturing cost as that of the conventional air brush without the adjusting mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The air brush according to second aspect of the present invention is constructed, in the above air brush, such that the ring having a predetermined width is removably and threadedly mounted on the threadedly connecting section between the air brush body and the cap member and is interposed between the air brush body and the cap member. Therefore, in the event that the adjusting mechanism of the air brush is not used, by threadedly mounting the ring on the threadedly connecting section, the margin space corresponding to the width of the ring is produced between the end of the chuck adjusting screw and the abutting portion within the cap member to render the adjusting mechanism unavailable, whereby the air brush can be used perfectly like the conventional air brush. Also, in a used-condition, the threadedly connecting section between the air brush body and the cap member has no margin space for adjusting the movement of the cap member, so that this is externally preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Having described specific preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications can be effected therein by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
