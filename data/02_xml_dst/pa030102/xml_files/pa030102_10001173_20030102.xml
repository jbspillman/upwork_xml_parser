<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A phase detector circuit for a phase control loop includes two EXOR circuits and an integrating loop filter which are connected to form one circuit. The two EXOR circuits have common load resistors or current sources. The output signals from the EXOR circuits are integrated through the use of two integrators, which are respectively connected in parallel with the common load resistors or current sources. The voltage across the two integrators provides the output voltage of the loop filter. This eliminates the need for an additional differential amplifier and integrator. The phase detector has a low current consumption and can be produced with a simplified circuit technique. </paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Field of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a phase detector circuit for a phase control loop and in particular to a phase detector circuit for a phase locked loop (PLL) circuit or a delay locked loop (DLL) circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Phase control loops are used for data regeneration in integrated circuits. The aim of data regeneration is to align a reference clock signal with respect to the data of a data signal and to use this reference clock signal to produce a regenerated data signal in which all the data bits have the same pulse width and the same amplitude and in which any jitter is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is common practice to realize phase control loops using phase locked loop (PLL) circuits. A PLL circuit has a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) which provides a desired reference clock signal on the basis of a filtered signal from a phase comparator. A PLL phase locked loop is described by Charles R. Hogge, Jr. in the article with the title &ldquo;A Self Correcting Clock Recovery Circuit,&rdquo; Journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol. LT-3, No. 6, December 1985, pages 1312 ff. and also in U.S. Pat. No. 4,535,459. A PLL phase control loop of this type is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The phase control loop shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> has two D-type flip-flop circuits <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, two EXOR components <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an input filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an integrating loop filter (or phase comparator) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a voltage controlled oscillator VCO <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The input D of the first flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives data signals Din from a digital data signal, which is also applied to one input of the first EXOR component <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A second input C of the first flip-flop <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives a reference clock signal produced by the oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A non-inverted output Q of the first flip-flop <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to one input of the first EXOR component <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, to one input of the second EXOR component <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and to a data input D of the second flip-flop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second input C of the second flip-flop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in turn has the clock signal from the oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> applied to it. An non-inverted output Q of the second flip-flop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is coupled to the other input of the second EXOR component <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and, also, is the data output D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the phase control loop, at which output the regenerated data signal D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The logic signals E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> produced at the outputs of the EXOR components <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are subjected, after initial filtering in the input filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, to difference formation and subsequent integration in the integrating loop filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this context, the integrating loop filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is frequently realized by using a charge pump and a downstream-connected low pass filter. The charge pump essentially integrates the output signal from the EXOR components <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The output value from the loop filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is a DC value L, is then supplied to the oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which adjusts the phase of the reference clock signal it produces on the basis of the DC value applied. The output of the oscillator <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is supplied to the inputs C of the flip-flops <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For the precise configuration and the precise manner of operation of the circuit, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,535,459. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Examples of known embodiments of an EXOR circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. A phase detector circuit and EXOR circuits according to the prior art are explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this case, A, An and B, Bn denote the differential inputs of the EXOR circuit. In accordance with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an EXOR circuit has transistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and also two resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, from which an output voltage is tapped at the reference points Q, Qn. The transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> used as current source sets the current in the circuit, and this current determines the output level on the resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The configuration of the transistors provides an EXOR (exclusive OR) function. The circuit is based on the customary CML (Collector Mode Logic) technique. The reference voltages are indicated as Vdd and Vss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, unlike in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, no current source determining the output level on the resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided. The resulting current is determined through the use of the resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the respective residual resistances of the transistors T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the known EXOR circuits in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference>, it is necessary to control the differential inputs A, An, B, Bn using appropriate voltages in order to obtain the desired currents in R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thus, at high frequencies, there is no longer any firm or fixed impression of currents. The circuits shown normally have a voltage output and need to have an accordingly low impedance at the reference points Q, Qn, i.e. the current needs to be at a correspondingly high level. This is problematic for high data rates, at which the current consumption should be reduced as far as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A drawback of the known circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is that fast EXOR components and also subsequent filters, differential amplifiers and integrators are required. Particularly the EXOR components require considerable power losses at high data rates for these reasons. In general, radio-frequency circuits using CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) or bipolar technology, which are operated at the upper frequency limit, have a considerable current consumption. The circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> therefore needs to be simplified and needs to have a reduced current requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to phase control loops using a PLL circuit, phase control loops using a delay locked loop (DLL) circuit are also known. A delay locked loop (DLL) circuit requires no voltage controlled oscillator and produces an output signal which has a predetermined delay with respect to an input reference signal. However, the problems mentioned with respect to PLL circuits arise in this case, too, because phase comparators and integrating loop filters are likewise used. A DLL circuit is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,855, for example. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a phase detector circuit for a phase control loop which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known circuits of this general type and which has a low current consumption and can be produced using a simplified circuit technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a phase detector circuit for a phase control loop, including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> an input connection for receiving input data; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> a data regeneration circuit operatively connected to the input connection, the data regeneration circuit regenerating the input data in dependence of a clock signal; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> two EXOR circuits connected to the data regeneration circuit, the EXOR circuits operating as phase comparators; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> an integrating loop filter connected to the two EXOR circuits such that the two EXOR circuits and the integrating loop filter are connected to form one circuit, the integrating loop filter integrating a difference between signals provided by the two EXOR circuits and the integrating loop filter providing an output signal controlling a generation of the clock signal fed back to the data regeneration circuit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> the two EXOR circuits having common circuit elements which are load resistors or current sources; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> two integrators respectively connected in parallel to the common circuit elements, the two integrators integrating output signals provided by the two EXOR circuits; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> the integrating loop filter providing, as the output signal, a voltage resulting at the two integrators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In other words, according to the invention, the EXOR circuits and the integrating loop filter of a phase detector circuit are connected to form one circuit. This is done such that, firstly, the two EXOR circuits have common load resistors or current sources, and, secondly, the output signals from the EXOR circuits are integrated using two integrators which are respectively connected in parallel with the common load resistors or current sources. In this case, the voltage across the two integrators is the output voltage of the loop filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The basic principle of the circuit according to the invention is that it is not the voltages, which are evaluated on the load resistors or current sources. This is because, for this case, it would be necessary for the load resistors or current sources to be a low-impedance configuration, and a considerable current consumption would therefore be necessary, which is exactly what needs to be prevented. Instead, according to the invention, the currents from the transistors in the EXOR circuits are evaluated, which means that the circuit can be given a much higher impedance. Accordingly, the load resistors or current sources are preferably a high-impedance configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The fact that the two EXOR circuits have common load resistors or current sources means that a difference is automatically formed between the signals of the two EXOR circuits. A separate differential amplifier is thus obviated. In addition, the configuration of the integrators in accordance with the invention, which are directly linked to the EXOR circuits, makes it possible to eliminate the use of a separate integrator or of a separate charge pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to another feature of the invention, the common circuit elements are high-impedance elements such that the common circuit elements, in conjunction with the integrators, provide an integrating action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to yet another feature of the invention, the integrators each include a series circuit and a capacitance provided in parallel to the series circuit, the series circuit includes a resistor and a further capacitance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the two EXOR circuits have common current sources, and the current flowing through the current sources is set by a mirror circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, the two EXOR circuits have common load resistors, the current flowing through the load resistors being set by a current source transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A data regeneration circuit preferably includes two D-type flip-flop circuits which each have a data input and a clock input and are coupled to the EXOR circuits. In this case, the regenerated data are produced at the uninverted output of the second D-type flip-flop circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred feature of the invention, the phase detector is used for a phase locked loop circuit or a delay locked loop circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a phase detector circuit for a phase control loop, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawings in detail and first, particularly, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a circuit according to the invention whose functionality corresponds to the functionality of block <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Accordingly, two EXOR circuits whose configuration corresponds to the circuits in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and which include transistors T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, . . . , T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; are connected together such that a respective common load resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the top outputs of the transistors T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;, T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this case, the transistors T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, . . . , T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; have the signals Din, Dinn, D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Din, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>n according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> applied to them, as is shown. In this case, the index &ldquo;n&rdquo; (n&equals;negated) represents the respectively inverted signals. In this regard, it should be pointed out that the figures show only one signal (cf. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). In actual fact, differential signals are preferably involved in each case. This has the advantage of a lower signal-to-noise ratio and is customary for fast circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Provided in parallel with the load resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a respective integrator X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which, in the exemplary embodiment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, includes a resistor R and a capacitance C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected in series and a capacitance C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provided in parallel with the series circuit, but which may also be of different configuration. The output voltage L, Ln of the circuit is tapped at the common reference points of resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and integrator X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and, respectively, resistor R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and integrator X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and is supplied to a VCO or to a phase shifter which aligns a clock signal to the data signal under consideration in a manner which is known per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The use of a common resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> automatically forms a difference between the two EXOR circuits upon integration, since the respective output signals are superimposed at the resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in each case. This allows to dispense with a separate differential amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the currents from the transistors T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and, respectively, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are evaluated, which means that the circuit can be operated at very high impedances. This lowers the current consumption of the circuit considerably. For operating the circuit at high impedance, the resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are of configured as high-impedance resistors and small currents are provided in T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and, respectively, T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; to T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime;. In this context, parasitic capacitances play no part on account of the integration carried out at the same time at the nodes L, Ln. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The load resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which are configured as high-impedance resistors, have an integrating action in conjunction with the filter C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, R or integrator X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> it is also possible to use EXOR circuits according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> with an additional current source transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The configuration is otherwise identical, wherein in this embodiment the current can easily be set using the current source transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out that the transistors T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . , T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&prime;, . . . , T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&prime; may be field effect transistors, in particular transistors of the CMOS type, or may be bipolar transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> differs from the exemplary embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> to the extent that, instead of the resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, current sources T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> act as the load, the current sources being controlled by the signal Icontr. The current sources T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are transistors in current source mode, i.e. they are configured as high-impedance elements. The use of current sources T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> as the load makes it possible to increase the gain of the stage as compared with simple resistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an alternative embodiment in which transistors T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> represent a current mirror for the current sources T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the current mirror is used to set the current. In this case, the current in T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is equal to half the value of the current in T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
