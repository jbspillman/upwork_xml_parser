<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to chip antennas used in mobile communication terminals and Local Area Networks (LANs), and more particularly to a chip antenna in which a conductor pattern comprised of primary and secondary conductor lines formed independently is formed on a rectangular solid-shaped base block made of a dielectric or magnetic substance, thus miniaturizing the chip antenna and improving the bandwidth of a single frequency of the chip antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As well known to those skilled in the art, conventional mobile communication devices are each composed of a device body, and a bar antenna installed to be protruded from the upper portion of the device body and used for transmitting and receiving electric waves signals. Here, the resonance frequency of the antenna is determined by the entire length of a conductor composing the antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional antenna for mobile communication devices is problematic in that it fails to support the trend towards the miniaturization of mobile communication terminals due to its outward protrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the construction of a chip antenna for solving this problem is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the chip antenna comprises a body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> made of a dielectric material, a conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> helically formed in and on the surface of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and comprised of dual conductor lines arranged in parallel with each other, and a feeding terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> arranged on the surface of the body <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to apply a voltage to the conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is constructed such that one conductor line is connected to the other conductor line through a reversing unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the frequency bandwidth of the chip antenna is widened by increasing areas of opposite conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the ground so as to increase capacitance, while not increasing the entire length of the conductor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the conventional chip antenna is disadvantageous in that the frequency bandwidth capable of being widened is restricted, and the antenna characteristics are greatly varied according to a distance between the parallel conductor lines, thus decreasing the reliability of the chip antenna. </paragraph>
</section>
