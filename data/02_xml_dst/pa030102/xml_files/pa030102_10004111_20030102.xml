<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The thickening of dental plaque from bacteria is primarily due to the nutritive supply of sucrose, because bacteria all have enzymes for glycolysis. In this manner, the analysis of dental plaque shows proteins that have an adhesive characteristic, as well as polysaccharides, produced by the bacterial metabolism of sucrose, and which form the base material of the plaque matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is a difference, however, between extra-cellular polysaccharides: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> a) soluble </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> dextrans: glucose polymers that form linear chains &agr;-1.6 and multiple branches &agr;-1.3, and sometimes &agr;-2.1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> leavens: polymers that are linear and sometimes branched by fructose. The osidic link is type &bgr;-2.6 and &bgr;-2. 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> glucans: glucose homopolymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> b) insoluble </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> mutanes: glucose polymers &agr;-1.3 and sometimes &agr;-1.6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> And intrabacterial polysaccharides: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> amylopectin: linear polymers of glucose that form chains &agr;-1.4 and branches in &agr;-0.6 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition, we also know that the compounds used for toothpaste are currently most often presented in the form of a paste, a solution or a powder. To use them, it is necessary to measure a specific quantity and apply it to the teeth using a toothbrush. Use of this type of brush is a constraint for multiple reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Among other reasons, the need to use a toothbrush is a reason why it is difficult to get children to brush their teeth regularly. Likewise, when one is out of the house, it is impossible to clean one&apos;s teeth after a meal or before an exam. It is also very difficult to clean the teeth of animals, especially dogs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For a long time prior to the present invention, the process of adding substances to dental care compositions such as toothpaste, mouthwash, dental floss, sprays, chewing gums and tablets, which are designed as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for the treatment of teeth, gums or saliva has been common practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> There exists in the art dental products which contain various fluorides as active substances for the prevention of dental caries and cavities, and active organic and biochemical substances which prevent or reduce the formation of dental plaque and/or tartar. The primary drawback of each of these substances, and the dental products in the prior art, is that the active substances do not have enough time to remain in contact with the teeth, gums and saliva to become fully activated, especially due to the relatively short time period a composition may be exposed to the teeth during brushing or using an oral rinse, mouthwash or other dental product of the art. In such products, a significant portion of the potential effectiveness of the products is lost. This is especially true for children where compliance using traditional products is marginal at best. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Also, there exists a long-felt need for enhanced dental hygiene in dogs, cats and other domestic animals, which presently is non-existent, due to the impossibility of effectively brushing the teeth of domestic animals and the short application time of ancillary dental products such as sprays, pastes, chewable products and tablets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Dental caries is an infectious disease which is ubiquitous in humans. Dental caries is caused by colonies of bacterial microorganisms and in particular Actinomyces sp. and <highlight><italic>Streptococcus mucans</italic></highlight>, which form on the surfaces of the teeth to form a very adhesive dental plaque. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide dental compositions which may be used to deliver active agents to the surface of the teeth of mammals, especially domestic animals such as dogs and cats and humans, particularly human children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide compositions which contain ingredients which maximize the surface and duration of coverage of the compositions on the teeth of the subjects in order to enhance delivery of active agents for preventing and/or treating dental diseases and/or conditions and reducing microbial flora, tartar, plaque and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide additives which may be included in dental care composition to enhance the anti-caries, anti-plaque and anti-microbial activity of the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide methods for treating and/or preventing dental conditions and/or disease states including dental caries, tartar, plaque and the like or for reducing microbial flora which may be responsible for dental caries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Any one or more of these and/or other objects of the present invention may be readily gleaned from a review of the description of the invention which follows. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides a new dental or oral care composition which is gelled or may form a gelled matrix after hydration with an aqueous solution such as saliva and finds particular use in oral hygiene, for the treatment of teeth and gums. The oral care compositions according to the present invention include an effective amount of a gelling agent comprising about 0.05% to about 25% by weight of said oral care composition, preferably about 0.1% to about 20% by weight and more preferably about 0.5% to about 15% by weight of said composition, said gelling agent comprising silica (micronized, hydrated or aerosol) as a lipophilic gelling agent, alone or in combination with at least one other orally compatible lipophilic gelling agent or preferably, a hydrophilic gelling agent. In preferred embodiments according to the present invention, the gelling agent according to the present invention comprises a mixture of micronized, hydrated or aerosol silica and a hydrophilic gelling agent, with the weight ratio of silica to hydrophilic gelling agent in the final dental care composition falling within the range of about 1:1 to about 1:6, more preferably about 1:1 to about 1:3, such composition being specifically adapted to adhere to teeth and provide a sustained or prolonged release action by the ability of the composition to adhere to teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the present invention, dental care compositions according to the present invention comprise colostrum and optionally, at least one additional antimicrobial enzyme, preferably at least one enzyme selected from the group consisting of lactoperoxidase and lysozyme, in addition to other optional agents for delivery to the teeth and oral cavity are also contemplated. Dental care compositions according to this aspect of the present invention may be used alone, or optionally, in combination with the first aspect of the invention, which relates to the inclusion of a gelling agent to produce a gelled matrix. Compositions according to this aspect of the present invention are particularly useful for the prevention, reduction or elimination of dental caries, cavities, plaque, microbial growth and gum diseases, including periodontal disease because of the unexpected and exceptional antimicrobial activity that such compositions display. In alternative embodiments of this aspect of the present invention, optional proteins selected from the group consisting of lactoferrin, dextranase, mutanase, cellulase, amylo-glucosidase, papain, bromelin and mixtures thereof, all included in effective amounts may be added to the dental care compositions according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be used in oral care products in mammals, especially humans, including children and domestic animals by providing controlled doses (in certain cases, controlled or sustained release doses) of elements which have a specific activity as well as extended action of those elements. The present compositions may be used effectively in the fight against dental cavities, against microbial flora and to combat hard or dental plaque by coating the anterior and posterior sides of the teeth and by fighting and/or removing tartar and/or calcium deposits encrusted between the teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In this aspect of the present invention, the present compositions permit active substances such as fluorides, chemical, biochemical or biological antimicrobial agents, filmogen agents, anti-tartar agents, vitamins, minerals, micronutrients and other nutrients for the teeth, such as calcium, for example, to be applied to the surface of the teeth and to keep them there for an extended period of time so that their properties may be activated and exhibit maximum effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As a result of the adhesive characteristics of dental plaque, its mode or type of composition and the hygienic products that are too rapidly put into contact with the teeth or gums, and in addition, that are not available in an individual format, it has been discovered that a remedy for these inconveniences is a dental care product according to the present invention that is available in tablet form and gels when it comes into contact with water or other aqueous solution, notably saliva, or a semi-solid gel that has been partially or fully pre-gelled into a single dose to be applied directly onto the teeth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This tablet or semi-solid gel contains in its gelling matrix active substances, which may be hydrophilic or lipophilic, preferably agents which are hydrophilic and agents which are lipophilic which would act directly on dental plaque and bacteria to remove, eliminate, reduce and/or inhibit the growth of bacteria or strengthen teeth and provide dental care. The present compositions are designed to be applied directly onto the teeth and gums, and to remain in contact with the teeth for a period of time sufficient to release the active elements onto the teeth, gum tissue and where applicable, into the saliva. The release of active from the matrix according to the present invention onto the teeth is therefore gradual and sustained by the flow of saliva; that is to say, the active hydrophilic and lipophilic substances are &ldquo;kept by retaining them in a reservoir.&rdquo; In this manner, one can achieve optimal use of the full action of the active materials in order to offer a significant contribution to the healthy maintenance of teeth and gums anywhere and at any time, without brushing or rinsing, in a single dose format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Without being limited by way of theory, it is believed that the mechanism of activating the product of this invention comprises placing the dry or partially hydrated dental composition into the mouth, allowing the composition, where applicable, to hydrate to produce a gel material (in other embodiments, the material will be at least partially pre-gelled and can be applied directly to the teeth without a first hydration step), at least partially spreading the gel matrix onto or over the teeth, and then allowing active substances within the gelled matrix to be gradually released from the matrix so that the actives will exhibit maximum effect on the teeth or gum tissue. After the matrix of the product of the invention gels, generally after contact with saliva during the chewing process, the active substances that are trapped in this matrix are then gradually released by saliva and chewing, by the mechanical effect of repeated friction from the silica or any abrasive material, as well as by the passage of the tongue over the teeth as a brush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Compositions according to the present invention in any aspect or embodiment may be formulated for oral delivery advantageously in the form of a toothpaste, gel, paste, pill, tablet, especially including a chewable tablet, dry tablet, buccal tablet, spray, solution, lozenge, soaked napkin, dental floss or any other prepared form applicable to ingestible dental hygiene products in a single-dose form </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The following terms shall be used throughout the present specification to describe the invention. It is noted here that where a term has not been given a specific definition in the specification, the term will have that meaning which is understood by those of skill within the applicable art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;patient&rdquo; or &ldquo;subject&rdquo; shall mean a mammal, preferably a domesticated mammal or human, preferably including a human child having a need for dental care because that animal has dental plaque, tartar, microbial flora, dental caries or cavities, halitosis, gum disease or other dental disease or condition or otherwise wishes to make the teeth less sensitive, cosmetically treat the teeth in order to whiten the teeth or to prevent or slow the aging process on dental tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; is used throughout the specification to describe the period that a gel or film will remain in contact with the teeth or gums of the subject or patient after initial contact. In the present invention, the gel and/or the film formed from the gel will remain on the teeth for a period of at least about 5 minutes, preferably at least about 30 minutes and more preferably at least about 1 hour or longer. In certain aspects of the present invention, the film produced by delivery to the teeth of a subject or patient will remain on the teeth until such time as the teeth are brushed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;gelled&rdquo; or &ldquo;gel&rdquo; is used throughout the specification to describe the condition of certain preferred embodiments of the dental care compositions according to the present invention. A gelled composition according to the present invention is a product in a gel-like state having a viscosity ranging from about 250 cps to about 10,000 cps, preferably about 500 cps to about 3,500 cps, even more preferably about 750 cps to about 1,500 cps. The gelled feature of certain embodiments of the present invention is an important feature inasmuch as it is the gelled composition which has a viscosity high enough to allow the formulation to adhere to or coat the teeth and/or gums of the subject or patient using the composition. From the adhered or coated composition, the active agents within the present compositions may be delivered to the teeth or gums of the subject in a manner consistent with sustained or maximum delivery of actives to the sites of activity on the teeth or gums. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;viscosity&rdquo; is used to describe an important feature of certain embodiments according to the present invention. Viscosity is a property or quality of compositions according to the present invention which relates to the resistance of the composition to flow. For purposes of the present invention, viscosity is measured in centipoise units as determined by a Brookfield Programmable Viscometer using the required DV-II&plus;spindle at 0.5 rpm. Compositions according to the present invention which have lower viscosities, i.e., viscosities which are less than about 1,000-1,500 centipoise (cps) units tend to be flowable. As the viscosity of the compositions decreases, the flowability of the composition increases. Compositions which have viscosities which are less than about 1,000-1,500 cps are readily flowable and deliverable to sites on the teeth and gums, whereas those compositions which have viscosities which are greater than about 1,500 cps tend to be less flowable, but still deliverable within the context of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;effective&rdquo; is used throughout the specification to describe amounts of specific chemicals or components which are included in dental care compositions according to the present invention. An effective amount of a specific chemical or component is that amount which is included to produce its intended effect in the final composition. For example, an effective amount of a gelling agent, is that amount of such an agent which will gel the final composition upon exposure to saliva or other aqueous solution, including water. In the case of an anti-tartar compound, the amount of such a compound will be that amount which instills anti-tartar characteristics to the final composition used in the mouth of the subject of patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;silica&rdquo;, &ldquo;hydrated silica&rdquo;, &ldquo;micronized silica&rdquo;, &ldquo;aerosol silica&rdquo; is used throughout the specification to describe an additive used in the present invention which is derived from silicon dioxide and is added for the benefits it provides as a base material to provide a gel-like consistency to the dental care compositions as well as aiding in the continued release of actives from film which is in contact with the teeth and/or gums of the subject/patient after delivery of the composition to the teeth and/or gums. The silica used in the present invention is hydrophobic (lipophilic) in nature, is naturally occurring and is processed from a naturally occurring mineral (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) into granular or beaded form. It has the ability of absorbing lipophilic active agents, such as oils, lipophilic vitamins and other active agents. Preferred forms of silica for use in the present invention include micronized silica, aerosol type silica, amorpohous silica and hydrated silica, all of which forms of silica are well known in the art. In certain compositions the silica is most preferably both micronized and hydrated. These materials are included in compositions according to the present invention in amounts effective to facilitate gelling and/or the release of actives from the gel matrix which forms in contact with the teeth/gums of the subject or patient after administration of the present dental care compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;lipophilic gelling agent&rdquo; is used throughout the specification to describe certain gelling agents which may be used in the present invention and are lipophilic in character. These gelling agents include silica (also known as silica gel, as otherwise described above), as well as other pharmaceutically acceptable lipophilic gelling agents such as acrylic gelling agents, which are copolymers of (meth)acrylate monomers and other monomers such as (meth)acrylic acid and poly(meth)acrylate polymeric gelling agents such as those based on (meth)acrylic acid, methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, n-propyl (meth)acrylate, isopropyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate, t-butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, isobomyl (meth)acrylate, cetyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, stearyl (meth)acrylate, dodecyl (meth)acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylic diethylene glycol ethoxylate, 2-methoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 3-methoxybutyl (meth)acrylate, phenoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl (meth)acrylate and cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate and polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers (PVP), among numerous others. Lipophilic gelling agents are useful for accommodating (solubilizing, emulsifying) lipophilic actives which are desirably added to compositions according to the present invention and to modify or alter the kinetics of release of hydrophilic compounds from the dental compositions. In certain aspects of the present invention any one or more of these lipophilic gelling agents may be substituted for the silica gelling agent in compositions according to the present invention. When used, these agents comprise about 0.05% to about 15% by weight of the final composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;hydrophilic gelling agent&rdquo; is used to describe certain gelling agents which are advantageously added to silica or other lipophilic gelling agents in certain preferred embodiments according to the present invention to produce compositions which exhibit both a lipophilic character from the silica or other lipophilic gelling agent and a hydrophilic character from the hydrophilic gelling agent. Preferred hydrophilic gelling agents for use in the present invention include gelling agents which are orally compatible and ingestible and include for example, carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, methylethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, guar gum (including the hydroxy guar derivative), carob gum, karaya gum, algin, carageenan, and mixtures thereof. In general, these hydrophilic gelling agents are included in final dental care compositions according to the present invention in amounts ranging from about 0.05% to about 25% by weight, more preferably about 0.1% to about 15% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Preferred hydrophilic gelling agents for use in the present invention are selected from the hydrophilic cellulose gelling agents, most preferably, carboxymethyl cellulose or carageenan or a mixture of a lactomannan (e.g., guar gum or carob gum), algin and carageenan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In certain aspects of the present invention, compositions comprise a mixture of silica and at least one hydrophilic gelling agent in a weight ratio of silica to hydrophilic gelling agent of about 1:1 to about 1:6, with a preferred weight ratio being about 1:1 to about 1:3. Other lipophilic gelling agents may also be added to the present compositions, in amounts generally ranging from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight, more preferably about 0.2% to about 5% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Compositions according to the present invention are characterized in that they comprise a base material in powder form that has already absorbed various active hydrosoluble or lipophilic elements or materials; this base material constitutes the future matrix, as it is made up of organic and/or mineral matter that gels rapidly upon contact with water and is easily digestible, as it may be bitten, chewed, licked or directly applied, for human or animal applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Compositions according to the present invention comprise an effective amount of silica in an amount ranging from about 0.05% to about 25% by weight, preferably about 0.1% to about 15% by weight, optionally, in combination with at least one digestible hydrophilic gelling agent selected from the group consisting of a hydrophilic cellulose gelling agent, guar gum, carob gum, karaya gum, algin, carageenan and mixture thereof, said silica and said hydrophilic gelling agent being included in said dental care composition in preferred weight ratios of silica to hydrophilic gelling agent within the range of about 1:1 to about 1:6. Optionally, additional lipophilic gelling agents may be added to the silica alone or in combination with the hydrophilic gelling agents in amounts ranging from about 0.05% to about 15% by weight of the final compositions, more preferably about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. When combinations of gelling agents (which gelling agents include silica, hydrophilic gelling agents and optionally, other lipophilic gelling agents) are used in the present invention, the amount of silica which is included in the mixture of gelling agents ranges from about 15% to about 45% by weight of the gelling agent mixture and the hydrophilic gelling agent ranges from about 40% to about 85% by weight of the gelling agent mixture, the remainder of the gelling agent comprising a lipophilic gelling agent as otherwise described herein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> For example, in the case of anti-plaque or anti-microbial formulations, the inclusion of colostrum protein as an effective agent is important. Colostrum may be included with one or more proteins selected from the group consisting of lysozyme and lactoperoxidase, preferably in combination with both lysozyme and lactoperoxidase, optionally, in the presence of lactoferrine. Other optional proteins which may be included in this aspect of the present invention are selected from the group consisting of vegetable peroxidase, dextranase, mutanase, cellulase, papain and bromelin. In this aspect of the present invention, dental care compositions comprising an effective amount of colostrum in combination with other additives typically used to provide dental care compositions as toothpaste, gel, paste, pill, tablet, dry tablet, spray, solution or lozenge, soaked napkin or dental floss, among others, are contemplated by this aspect of the invention. Thus, an effective amount of colostrum and optionally, one or more protein as otherwise described above, may be formulated with at least one other additive typically used to produce dental care compositions selected from the group consisting of solvents, diluents, thickeners, gelling agents, abrasives, flavoring agents, coloring agents, anti-cavity agents, anti-microbial agents, anti-tartar agents, film-forming agents, dental enamel mineralizers, dental enamel protectors and whiteners, sweeteners, agents to improve appearance, anti-halitosis agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-sensitivity agents, coloring agents, sweeteners, especially non-nutritive sweeteners, nutritive cleaners and surfactants, anti-aging compositions and mixtures thereof . In dental care compositions according to the present invention, the amount of colostrum included is an effective amount, which generally includes an amount ranging from about 0.5% to about 7.5% by weight, more preferably about 1% to about 5% by weight. Preferred compositions comprise a combination of an effective amount of colostrum in combination with an effective amount of lactoperoxidase and/or lysozyme. In such compositions, lactoperoxidase comprises about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of the final composition and lysozyme comprises about 0.05% to about 3% by weight. In this aspect of the present invention, the weight of colostrum to either lactoperoxidase or lysozyme preferably falls within the range of about 1:3 to about 100:1, more preferably about 1:1 to about 10:1, with a most preferred range of about 1:1 to about 3:1.

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Of course, the present invention is not limited to the specially considered examples shown above; on the contrary, it encompasses all kinds of variations, particularly with respect to the nature of the active elements incorporated into the base material, as well as to their proportions relative to these elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In particular, in accordance with this invention, tablets or single doses of concentrated partially hydrated gel may be prepared, using a weight adapted to the size of the human being or the animal for which they are destined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> With respect to another characteristic of the product of the invention, the base material is made up of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As base material or lipophilic matrix, having the property of absorbing liquid lipophilic substances, it gels in contact with water and forms a biofixating network, among these substances there are acrylic or polyacrylate derivatives, micronized silica, aerosyl type, or Polyvinyl pyrolidone (PVP), with a proportion of between about 0.05 and 15% by weight of the composition according to the present invention; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As base material or hydrophilic matrix, a water soluble cellulose polymer, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, or simply CMC, is a derivative of cellulose; it is a vegetable polymer and is therefore commonly found in nature. It is, notably, the main component element in wood, cotton, straw, sugarcane and grasses. Cellulose is a polysaccharide made up of groups of glucose, and the formula may be written as follows: natural cellulose has a molecular weight of between 500,000 and 1,500,000. The chemical reactions that provide CMC are sometimes accompanied by significant deterioration, which decreases the molecular weight back to lower values of between 80,000 and 800,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Cellulose is not water-soluble by nature. It is only endowed with this property following chemical reactions that provide CMC, on the one hand, and on the other, salts, as by-products. Raw CMC loses its salts when it is washed in water and alcohol, after which it provides a particularly pure product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> CMC dissolves in either hot or cold water. Given its affinity for water, it must only be added slowly and with constant mixing in order to avoid the formation of lumps. It is generally mixed with other pulverulent products to facilitate its dissolution. Derivatives such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose are also used in this invention for their water-soluble properties, and also to achieve a viscous gel very rapidly; the proportion can be between about 0.1 and 25%, more preferably about 1% to about 15% by weight by weight of the final composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Beta cyclodextrine can also be incorporated as an optional gelling agent in combination with the water soluble cellulose derivative, preferably CMC, with a proportion of between about I and 10% by weight of the final composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Carob gum is extracted from the endosperm of the grain of the carob tree. It is easily soluble in hot water and must be heated to achieve its optimum viscosity. At a concentration of 1% in water, the carob gum shows a viscosity of between about 1,500 to 3,500 cps. It shows significant synergies when combined with other hydrocolloids. The proportion can be between about 0.1 and 15% by weight of the final composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Guar gum, like carob gum, is a lactomannan. It hydrates very rapidly in saliva or cold water to form a high-viscosity gel. In an aqueous solution of 1%, the viscosity can vary from 2,500 to 8,000 cps, depending on the quality. Derivatives can also be used such as guar hydroxy; the proportion of the guar gum or related derivative can be between about 0.1 and 15% by weight of the final composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Karaya gum comes from the dried exudation of the &ldquo;Sterculia Urens&rdquo; tree, which is widespread in India. Karaya gum forms rapidly in viscous colloidal solutions, but does not dissolve easily in water. In a solution of 1%, the average viscosity is about 3,000 to 3,500 cps. Combined with other hydrocolloids, it shows a significant propensity for forming a gel as a linking and adhesive agent for the active ingredients by physical or electrostatic force; the proportion can be between about 0.1 and 10% by weight of the final composition, noting that the amount of karaya gum included in the final composition will depend upon the amount and type of the other gums, notably the water soluble gums used in the final product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The dry or partially-hydrated gelled concentrate form of this combination of hydrocolloid matrix permits an animal to chew or to lick as it pleases, by triggering the release of the active ingredients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The present compositions are prepared using standard formulary practice in the food, pharmaceutical and dental formulation arts. In general, compositions according to the present invention which are prepared as powders, tablets or the like and which gel after being exposed to an aqueous solution such as saliva, water or juice in the mouth of the patient or subject are prepared by homogenizing a mixture of components, in solid, liquid or gel form depending upon the final dosage form and then finalizing the dosage form using routine practices which are well known in the art to produce oral dosage forms such as toothpastes, gels, paste pills, sprays, solutions, lozenges, gums, soaked napkins, dental floss and any other form which may be administered orally. </paragraph>
