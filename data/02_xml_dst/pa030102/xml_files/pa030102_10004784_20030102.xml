<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates a method of manufacturing a flash memory device. In case of forming a dielectric film consisting of a lower oxide film, a nitride film and upper oxide film that is formed between a floating gate and a control gate, a nitrification process is performed after the lower oxide film is formed, thus forming a nitrogen layer below the lower oxide film. Then, an annealing process using an oxygen gas is performed to move the nitrogen layer onto the surface of the lower oxide film, thus forming a nitride film. Therefore, the present invention can reduce the effective thickness of the dielectric film. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to a method of manufacturing a flash memory device. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of manufacturing a flash memory device capable of reducing the effective thickness of a dielectric film, in a way that a lower oxide film is formed and the dielectric film consisting of the lower oxide film, a nitride film and a upper oxide film is then formed by implementing a nitrification process and oxygen annealing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Currently, an ONO film is usually used as a dielectric film of a high-integration flash memory device of over 0.18 &mgr;m, which consists of a lower oxide film(SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), a nitride film(Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) and a upper oxide film(SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The ONO film has the effective thickness of about 100 &angst;. In addition, if the thickness of the ONO film is reduced within the range in which the insulating breakage strength characteristic of a gate oxide film is not degraded, the ONO film can be used for a low voltage device. The gate of the flash memory cell can be effectively controlled by even low voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The ONO film serves as a barrier for preventing loss of electrons into a control ate in the floating gate. In order to perform this barrier, a thermal oxide film is most suitable. As the first polysilicon film used as the floating gate is crystallized and doped in-situ, however, the degree of oxidization in the grain and the grain boundary is different. As such, when the oxidization process is implemented, it is difficult to uniformly exactly control the thickness of a grown oxide film. Therefore, in a basic process today, a high temperature oxide film (HTO) deposited in thickness of about 40 &angst; by means of chemical vapor deposition(CVD) method using SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(DCS) gas, is used as the lower oxide film and the upper oxide film of the ONO film, respectively. A Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>film deposited in thickness of about 50&tilde;60 &angst; by means of LPCVD method is used as the nitride film. Further, in order to stabilize the interface characteristic and remove the trap charges, a steam annealing process of a wet oxidization process is implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As above, it is assumed that the entire thickness of the ONO film is important. As the design rule becomes small, there is a necessity to deposit the ONO film having a small effective rule. As the ONO film consists of three films, however, there is rarely reduction in the thickness and variations in the ratio. Thus, there is a limitation to reduce the thickness. Also, it is difficult to prohibit increase in the leakage current and decrease in the breakdown current. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a flash memory device capable of easily implementing a low voltage flash memory device by reducing the effective thickness of a dielectric film. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in detail by way of a preferred embodiment with reference to accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals are used to identify the same or similar parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1E</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views of a flash memory device, which are sequentially shown in order to explain a method of manufacturing the device according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> device isolation film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed at a given region of a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to define an active region and a device isolation region. An impurity ion implantation process is performed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the defined active region to form a well region (not shown). Then, a tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a first polysilicon film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are sequentially formed on the entire structure. The first polysilicon film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a given region of the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are etched by means of photolithography using the first mask and etching process. The semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is cleaned before the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed. At this time, a mixed solution of HF and SC-1 in the ratio of 50:1 may be used or a mixed solution of BOE and SC-1 in the ratio of 100:1&tilde;300:1 may be used. In addition, the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed by performing wet oxidization process at the temperature of 750&tilde;800&deg; C. and by performing annealing process at the temperature of 900&tilde;910&deg; C. under nitrogen (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) atmosphere of 5&tilde;10 l for 20-30 minutes. As above, the interface defect density with semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> can be minimized since the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed by wet oxidization process. Meanwhile, the first polysilicon film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed at the temperature of 550&tilde;620&deg; C. under the pressure of 0.1&tilde;1 Torr using SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas. At this time, with the phosphorous (P) concentration of the first polysilicon film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being a high concentration of 1.0E20&tilde;3.0E20 atoms/cc, sufficient dopants are supplied in order to give the conductivity through diffusion and activation of phosphorous by means of a subsequent annealing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2</cross-reference>, the wafer in which the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the first polysilicon film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are formed is loaded into a reaction furnace in which the temperature of 600&tilde;700&deg; C. and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere of 10&tilde;20 l are kept (<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). After the temperature of the furnace is raised at the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere of 5&tilde;10 l to 810&tilde;850&deg; C.(<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), a lower oxide film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is deposited by means of LPCVD method using DCS and N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O or NO gas (<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). At this time, the lower oxide film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is deposited in thickness of 35&tilde;100 &angst; at the deposition rate of 4&tilde;10 &angst;/min. Also, with the temperature of the furnace kept at 810&tilde;850&deg; C., introduction of DCS is stopped. Nitrification process by which N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O or NO gas of 1&tilde;20 l is introduced for 10&tilde;20 minutes is then implemented (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). At this time, the thickness of the increasing lower oxide film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is about 3&tilde;5 &angst;. The reason is that the nitrogen layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed below the lower oxide film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as the nitrogen concentration distribution shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. In other words, the nitrogen layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed in thickness of 3&tilde;5 &angst; below the lower oxide film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 2</cross-reference>, after the nitrification process, a nitrogen purge process is implemented to raise the temperature of the furnace to 850&tilde;950&deg; C. under the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere of 5&tilde;10 l (<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). After the temperature within the furnace is raised, an annealing process is implemented by introducing an oxygen gas of about 5&tilde;20 l for 5&tilde;20 minutes (<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Thus, the surface of the first polysilicon film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is oxidized and the nitrogen layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is therefore moved on a upper side of the lower oxide film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, thus forming a nitride film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> By reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 2</cross-reference>, after the temperature within the furnace is decreased to 810&tilde;850&deg; C. under the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere of 5&tilde;10 (<highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), a upper oxide film <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is formed in thickness of 35&tilde;100 &angst; by means of LPCVD method using DCS gas and N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O or NO gas (<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Then, after the temperature within the furnace is decreased to 600&tilde;700&deg; C. (<highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the wafer in which the ONO dielectric film is formed is unloaded from the furnace (<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E, a</cross-reference> second polysilicon film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and a tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are sequentially formed on the entire structure and an anti-reflection film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is then formed. At this time, the second polysilicon film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is formed by means of LPCVD method at the temperature of 530&tilde;550&deg; C. under the pressure of 0.1&tilde;1 Torr. Meanwhile, the second polysilicon film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> may be formed in a double structure of a doped polysilicon film and an undoped polysilicon film. At this time, it is recommended that the deposition ratio of the doped polysilicon film and the undoped polysilicon film is 4:1&tilde;7:1 and the entire thickness is 500&tilde;1000 &angst;. By doing this, when the tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is deposited, diffusion of fluorine (F) that is solidified/substituted into the dielectric film and that can increase the thickness of the dielectric film can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In case of forming the second polysilicon film in a double structure, the second polysilicon film is formed in-situ. The double structure can be formed as follows: the doped polysilicon film is first formed using SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas, and the undoped polysilicon film is then formed by introducing only SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gas with introduction of PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas being stopped. Also, the tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is formed enough to implement an adequate step coverage at the temperature of 300&tilde;500&deg; C. using the reaction of DCS and WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>that have a lower fluorine (F) content, a low post anneal stress and a good adhesive force, and to have the stoichiometric ratio of about 2.0&tilde;2.8 in order to minimize the sheet resistance. Also, the anti-reflection film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is formed of an oxidization nitride film or a nitride film. Thereafter, the anti-reflection film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the tungsten silicide film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the second polysilicon film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> are patterned by means of the photolithography process using the second mask to form a control gate. Then, the upper oxide film <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the nitride film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the lower oxide film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the first polysilicon film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are etched to form a floating gate. Thus, a stack gate in which the floating gate, the ONO dielectric film and the control gate are stacked is formed. Thereafter, an impurity ion implantation process is performed to form a source and a drain, thus completing a stack gate type flash memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from the above description with the present invention, as the thickness of the ONO film can be reduced, the gate can be effectively controlled and a low voltage flash memory device can be thus easily implemented. Also, it can be expected that the nitride film formed by oxygen annealing process has a low electron capture density compared to an existing ONO film formation process since the nitride film has a low nitrogen concentration file up within the lower oxide film. Due to this, the operating characteristic of the device can be improved. Further, as the dielectric film formation process and the steam anneal process are substituted with a single process, the cost is reduced and the productivity is also improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
