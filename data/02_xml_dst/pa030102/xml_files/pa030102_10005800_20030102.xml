<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The first delay means <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes the fourth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the fifth capacitor C<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which are connected between the first node Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the ground terminal Vss.

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The fifth inverting means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> includes a sixth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connected between the power supply terminal Vcc and the ground terminal Vss and driven depending on an output signal of the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; a seventh PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> driven by the potential of the first node Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, for inverting the potential of the first node Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; and a fourth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> driven depending on the output signals of the third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> includes an eighth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> connected between the power supply terminal Vcc and the ground terminal Vss and driven depending on an output signal of the second inverting means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; a ninth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> driven by the potential of the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for inverting the potential of the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; and a sixth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> driven by an output signal of the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The ATD circuit constructed as mentioned above detects that the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> transits the output signal AF of the address buffer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from LOW to HIGH, and the second pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> transits the output signal AF of the address buffer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> from HIGH to LOW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It will be explained in conjunction with the operational timing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The address signal ADD inputted to the address pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> pass through the address buffer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and then outputs the address buffer signal AF having the same phase to the address signal ADD inputted to the address pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to apply it to the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the second pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For example, if the address signal ADD inputted to the address pad <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is transited from a HIGH state to a LOW state during the period from &ldquo;T1&rdquo; time to &ldquo;T2&rdquo; time, the address transition detection signal ATDout the initial state of which is HIGH is transited to a LOW state and is then transited to a HIGH state during the period from &ldquo;T2&rdquo; time to &ldquo;T3&rdquo; time when the potential on the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is transited from a LOW state to a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the address buffer <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> outputs the address buffer signal AF having the same phase to the address pad signal APAD during the period from &ldquo;T1&rdquo; time to &ldquo;T2&rdquo; time. The address buffer signal AF is inverted by the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is then simultaneously inputted to the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the second pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> with a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The address buffer signal AF inverted to be a HIGH state is applied to the third inverting means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to turn on the first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the third inverting means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and at the time to turn off the second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an output signal of the third inverting means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is outputted with a LOW state since the potential on the first node Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is outputted to the ground terminal Vss via the first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A LOW state signal outputted on the first node Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stabilized by the first buffering means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> consisting of the first and second capacitors C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the sixth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the fifth inverting means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an input is turned off while the sixth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is turned on. Thereafter, the seventh PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the third inverting means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an input is turned on while the third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Also, the output signal of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an input is transited to a LOW state. The third PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the fourth inverting means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as an input is turned on while the second NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the power supply voltage of a HIGH state applied via the voltage fall unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the second resistor R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the power supply terminal Vcc is supplied to the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the third PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The potential of a HIGH state supplied to the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is stabilized by the second buffering means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is then applied to the ninth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is turned on by the potential of a HIGH state while the ninth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the fourth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the fifth inverting means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as an input is turned off while the eighth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> At this time, the potential on the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> starts to transit to a HIGH state from &ldquo;t1&rdquo; time when the potential on the first node Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is completely transited to a LOW state by the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. That is, at the moment when the potential on the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is completely transited to a LOW state and is then applied to the seventh PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the fifth inverting means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the potential on the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is maintained to be a LOW state and is then applied to the ninth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> At this time, the sixth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the fifth inverting means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is supplied with a HIGH state signal and is thus turned on, while the fourth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is supplied with a LOW state signal and is thus turned of. Also, the eighth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is supplied with a LOW state signal and is thus turned on, while the sixth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is supplied with a High state signal and is thus turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Due to this the fifth inverting means <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is maintained to be floated during the period from &ldquo;T2&rdquo; time to &ldquo;t1&rdquo; time while the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> outputs an output signal of a HIGH state to the seventh inverting means I<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the output unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The seventh inverting means I<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the output unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> inverts the output signal of a HIGH state to output the address transition detection signal ATDout of a LOW state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Then, if the potential on the second node Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is raised during the period from &ldquo;t1&rdquo; time to &ldquo;T3&rdquo; time and is thus transited to a HIGH state, during this time, the ninth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is turned off while the fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is turned on. Therefore, the output signals of the ninth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are transited to a LOW state. The output unit <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> inverts the potential of a LOW state again to output the address transition detection signal ATDout of a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> However, though the conventional ATD circuit as mentioned above must be driven only when an address is transited, the ATD circuit is driven at the value in which an unwanted noise or glitch such as &ldquo;A&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is included, that is, even at a HIGH state or a LOW state. Therefore, there is a problem that abnormal address transition detection signal ATDout is generated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The driving characteristic of the mentioned ATD will be now described in connection with the operational timing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. At this time, in case of an ideal address pad signal APAD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the driving characteristic of the ATD during the period from &ldquo;T11&rdquo; time to &ldquo;T12&rdquo; time will be omitted because it is same to the operational timing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The driving characteristic of the ATD only in the case that a glitch is generated in the address pad signal APAD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such as &ldquo;B&rdquo; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> given glitch outputted from the address pad <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> passes through the address buffer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> as shown in &ldquo;B&rdquo;. Then, address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is same in the phase to the glitch signal outputted from the address pad <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is outputted to the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the second pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For example, in case that a given glitch signal outputted from the address pad <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inputted to the address buffer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> from a LOW state to a HIGH state in a saw-toothed shape during the period form &ldquo;T13&rdquo; time to &ldquo;T14&rdquo;-time, the address buffer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> outputs an address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from a LOW state to a HIGH state having a rectangular wave at the time when the glitch signal reaches the highest point (&ldquo;T14&rdquo; time). Also, the address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inverted by the first inverting means Ill and is then simultaneously inputted to the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the second pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> with a LOW state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Explaining in more detail, at the &ldquo;T14&rdquo; time, the address buffer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> outputs the address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a rectangular wave having the same phase to the address pad signal APAD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inverted by the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is then simultaneously inputted to the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the second pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> with a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inverted into a LOW state is applied to the third inverting means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to turn on the second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the third inverting means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and to turn off the first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the power supply voltage is applied to the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> via the voltage fall unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, the second resistor R<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that the output of the third inverting means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is outputted with a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, at the &ldquo;T14&rdquo; time, the output signal of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as an input is transited into a HIGH state. The third PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the fourth inverting means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as an input is turned off while the third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Also, the fourth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the second control means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, that is transited to a LOW state, for receiving the first address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an input is turned off. Therefore, the second control means <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> is driven by a resistor device having a given resistance value by the fourth resistor R<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that the potential on the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is discharged into the ground terminal Vss via the fourth resistor R<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. That is, the potential charged with a HIGH state on the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is discharged into the ground terminal Vss via the first control means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is slowly transited with a LOW state by the second buffering means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the second delay means <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, at the &ldquo;T15&rdquo; time, if the address pad signal APAD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transited from a HIGH state to a LOW state, the address buffer <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> outputs the address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a rectangular wave, which has the same phase to the address pad signal APAD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inverted by the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and is then simultaneously inputted to the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the second pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> with a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Also, the second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the third inverting means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the first pulse detecting unit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> using the address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> inverted into a HIGH state as an input is turned off while the first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is turned on. Therefore, the potential on the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is discharged to the ground terminal Vss via the first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the third resistor R<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so that the output of the third inverting means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> starts to transit to a logic LOW state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Then, the potential on the first node Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stabilized by the first buffering means <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and is then applied to the third inverting means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also, the sixth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the fifth inverting means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is turned off by the output signal of the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while the sixth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is turned off by the output signal of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the third inverting means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is floated without regard to the potential on the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> inputted to the seventh PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the fifth inverting means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, at the &ldquo;T15&rdquo; time, the output signal of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as an input is transited to a LOW state. The third PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the fourth inverting means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as an input is turned on while the third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is turned off. Therefore, the power supply voltage Vcc is applied to the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the voltage fall unit <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, the second resistor R<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the third PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so that the output signal of the fourth inverting means <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is outputted as a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Also, the eighth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned on by the output signal of the second inverting means I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while the eighth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is turned off by the output signal of the first inverting means I<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Further, during the time when the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is transited to a HIGH state, the seventh NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned on while the ninth PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is turned off. Therefore, the potential of the output node of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is discharged into the ground terminal Vss via the seventh NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the eighth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the output signal of the sixth inverting means <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is outputted as a LOW state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The seventh inverting means I<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the first output unit <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> inverts the output signal of a LOW state to output the first address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Along with it, the first address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> outputted with a HIGH state as above is supplied to the third buffering means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the noise removing circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the first address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is delayed by the third buffering means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that is controlled by the second and third signal Ns and Ps generated by a given bias circuit, thus producing a delay signal DELAY of a LOW state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The delay signal DELAY is inputted to the OR gate S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> along with the first address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the delay signal DELAY and the address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are simultaneously logically combined to be supplied to the transfer means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a LOW state. The thirteenth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the transfer means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned on by a given fourth signal GLEN of a HIGH state while the fourteenth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the output signal of the OR gate S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is supplied to the tenth inverting means I<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the second output unit <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> via the thirteenth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, so that the transfer means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> produces an output signal of a LOW state. The tenth inverting means <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> again inverts the output signal of the transfer means <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to output the second address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in case that the address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a given noise transiting from a LOW state to a HIGH is supplied to the input terminal of the address transition detecting circuit so that the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> starts to transit to a LOW state, the address transition detecting circuit according to the present invention controls the potential on the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> not to be completely transited to a LOW state, using a control means constructed at a given portion of the address transition detecting circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, in case that the address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transited from a HIGH state to a LOW state, the address transition detecting circuit generates the pulse width of the first address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> same to that of the address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by allowing the potential on the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be recognized as a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Further, the first address transition detection signal ATDout<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is limited to the same size to the pulse width of the address buffer signal AF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the first output unit of the address transition detecting circuit and is removed by the noise removing circuit driven by a given delay circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the present invention has a control means for control charge/discharge of a given portion of the address transition detecting circuit in order to remove a noise of an address transition detection signal generated by a glitch signal included in a given signal applied to an input terminal of an address transition detecting circuit and also has a noise removing circuit for removing the noise included in the address transition detection signal in the output unit of the address transition detecting circuit. Therefore, the present invention can prevent generation of an unnecessary address transition detection signal pulse upon generation of a glitch and can thus stably drives semiconductor chips even at a high power supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
