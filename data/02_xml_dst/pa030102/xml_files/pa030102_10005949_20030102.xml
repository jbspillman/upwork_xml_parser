<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention is based on U.S. Provisional patent application Serial No. 60/302,219 filed on Jun. 29, 2001 and relates to a plate heat exchanger for the purpose of exchanging heat between two fluids and the method of constructing such an exchanger.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Heat exchangers developed up to the present time may generally be classified into two categories, namely tubular exchangers and plate exchangers. The conventional plate heat exchangers are manufactured by stacking a plurality of plates, configured in a way so that two fluids, one relatively hot and the other relatively cold, may be passed between alternating channels formed by the plates. Plate heat exchangers may be further broken down into two categories, namely gasket-containing heat exchangers and all-welded heat exchangers. Gasketed exchangers have many advantages over all welded exchangers, three of which being the accessibility of plates for cleaning, lower thermal stresses, and cost per area; however, distinct limitations are present. Gasket limitations occur with temperature, pressure, and compatibility with fluids used. To overcome these limitations, plate heat exchanger manufacturers have developed all welded plate heat exchangers. The major problem encountered with existing all welded units is the excessive thermal stresses present which leads to shorter equipment life. High manufacturing cost of separating the relatively hot and relatively cold fluid via common welding procedures and excessively thick heat transfer plates are other disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,914, issued on Nov. 28, 1995, Roger C. Davidson and Achint P. Mathur discloses an all welded plate heat exchanger essentially formed by stacking elongated heat transfer plates having solid metal fillers along the two elongated sides, continuous TIG welding the fillers to the plates, and welding inlet and outlet headers for two or more fluids. The continuous welding of the two elongated sides results in higher manufacturing cost and difficulties in allowing for the differential thermal expansion of the plates. In addition, this method eliminates the possibility of repairing common weld failures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,688,631, issued on Aug. 25, 1987, Andre Peze and Henry Fechner discloses a similar all welded plate heat exchanger essentially formed by welding pairs of plates containing multiple depressions thereby forming cassettes, via an electric seam welding method. The cassettes are then stacked while the extending flanges of the cassettes are bent ninety degrees and welded together, via an arc welding method, to seal off the secondary channels. The depressions are then spot welded to the adjacent plate for additional support. Inlet and outlet headers are then attached for two or more fluids. This solution improves the capacity of the exchanger to accommodate differential expansion; however, only slightly and at the expense of pressure containment. The need for relatively thick metal plates still appears to exist if substantial pressure ratings are to be obtained. In addition, repairs on the seam-welded cassettes do not appear feasible via this solution due to the continuous welding along the flange of the plates </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Neither of the above described heat exchangers, either individually or in combination, is seen to describe the present invention as claimed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The objective of the present invention is to construct a plate heat exchanger, which more efficiently accommodates manufacturing cost, thermal expansion, and pressure containment than prior developed plate heat exchangers. This objective is achieved according to the present invention by replacing the continuous sealing of the two sides of a pair of adjoining rectangular cassettes, in which electric seam welding has been performed, with baffle clips and enclosing such clips in headers extending the length of the cassettes. The presence of the full length headers allows the baffle clips to be applied without welding or with only partial welding because the baffle clips are only acting in the capacity to prevent cross-flow and not fluid containment. This method of construction allows the internal pressure of the secondary fluid to be contained via the full length headers which when provided with an arcuate cross-sectional shape can contain moderately high pressures with relatively thin material. The baffle clips may be altered or removed to better facilitate the collection and distribution of fluids during condensation and or evaporation processes.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, the plate heat exchangers to be described are shown containing basically a rectangular core, although other shapes are possible. It is the intention of the drawings to show sufficient detail necessary for a full understanding of the invention and in no way limit the method in which the invention is embodied. Other forms of the invention such as multi-pass flows, drainable piping, manifolding multiple units together, and enclosing entire exchanger inside of a pressure vessel, will be obvious to persons skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>thereof, a heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, made according to the present invention, is shown with a cutaway view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so as to call attention to the unique method of construction of this invention. The heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an outer housing consisting of a primary inlet header <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a primary outlet header <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a secondary inlet header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a secondary outlet header <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, four identical manifold flanges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a top cover member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and a bottom cover member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The headers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the flanges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the cover members <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> serve to enclose a plate pack assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> seen in its entirety in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Located within the housing are three identical cassettes, each identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that form a part of the plate pack assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> each cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is constructed from two identically formed rectangular heat transfer plates <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>the central body portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of each of which is formed with a plurality of parallel and angled corrugations or depressions. In forming a cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, one of the heat transfer plates <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is rotated 180 degrees and turned over so that one of the plates is superimposed upon the other. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, this causes the corrugations of each of the heat transfer plates <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to cross each other at a fixed angle and provide plurality of parallel and angled outer ridges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and inner ridges <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for each of the heat transfer plates <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the three cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> within the housing of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provide three primary channels <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for the flow of a primary fluid and two secondary channels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for the flow of a secondary fluid. The primary fluid enters the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by the arrow &ldquo;A through a primary inlet nozzle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which is rigidly connected to an arcuately shaped inlet header <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The primary fluid exits in the direction shown by the arrow &ldquo;B&rdquo; through a primary outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is rigidly connected to the arcuately shaped outlet header <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, primary fluid entering the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the primary inlet nozzle <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, flows through the primary channels <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and exits the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the primary outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The secondary fluid enters the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction of the arrow &ldquo;C&rdquo; via the secondary inlet nozzle <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, flows through the secondary channels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and exits in the direction of the arrow &ldquo;D&rdquo; through the secondary outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As should be apparent, the inlet nozzle <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are rigidly connected to the secondary inlet header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the secondary outlet header <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> More specifically and as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each heat transfer plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is integrally formed with a pair of identical laterally spaced side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> located in a common plane. Also, the opposed ends of each heat transfer plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is integrally formed with identical end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> each of which is offset from side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are also located in a common plane which is parallel to the plane of the side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the outer ridges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the corrugations formed in each of the heat transfer plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are at a higher level than the plane of the end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Thus, when each cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed by having one heat transfer plate rotated 180 degrees and inverted relative to the other heat transfer plate as mentioned hereinbefore, a rectangular opening is provided at each end of the cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by the end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The opening defines the entrance area for the primary fluid which flows through the primary channel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As also seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, after the heat transfer plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is rotated, inverted, and positioned below heat transfer plate <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> with the side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in contact with each other, a continuous resistance seam weld <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is provided along the length of each of the two connecting side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so as to form the cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into a single separate unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the design of the heat transfer body portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the two heat transfer plates <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which form a cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is such that there is sufficient plate to plate contact points between the outer ridges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, eliminating the need to spot weld adjacent cassettes for support. It will also be noted that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows three prefabricated cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in the stacked state prior to the insertion of rectangular cassette shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for TIG weld reinforcement. When the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are placed on top of each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the outer ridges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the corrugations of adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be in contact with each other to provide a secondary channel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for the flow of the secondary fluid. Inasmuch as the outer ridges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the corrugations are at a higher level than the end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as mentioned above, a gap or space of uniform height and depth will be provided between the end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> when stacked as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This gap or space is filled by use of the rectangular cassette shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> assist in the arc welding of relatively thin metal plates and are thereby not necessary for all designs, as plate thickness may vary. In this case, the shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are welded continuously along the end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> thus, in effect, interconnecting the stacked cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The plate pack assembly or core <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when fully assembled can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and includes the four cassette shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and eight cover plate shims. The cover plate shims consist of four identical side cover shims <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and four identical end cover shims <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The shims <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> essentially serve as a top and bottom support for each of the headers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The shims <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are sized so as to fill the space along the length of each of the side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> located at the top and bottom of the pack seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to have the inner surface of each of the top cover member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and bottom cover member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in contact with the outer ridges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the corrugations of the top and bottom cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the end cover shims <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are sized so as to fill the recess created by having the end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> at a different level than the outer ridges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the corrugations in each heat transfer plate as mentioned above. Thus, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, each end cover shim <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is approximately one-half the thickness of the cassette shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and has its upper planar surface in the same plane as the upper planar surface of the side cover shims <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In addition and as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, eight generally cube-shaped and identical channel separating bars <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are attached to the corners of the core of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to fill the spaces between adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> existing at the corners of such cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the exposed flat sides of the bars <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> lie in the same plane as the side edges and the end edges of the side cover shims <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In the preferred form, the shims <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are welded to the associated top and bottom cover members <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition, the plate pack assembly or core <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which are wedged in between the side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and tack welded at a few points to the vertically spaced side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each of the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is generally U-shaped in cross section, as seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and of equal length. The baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> serve to partially block the secondary channels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> along headers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and assure that the secondary fluid flows through the body portion of the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from the secondary inlet nozzle <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the secondary outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> The baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are arranged such that the primary and secondary fluids flow in a countercurrent pattern; however, may be arranged to produce co-current or cross-flow flow patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, on one side of the pack assembly where the secondary outlet header <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is located, start at the rear end of the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in contact with a bar <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and end about three-quarters of the way towards the front of the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to allow for an exit for the secondary fluid as it flows through the secondary channels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into the secondary outlet header <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on the side of the plate pack assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> where the secondary inlet header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is located, start at the front of the plate pack assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in contact with a bar <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and end approximately three-quarters of the way towards the rear of the pack assembly allowing for the secondary fluid to flow from the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the secondary channels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and finally into the header <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and exit through the secondary outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the top and bottom cover members <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are generally the same rectangular shape as the heat transfer plates <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>; however, they extend beyond the primary headers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and serve as the top and bottom portions of such headers. The manifold flanges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are welded to the plate pack assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to serve as both end-plugs and support for the secondary headers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which extend the entire length of the plate pack assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. This arrangement, in conjunction with the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, allows the pressure inside the secondary channels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be relatively equal to the pressure in the headers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and thereby eliminating the need to provide a continuous sealing weld between the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the cassettes adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The inlet and outlet headers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for the primary side are welded to the end portions of the top and bottom cover members <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and to the upper and lower ends of the plate pack assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that the seam welded cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are not welded to each other by a continuous weld. Instead the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are fastened to adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by a few tack welds along the side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Since the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are not welded together form the enclosure side wall of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, they are capable of expanding side ways and vertically at their side edges. This advantage is realized by having the secondary headers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have an arcuate cross sectional form as seen in of FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to allow for sideways expansion of the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In addition, at the rear ends of the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> along the header <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and at the front end of the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> along the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, small bleed holes (not shown) can be provided in the vertical section of the baffle clip <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to eliminate the dead re-circulation area that may occur in the two corners in the secondary channels <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is an isometric view of a modified version of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with rectangular carbon steel top and bottom plate-type support members <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having a plurality of vertically aligned holes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> adapted to receive bolts for interconnecting the plates <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The pressure containing support members <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> vary in thickness as a function of internal pressure and the size of the secondary headers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Since these support members <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> do not come in contact with the hot and cold fluids, they are typically made from carbon steel to reduce the cost of a heat exchanger. The support members <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> are not needed in low-pressure applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows three identically modified cassettes (each identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>) stacked without the use of the cassette shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as provided in the plate pack assembly of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Those parts of the cassette <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that are identical to those of the cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are identified by the same reference numerals but primed. In this instance, the plates <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of each of the cassette <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> have the outer ridges <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the corrugations in body of each plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> located at the same level as the end flanges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime;. In all other respects, the plates <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are identical to the corresponding heat transfer plates <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As mentioned above, the shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are used to improve the arc weld when attaching front and rear ends of adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that are formed of relatively thin metal. The plates <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> use thicker metal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, thereby eliminating the need for the shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the cassettes <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> could be substituted for the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and could be used for providing a plate pack assembly such as that in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> except for the absence of the shims <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is an isometric view of an alternate embodiment of the plate heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to this invention. In this case, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> would be used when the number of heat transfer plates in a given unit are increased to a point where they exceed an amount that corresponds to the secondary headers increase in chord length, and to the extent of increasing the thickness of the support members to an unfavorable thickness, from an economic standpoint. It will be noted that parts of the plate pack assembly of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is essentially the same in construction as that incorporated in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For this reason, the parts of the plate pack assembly of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that correspond to the parts of the plate pack assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are identified by the same reference numbers but double primed. It will also be noted that in this instance the modification of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of replacing the horizontal secondary headers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with several identical vertical secondary inlet headers <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> on one other side of the plate pack assembly and equal number of vertical secondary outlet headers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the other side of the plate pack assembly, thereby reducing the width of the top and bottom support members <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, respectively, which, in turn, reduces the thickness needed to contain a given pressure. Also, rather than having the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&Prime; fastened to the cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&Prime; as indicated with respect to the FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> version of the heat exchanger, this alternate embodiment utilizes vertical support bars <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> secured to the top and bottom side shims <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>&Prime; for maintaining the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>&Prime; in position. In all other respects and as mentioned above, the core or plate pack assembly of this heat exchanger <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is the same (except for the number of cassettes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&Prime;) as the core <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the respective primary and secondary flow patterns in a corrugated high chevron angle plate. The high chevron angle plates produce a relative low chevron angle for the secondary side entrance and exit portions, which results in the secondary side having a lower pressure drop relative to the primary side. A low chevron angle (&agr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) acts in a reverse manner, producing a higher chevron angle (&agr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in the secondary entrance and exit portions. A chevron angle of forty-five degrees or a dimple pattern produces equal geometric or chevron patterns for both fluids. This flexibility allows the exchanger to be designed more efficiently by better accommodating unequal flows or unequal pressure drop limitations without resorting to an uneven number of passes, thereby resulting in lower surface area and lower cost of the unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is cross sectional view of alternate heat transfer plates adapted to form a cassette such as the cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Note that those parts of such alternate heat transfer plates corresponding to the same parts of cassette <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are identified by the same reference numerals but triple primed. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, rather than having the baffle clips formed as separate U-shaped members such as the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the side flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; of the heat transfer plates are provided with vertically disposed dependent raised sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, respectively. Thus, when a pair of the heat transfer plates are interconnected as explained hereinbefore to form a cassette, ends of the sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contacting each other are tack welded to form a baffle clip which functions in the same manner as the baffle clips <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> provided in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Various changes and modifications can be made to the construction described above without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, rather than having corrugations or depressions of the type provided in the body of the heat transfer plates, other forms of depressions could be substituted for the corrugations, namely, dimples of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the aforementioned U S.
