<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of programming a multi-level flash memory using a sensing circuit according to the present invention performs an automatic verification program method of performing verification while performing a program. The method can reduce the power consumption by detecting a program data stored at a register to stop an operation of the sensing circuit for memory cells for which the program is completed. Also, a method of reading the flash memory senses the state of the threshold voltage of a cell using the sense amplifier used in the program operation while increasing or lowering the voltage applied to a control gate step-by-step and then stores the level value generated in a counter at the registers depending on its state, wherein an operation of the sensing circuit for the memory cells for which the program is completed is stopped. Therefore, the present invention can reduce the power consumption and allow a multi-level read to be implemented on an actual array with a simple sense amplifier structure step-by-step. In addition, the present invention can reduce the power consumption while simplifying the circuit construction by allowing a program/read operation to be simultaneously implemented on a single sense amplifier circuit. </paragraph>

Then, the comparison results X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;X<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are decoded by the decoder <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to represent information on at which step of the four levels the threshold voltage of the cell FMC is located using 2 (two) bit data MSB, LSB. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the sensing circuit for programming/reading the multi-level flash memory includes a PMOS transistor PM<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> a source of which is applied a power supply voltage VDD and drain and gate of which are commonly connected, wherein the commonly connected drain and gate is connected to a drain of a selected cell; a reference voltage generator <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for generating a reference voltage VREF a comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> one terminal of which is connected to the drain of the selected cell FMC and the other terminal of which is connector to the reference voltage VREF and a decoder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for decoding the output of the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to produce 2 bit data MSB, LSB. </paragraph>

The comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> senses whether a drain current flows in the cell FMC in every step to sense the control gate voltage in the step where the drain current starts to flow or the step where the current does not flow. Then, the decoder <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives the output of the comparator <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to represent information on at which step of the four threshold voltage levels the threshold voltage of the cell FMC is located using 2 (two) bit data MSB, LSB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the above, the conventional method of programming/reading the multi-level flash memory using the sensing circuit according to the first embodiment has disadvantages that it requires additional program circuit and its execution procedures are complicated. In addition, the method of reading the multi-level flash memory is simple in the operation of the circuit. However, there is a disadvantage that its sensing circuit becomes greater. Further, the conventional method of programming/reading the multi-level flash memory using the sensing circuit according to the second embodiment is simple and can be easily applied to a unit cell. However, there is a disadvantage that the method is difficult to be implemented within an actual memory array. In addition, there is an advantage that it requires circuits for program and read, respectively. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in detail by way of a preferred embodiment with reference to accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals are used to identify the same or similar parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> are flowcharts shown to explain a method of programming a multi-level flash memory using a sensing circuit according to the present invention; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating a program method up to a second level by selecting a memory cell depending on information stored at a register. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, data on what level a cell is to be programmed is stored at a register in order to program a flash memory (Step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). Each of cells includes a register just as much as the number of bits that could represent the number of the level depending on the program degree. For example, if there are four steps first&tilde;fourth levels depending on the programmed degree of the flash memory, that is, the threshold voltage, each of the cells requires two registers since the four steps are represented into 2 (two) bits &ldquo;11&rdquo;, &ldquo;10&rdquo;, &ldquo;01&rdquo;, &ldquo;11&rdquo; In the present invention, the case that the programmed degree of the flash memory is divided into four steps will be described as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> However, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited thereto but may be applied to the case that the programmed degree of the flash memory is more than four steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If data for programming a cell is stored at the register, a first word line voltage (Vp<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is applied to a memory cell and a reference cell (Step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). The first word line voltage (Vp<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is a medium voltage that is higher than the threshold voltage of a cell corresponding to a second level but is lower than the threshold voltage of a cell corresponding to a third level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> If the first word line voltage (Vp<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is applied, a first cell is specified (Step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> If the first cell is specified, whether the cell is programmed or not is determined depending on the data stored at the register of a corresponding cell (Step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). For example, if data stored at the register is &ldquo;11&rdquo;, it means that the threshold voltage of a first level is maintained without programming the cell. If data stored at the register is &ldquo;00&rdquo;, it means that a program must be completely performed up to a fourth level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> If the data stored at the register is not &ldquo;11&rdquo;, it is determined that the program is performed at least up to a second level. In order to raise the threshold voltage of the cell to the second level, the program is performed by an automatic verification program method (Step S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). If the drain current of the cell being programmed is compared with the reference current of the reference current supply circuit in the sense amplifier while programming the memory cell to complete the program, the program operation is finished. Therefore, the memory cell simultaneously performs the program and verification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If the data stored at the register is &ldquo;11&rdquo;, it means that the program will not be performed since the program will not be performed. In other words, if the data stored at the register is &ldquo;11&rdquo;, the program is not performed and the threshold voltage of the cell has a first voltage that is the lowest voltage in the first&tilde;fourth levels, so that upon a reading operation, data corresponding to &ldquo;11&rdquo; can be represented by allowing the largest drain current to flow. On the contrary, if the data stored at the register is &ldquo;00&rdquo;, the program is performed in every step and the threshold voltage of the cell has the fourth voltage that is the highest voltage in the first&tilde;fourth levels, so that upon a reading operation, data corresponding to &ldquo;00&rdquo; can be represented by allowing the smallest drain current to flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If all of given operations are completed depending on the data stored at the register, the cell number is increased (Step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If the cell number is increased to select a next cell, the above steps S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>&tilde;S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are again performed depending on the data stored at the register of the selected cell. If the cell for which the program is performed by the above operations is the last cell, the second level program step is finished and a third level program step is started (Step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the memory cell is programmed by the above program method, the program operation of the memory cell in which &ldquo;11&rdquo; is stored at the register and the memory in which &ldquo;10&rdquo; is stored at the register are all completed. Thus, the memory cell in which &ldquo;11&rdquo; is stored has the threshold voltage of the first level and the memory cell in which &ldquo;10&rdquo; is stored has the threshold voltage of the second level. Therefore, as the program operation of the memory cell in which &ldquo;11&rdquo; is stored at the register and the memory cell in which &ldquo;10&rdquo; is stored at the register is finished, a program operation for a memory cell in which &ldquo;11&rdquo; or &ldquo;10&rdquo; is stored at a registered will not be performed in the third level program step being a next step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating a program method up to a third level by selecting a memory cell depending on information stored at a register. A program method up to the third level performs a program only for remaining cells except that data stored at the register is &ldquo;11&rdquo; or &ldquo;10&rdquo;. The program method up to the third level is same to the program method up to the second level, except that a second word line voltage (Vp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is applied to a memory cell and a reference cell in order to perform the program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the second word line voltage (Vp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is applied to the memory cell and the reference cell in order to perform the program (Step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>). The second word line voltage (Vp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is a medium voltage that is higher than the threshold voltage of the cell corresponding to a third level but is lower than the threshold voltage of the cell corresponding to a fourth level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> If the second word line voltage (Vp<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is applied, the first cell is specified (Step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If the first cell is specified, it is determined that the cell is programmed or not depending on data stored at a register of a corresponding cell. For example, if the data stored at the register is &ldquo;11&rdquo; or &ldquo;10&rdquo;, the program is not performed but is selectively performed only for the remaining cells, since it means that the cell is programmed by a given threshold voltage in the second level program step (Step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> If the data stored at the register is not &ldquo;11&rdquo; or &ldquo;10&rdquo;, it is determined that the program will be performed at least up to a third level. Thus, in order to raise the threshold voltage of the cell to the third level, the program is performed using an automatic verification program method (Step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>). If the drain current of the cell being programmed is compared with the reference current of the reference current supply circuit in the sense amplifier while programming the memory cell to complete the program, the program operation is finished.

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> First, upon a program, the voltage VG of the control gate is increased in every step and the reference current IREF is maintained to be same, so that the a program is performed while the threshold voltage of the cell is raised step-by-step. The program is performed by repeatedly reading data stored in each step at the registers <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to determine whether the data will perform the program in a corresponding level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> If the data is &ldquo;11&rdquo;, an initial threshold voltage value is maintained. If the data is &ldquo;10&rdquo;, the program is performed in the first step. If the data is &ldquo;01&rdquo;, the program is performed in the first and second steps. If the data is &ldquo;00&rdquo;, the program is performed in the first, second and third steps. The threshold voltage of each of the cells is raised while the program is performed in each of the steps. As soon as the cell current ICELL is lowered than the reference current IREF the program is stopped by the output VREN of the second and third NMOS transistors NM<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and NM<highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and the inverter INV<highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the sense amplifier driving setting unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, upon a read operation, in the first step, the first level is sensed to discriminate the first level from the second, third and fourth levels. In the second step, the second level is sensed to discriminate the second level form the third and fourth levels. In the third step, the third level is sensed to discriminate the third level form the fourth level in a not-sensed cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> These read operations will be described in detail in every step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In the first step, all the registers <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are first set to 0 (zero) and the output of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is set to &ldquo;11&rdquo;. Thereafter, the control gate voltage VG of the memory cell FMC is set to a first voltage (Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) If the threshold voltage of the memory cell FMC is lower than that of the reference cell CREF the output of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is stored at the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. If the threshold voltage of a selected memory cell FMC is higher than the threshold voltage of the reference cell CREF the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> maintains intact its data stored as 0 (zero). At this time, the first voltage (Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is set to a value that is higher than the threshold voltage of the first level cell and is lower than the threshold voltage of the second, third and fourth level cell and the reference cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the second step, after the output of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is increased to &ldquo;10&rdquo; and the control gate voltage VG of the cell is increased to the second voltage (Vr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), columns of cells connected to the sense amplifier are sequentially sensed. In each of the column, an existing data of the register corresponding to its cell is read. If the existing data is &ldquo;11&rdquo;, the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is not driven but the output of the sense amplifier is floated to close the switching element <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> so that the output of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is not stored at the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. If the existing data is not &ldquo;11&rdquo;, a sensing is performed. At this time, if the threshold voltage of a selected cell FMC is lower than the threshold voltage of the reference cell CREF the output of the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> becomes logically HIGH by means of the second level cell, so that &ldquo;10&rdquo; being the output of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is stored at the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if the threshold voltage of the selected cell FMC is higher than the threshold voltage of the reference cell CREF the output of the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> becomes logically LOW by means of the third or fourth level cell to close the switching element <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> so that the output of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is not stored at the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> If all the sense amplifiers in the memory array perform simultaneously the above procedure by the number of column, the second step is finished. The first and second levels of each of the registers <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> in the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are sensed/written and the remaining levels are reset to 0 (zero). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the third step, after the output of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is increased to &ldquo;01&rdquo; and the control gate voltage VG of the cell is increased to the third voltage (Vr<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), columns of cells connected to the sense amplifier are sequentially sensed. In each of the column, an existing data of the register corresponding to its cell is read. If the existing data is &ldquo;11&rdquo; or &ldquo;10&rdquo;, the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is not driven but the output of the sense amplifier is floated to close the switching element <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> so that the output of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> does not enter the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. If the existing data is not &ldquo;11&rdquo; or &ldquo;10&rdquo;, a sensing is performed. At this time, if the threshold voltage of a selected cell FMC is lower than the threshold voltage of the reference cell CREF the output of the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> becomes logically HIGH by means of the third level cell, so that &ldquo;01&rdquo; being the output of the level state specification circuit is stored at the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if the threshold voltage of the selected cell FMC is higher than the threshold voltage of the reference cell CREF the output of the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> becomes logically LOW by means of the fourth level cell to close the switching element <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> so that the output of the level state specification circuit does not enter the register array <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> If all the sense amplifiers in the memory array perform simultaneously the above procedure by the number of column, the third step is finished. In the state of the register, the first, second and third level cells are sensed/written, and the remaining cells are maintained to be reset as the fourth level cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the above, description has been made on the case that the sensing circuit for programming/reading the above multi-level flash memory is a 4-level 2-bit cell. However, in case of having more than 4-level, if the bit number of the counter unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is same to the bit number of the cell and the number of the step is also below by one than the level number of the cell, a flash memory cell array having information of more than 2-bit in one cell can be applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from the above description, a method of programming/reading a multi-level flash memory using a sensing circuit according to the present invention can reduce the power consumption by comparing a current step and a previous data stored at a register upon a sensing in every step to stop an operation of a not-sensed sense amplifier. Further, the present invention can process data with a simple circuit by sending an output of a level state specification circuit to the register depending on the sensing result of the sensing circuit without a complicated calculation of the data processing or maintaining a previous level data. In addition, the present invention can improve the processing capability by locating a lot of sense amplifiers within a memory chip to extend the number of cells that are simultaneously processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
