More particularly to The invention relates is concerned with a circuit for clamping a word line voltage for use in devices driven by a high voltage and flash memory cells, which can generate a pumping voltage of a stable potential even in variations in the power supply voltage in the process of pumping the power supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, flash memory cells or specific devices are driven by higher voltage than a general power supply voltage. This higher voltage is generated by a pumping circuit and is controlled by a clamping circuit so that it can maintain a constant potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an operation of a conventional word line voltage clamping circuit will be below described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the conventional word line voltage clamping circuit includes a pumping signal generating means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for generating a pumping signal KICK to a pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to a first external signal CE; a pre-charging means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for pre-charging an output terminal; a first switching means N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for discharging the pumping node according to a second external signal ATD; a boosting capacitor Cb connected between the pumping node and the output terminal, which increases the potential of the output terminal by a coupling effect of a capacitor to generate the boosting voltage Vboot if the pumping signal KICK is applied; a reference voltage generating means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for generating a reference voltage according to the first external signal CE); and a clamping means <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> for comparing the reference voltage and the potential of the pumping node to adjust the potential of the pumping node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The pumping signal generating means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes an inverter I<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for inverting the first external signal CE, a second switching means P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for switching the power supply voltage VDD according to the output signal of the inverter I<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and first and second resistors R<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for dividing the power supply voltage VDD into given voltages, wherein the divided voltages are outputted to the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the pumping signal KICK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The clamping means <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes a comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> for comparing the reference voltage and the potential of the pumping node, a third switching means P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for switching the power supply voltage VDD to the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to the output signal of the comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, and a fourth switching means P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for switching the power supply voltage VDD to the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> depending on an output signal of an Exclusive NOR gate I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and Exclusive NOR gate I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the output signal of the comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the second external signal ATD as an input signal. At this time, the driving capability of the fourth switching means P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is higher than that of the third switching means P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the above, the pumping signal generating means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the pre-charging means <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the boosting capacitor Cb correspond to a basic construction of the bootstrap circuit which pumps the power supply voltage to produce a high voltage. In order to drive the bootstrap circuit, they receive a chip enable signal and an address transition detection signal. The first external signal CE corresponds to the chip enable signal and the second external signal ATD corresponds to the address transition detection signal ATD. If the first external signal CE is applied, the address signal input is allowed and the second external signal ATD is started to generate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> First, if the first external signal CE is initially applied while the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> maintains a discharging state by the first switching means N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the discharging state is stopped, the pumping signal KICK is generated in the pumping signal generating means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and is then applied to the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the reference voltage Vref is then generated in the reference voltage generating means <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. At this time, the pumping signal KICK generated by the pumping signal generating means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is lower than a target voltage, applied to the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and clamped to the target voltage by the clamping means <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in the clamping means <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> compares the reference voltage Vref and the potential of the pumping signal KICK of the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> determine the amount that will be additionally charged to the pumping signal KICK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In case that the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> must be charged with a small amount of the power supply voltage VDD by applying a high power supply voltage VDD, the comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> generates an output signal of a LOW level to make the third switching means P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a low driving capacity an on state. Thus, the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be additionally charged with the power supply voltage VDD, so that the potential of the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can reach the target potential. At this time, the Exclusive NOR gate I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates a signal of a HIGH level depending on the output signal of the comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the output signal of the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thus making the fourth switching means P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> an off state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in case that the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> must be charged with a large amount of the power supply voltage VDD by applying a low power supply voltage VDD, the comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> generates an output signal of a HIGH level to make the third switching means P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Also, the Exclusive NOR gate I<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates a signal of a LOW level depending on the output signal of the comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and the potential of the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so that the fourth switching means P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a high driving capacity has an off state. Therefore, the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be additionally charged with a large amount of the power supply voltage VDD so that the potential of the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can reach the target potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the clamping means <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> adequately discharges the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the power supply voltage VDD through the third or fourth switching means P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to generate the pumping signal KICK having the potential of a certain degree that can generate a target boosting voltage Vboot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to generate a constant boosting voltage Vboot even variations in the power supply voltage VDD, this type of the word line voltage clamping circuit must have the comparator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> being the power supply voltage detection means. In case of the power supply voltage VDD, though the power supply voltage supplier outside a chip supplies a stable power supply voltage VDD, the power supply voltage VDD within the chip is influenced by a bouncing effect due to the power consumption. In particular, loading in order to obtain the boosting voltage Vboot from the output terminal, the timing when detection is made is one that has to drive the boosting capacitor the pumping signal KICK of which has a great. Thus, this timing is sensitive to noise since a lot of power is consumed. Therefore, there is a disadvantage that the power supply voltage VDD detection method is weak to the noise. Also, as detection of the power supply begins after the second external signal ATD is changed from the HIGH level to the LOW level, there is a problem that the operating speed of the device is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In view of the power consumption of the word line voltage clamping circuit, there is a problem that the power consumption is increased since a current path is always formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the operation of initially discharging the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, there is formed a current path to the second resistor R<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the switching means N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the switching means P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the first resistor R<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Thus, there is generated a power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the operation of additionally charging the pumping node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a given power supply voltage in order to generate the boosting voltage Vboot, there is formed a current path to the second resistor R<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the pumping signal generating means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the third or forth switching means P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thus, there is generated a power consumption. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a circuit for claming a word line voltage capable of minimizing the power consumption and improving the operating speed, in a way that the voltage applied to a triple p-well being a body of a transistor for a voltage fall means is controlled to facilitate a DC operation bias setting, that is, a clamping voltage setting, the clamping operation is performed only when the pumped voltage is higher than a target voltage, and a current path is shielded using the switching means after the clamping operation is finished. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, if the first and second signals CE and ATD of a HIGH level are applied in the first period T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being an initialization step, the bootstrap circuit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> pumps the power supply voltage to generate the pumping voltage Vboot. Also, the reference voltage generating means <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> generates the reference voltage Vref depending on the first signal CE to apply it to the first input terminal of the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The control signal generating means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> generates the first and second control signals CLMP_EN and CLMP_ENb depending on the first&tilde;third signals CE, ATD and CLAMP. The third signal CLAMP initially applies a LOW level as an output signal of the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The discharging means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> does not operate depending on the third signal CLAMP being an initial output signal of the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An operation by which the first and second control signals CLMP_EN and CLMP_ENb are generated from the control signal generating means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> will be described as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If the first and second signals CE and ATD of a HIGH level is inputted to the first NAND gate I<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the first NAND gate I<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> generates a LOW signal, which is then inverted by the first inverter I<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. To the first input terminal of the first NOR gate I<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is applied a signal of a HIGH level inverted by the first inverter I<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and to the second input terminal is applied a signal of a HIGH level inverted by the first inverter I<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> via the first delay means I<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, so that the first NOR gate I<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> generates a signal of a LOW level. This LOW level signal is applied to the first input terminal of the third NAND gate I<highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>. Then, third NAND gate I<highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> generates the first control signal CLMP_EN of a HIGH level with no regard to the signal applied to the second input terminal. The third inverter I<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> inverts the first control signal CLMP_EN of a HIGH level to generate the second control signal CLMP_ENb of a LOW level. At this time, the width of the pulse generated by the first NOR gate I<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is increased by delaying the second signal ATD using the first delay means I<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, which is for overlapping with the third signal CLAMP. The width of the pulse generated by the second NOR gate I<highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is increased by delaying the third signal CLAMP using the second delay means I<highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, which generates the first control signal CLMP_EN with more longer and stable pulse to stabilize the compare voltage CLAMP_IN during the clamping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The first and second control signals CLMP_EN and CLMP_ENb are applied to the first and second transfer gates T<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the clamping control means <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Depending on the first and second control signals CLMP_EN and CLMP_ENb, the gate and drain terminals of the fourth transistor N<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to the first transfer gate T<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to enable the sub clamping control means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and the gate and drain terminals of the eighth transistor N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is connected to the second transfer gate T<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to enable the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. At this time, the voltage of each of the nodes B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&tilde;B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> generated in the sub clamping control means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is applied to the triple p-well of the sixth&tilde;eighth transistors N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&tilde;N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for voltage fall, that is included in the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> to adjust the threshold voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Explaining in more detail, the reference voltage Vref generated by the reference voltage generating means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is fallen by the threshold voltage by means of the first transistor N<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the sub clamping control means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The fallen potential of the first node B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is then applied to the triple p-well of the sixth transistor N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. The triple n-well of the sixth transistor N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected to the drain terminal and is supplied with the potential of the drain terminal. The potential of the first node B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is fallen by the threshold voltage by means of the second transistor N<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The fallen potential of the second node B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is then applied to the triple p-well of the seventh transistor N<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. The triple n-well of the seventh transistor N<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is connected to the drain terminal and is supplied with the potential of the drain terminal. In addition, the potential of the second node B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fallen by the threshold voltage by means of the third transistor N<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The fallen potential of the third node B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then applied to the triple p-well of the eighth transistor N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. The triple n-well of the eighth transistor N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is applied to the drain terminal and is supplied with the potential of drain terminal. The potentials of each of the node B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&tilde;B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> generated in the sub clamping control means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are applied to the triple p-wells of the sixth&tilde;eighth transistors N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&tilde;N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> so that the threshold voltages of the sixth&tilde;eighth transistors N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&tilde;N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> falls the pumping voltage Vboot by a given voltage through the transistor N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&tilde;N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for voltage fall, which are serially connected to the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. The main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> also applies a compare voltage CLAMP_IN to the second input terminal of the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> through the first transfer gate T<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the second period T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> compares the compare voltage CLAMP_IN generated in the clamping control means <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> with the reference voltage Vref generated in the reference voltage generating means <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. As the bootstrap circuit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> generates the pumping voltage Vboot higher than the target voltage, a compare voltage CLAMP_IN of a high potential is generated. Therefore, as the compare voltage CLAMP_IN is higher than the reference voltage Vref, the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> generates the third signal CLAMP of a HIGH level to drive the discharging means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The third signal CLAMP generated in the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> turns on the switching means N<highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> of the discharging means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and connects the output terminal OUT of the word line clamping circuit with the current source Is to discharge the pumping voltage Vboot of the output terminal OUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As the pumping voltage Vboot is discharged, the pumping voltage Vboot is lowered to the target voltage. Thus, the compare voltage CLAMP_IN is lowered to the reference voltage Vref. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the third period T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, if the compare voltage CLAMP_IN is lowered than the reference voltage Vref since the pumping voltage Vboot is discharged by the discharging means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> generates the third signal CLAMP of a LOW level to turn off the switching means N<highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> of the discharging means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> At this time, the control signal generating means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> generates the first control signal CLMP_EN with a LOW level and generates the second control signal CLMP_ENb with a HIGH level, while the third signal CLAMP is changed from a HIGH level to a LOW level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An operation by which the first and second control signals CLMP_EN and CLMP_ENb are generated in the control signal generating means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> will be described as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If the first signal CE of a HIGH level and the second signal ATD of a LOW level are applied to the first NAND gate I<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the first NAND gate I<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> generates the signal of a HIGH signal which is then inverted by the first inverter I<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. To the first input terminal of the first NOR gate I<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is applied the signal of a LOW level inverted by the first inverter I<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and to the second input terminal is applied the signal of a LOW level inverted by the first inverter I<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> via the delay means I<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, thus producing the signal of a HIGH level. The second NAND gate I<highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> are supplied with the first signal CE of a HIGH level and the third signal CLAMP of a LOW level to produce the signal of a HIGH level which is then inverted by the second inverter I<highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. To the first input terminal of the second NOR gate I<highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is applied the signal of a LOW level inverted by the second inverter I<highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and to its second input terminal is applied the signal of a LOW level inverted by the second inverter I<highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> via the second delay means I<highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, thus producing a signal of a HIGH level. The signals of a HIGH level generated in the first and second NOR gates I<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and I<highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are applied to the first and second input terminals of the third NAND gate I<highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> to produce the first control signal CLMP_EN of a LOW level. The third inverter I<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> inverts the first control signal CLMP_EN of a LOW level to generate the second control signal CLMP_ENb of a HIGH level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The first and second transfer gates T<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the clamping control means <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are turned off depending on the first and second control signals CLMP_EN and CLMP_ENb. Thereby, the clamping control means <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> does not operate. Also, as the fifth and tenth transistors N<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are turned on depending on the second control signal CLMP_ENb, the ground voltage is applied to the gate terminal of the fourth and eighth transistor N<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the fourth and eighth transistors N<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are turned off and a current path from the output terminal OUT of the word line clamping circuit to the ground terminal is thus shielded. The tenth transistor N<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that is turned on by the second control signal CLMP_ENb, connects the second input terminal of the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the ground terminal to stop an operation of the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As the operation of the comparator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is stopped and the switching means N<highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is turned off by the third signal CLAMP, the operation of the discharging means <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is stopped and the discharging operation of the pumping voltage Vboot adjusted to the target voltage is also stopped so that the target voltage can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, if the switching means S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> connecting the output terminal OUT of the word line clamping circuit and the word line terminal is made to be on, the pumping voltage Vboot adjusted to be the target voltage is applied to the word lines via the load resistor R<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the load capacitor C<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the above operation, the DC bias setting of the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> can be freed by applying the potentials of each of the node B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&tilde;B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the sub clamping control means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to the triple p-wells of the transistors N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&tilde;N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. That is, what the body voltage of each of the triple NMOS transistors is to control the threshold voltage by a body effect of each of the triple nMOS transistors. It is thus possible to control more easily and exactly the pumping voltage Vboot of the bootstrap circuit by adjusting the bias of the sub clamping control means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. As this is directly concerned with adjustment of the word line voltage, it means that adjustment of the word line clamping voltage level is flexible. Also, using the potential of the first&tilde;third nodes B<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&tilde;B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> generated by the sub clamping control means <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. It becomes insensitive to lot-to-lot and wafer-to-wafer variations of each of the triple nMOS transistors by biasing the triple p-well being a body of the triple nMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&tilde;N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the main clamping control means <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In particular, the word line clamping circuit performs the clamping operation only when the pumping voltage Vboot generated in the bootstrap circuit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> reaches the target voltage. After the clamping operation, all the current paths of the clamping control means <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are stopped to minimize the power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In case of the second signal ATD, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it may be a little longer than the pulse width inputted by the first delay means I<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of the control signal generating means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. This is for overlapping with the third signal CLAMP. In addition, in case of the third signal CLAMP, it may be longer than the pulse width initially generated by the second delay means I<highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the control signal generating means <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. This is totally to stabilize the signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from the above description, the present invention clamps the pumping voltage to a target voltage without detecting the power supply voltage. Therefore, the present invention can make the pumping voltage be insensitive to noises and after the clamping, can minimize the power consumption by precluding the current path. Also, the present invention can improve the speed without loss of a waiting time for performing the clamping and timing loss. Further, the present invention adjusts a body bias of the transistor for falling the voltage to allow easy clamping voltage setting and makes the clamping voltage be insensitive to lot-to-lot and wafer-to-wafer variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
