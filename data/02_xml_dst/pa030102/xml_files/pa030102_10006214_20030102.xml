<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional blood or fluid access device such as an A. V. F. is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and generally includes a tubular body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which has a needle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on a first end of the body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a fitting <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on a second end of the body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The fitting <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is connected to a hose through which medicine flows in the body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the needle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and into the vessels of patients. A clamp device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is connected to the body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so that the fluid in the body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is stopped to flow to the needle when the clamp device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is turned to a close position. Two wings <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extend from the body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A cap <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is mounted to the body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and encloses the needle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the operators will not be hurt by the needle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, for a nurse, during the frequent removal of the caps <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, it is possible that the fingers are hurt by the needle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and this could lead to a dangerous result for the nurse. Besides, the clamp device <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and the cap <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are two individual parts which are installed to the body <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> separately and are easily to get lost. </paragraph>
