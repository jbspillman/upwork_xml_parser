<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device including a wiring structure having an interconnect and redundancy fuse made of a material containing at least Cu and a method of fabricating the same, and is particularly preferably applicable when a Cu interconnect is formed by the damascene process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recently, as the degree of integration of semiconductor elements increases and the chip size decreases, the microfabrication of interconnects and the formation of multi-level interconnects are advancing acceleratedly. In a logic device having this multi-level interconnect, a wiring delay is becoming one dominant cause of a device signal delay. The device signal delay is proportional to the product of the wiring resistance and the wiring capacitance. Accordingly, it is important to reduce the wiring resistance and the wiring capacitance in order to reduce the wiring delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To reduce the wiring resistance, therefore, the formation of a Cu interconnect is being studied. Especially in a global wiring portion having large influence on the wiring delay, the combination of a low-dielectric-constant film and a Cu interconnect greatly helps improve the device performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a common semiconductor device, a redundancy fuse is formed to obtain redundancy of, e.g., an interconnect. For the sake of convenience, this fuse is formed by the same metal as used for an interconnect. Accordingly, in a semiconductor device using a Cu interconnect, the use of Cu as a material not only for an interconnect but also for a redundancy fuse is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> When Cu is used as the material of a redundancy fuse and the fuse is to be cut by a laser beam, it is necessary to select a laser wavelength causing no damage to Si as the main component of this semiconductor device. However, the absorptance to Cu at this wavelength of a laser beam is low, so a laser beam having this wavelength cannot meet variations in the thickness of the redundancy fuse. This makes reliable cutting impossible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To solve this problem, the formation of a light absorbing layer on a Cu redundancy fuse is proposed as disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2000-323580 and 2000-208635. By this method, a redundancy fuse can be cut by a laser beam having the above wavelength. However, after this cutting step, a bias must be applied to the cut portion of the redundancy fuse in order to determine which memory cell is effective. During this determination, corrosion occurs in the cut portion owing to humidity and the bias, and this cut portion which is once cut and insulated is again connected. As a consequence, the device can no longer operate as a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As described above, the use of Cu as a wiring material can reduce the wiring resistance and suppress the wiring delay, but poses a serious problem that the effective formation and use of a semiconductor device become difficult. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in consideration of the above problem, and has as its object to provide a semiconductor device including a Cu interconnect and a Cu-containing fuse, which allows the fuse to be stably and reliably cut and, after the cutting, does not produce any inconvenience such as corrosion even in a normal temperature&middot;humidity (e.g., a temperature of 27&deg; C. and a humidity of 60%) atmosphere, thereby preventing defective operations and achieving high reliability, and to provide a method of fabricating the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present inventors made extensive studies and have reached various aspects of the invention presented below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is a semiconductor device comprising a wiring structure having an interconnect and fuse made of a material containing at least Cu. The present invention is characterized in that the fuse comprises an alloy material consisting of a metal capable of forming a metal oxide and Cu, and a metal material which covers the surrounding surface of the alloy material and has absorption to the wavelength of a laser beam used to cut the fuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this device, the metal material is preferably one member or a combination of two or more members selected from the group consisting of Ti, TiN, W, WN, Ta, TaN, and TiW. Also, the metal capable of forming the metal oxide is preferably one member or a combination of two or more members selected from the group consisting of Mg, Zr, Al, and Be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A large addition amount by which a film of the metal oxide is reliably formed when the fuse is cut is necessary. Therefore, the content of the metal capable of forming the metal oxide in the alloy material is favorably a value within the range of 1 to 10 atm %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, attempts using Cu alloys in the formation of interconnects have been made (e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-54458). In any of these attempts, to avoid a rise of the resistivity of Cu caused by nonuniform diffusion of added metals, the addition amount of a metal is restricted to a low-concentration range, i.e., 0.05 to 6 atm % when the added metal is Mg, and 0.05 to 0.3 atm % when the added metal is Al. In contrast, in the present invention a Cu alloy is primarily used in the formation of a fuse. Therefore, unlike the conventional attempts, the range of the addition amount of the added metal is the above-mentioned value, since the range need only be the one within which no flocculation occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, even when the fuse is irradiated with a laser beam having a wavelength selected to prevent damage to Si, the fuse is reliably cut because the metal material covering the surrounding surface of the alloy material well absorbs the laser beam. In addition, the alloy material in the cut portion thermally diffuses by an abrupt temperature rise, and the metal (other than Cu) in the alloy material oxidizes in the atmosphere. The stable metal oxide produced sticks to the cut surfaces of the fuse to form a film in self-alignment. This film functions as a protective film to prevent the generation of corrosion. In the present invention as described above, even when Cu interconnects are used in a semiconductor device and a Cu alloy is also used as a fuse accordingly, it is possible to reliably cut the fuse and protect the cut surfaces.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment will be described below. In this embodiment, a semiconductor device including a wiring structure having a Cu multi-level interconnect and a redundancy fuse, as the main constituent elements of the present invention, and a method of fabricating the same will be explained. For the sake of convenience, the structure of the semiconductor device will be explained along with its fabrication method. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> More specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, element isolation is performed on a silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by LOCOS or STI. In this embodiment, STI is used to form an element isolation structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by filling a trench formed in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with an insulator, thereby defining an element active region. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A method by which the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device fabricated as above is cut to correct a defective portion formed during the fabrication process will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> are schematic sectional views showing the redundancy fuse and its vicinity when the fuse is cut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, that portion of the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to a prospective cut portion of the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is irradiated with a laser beam. The selected wavelength of this laser beam is hardly absorbed by silicon so as not to cause any damage to the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For example, preferred cutting conditions are a laser wavelength of 1.3 &mgr;m, a laser energy of 1.0 &mgr;J, a pulse width of 12 nsec, and a spot diameter of 2.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> When the laser beam is emitted under the above cutting conditions, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, the irradiated portions of the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the SiN film <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> evaporate. In addition, since the TiN film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> has high absorptance to a laser beam having this irradiation condition (wavelength), the TiN film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> well absorbs this laser beam to cause an abrupt temperature rise. As a consequence, the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is cut in the irradiated portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the cut portion of this redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> thermally diffuses by the abrupt temperature rise, and Al preferentially combines with oxygen because Al is baser than Cu. Accordingly, Al oxidizes in the atmosphere, and AlO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>as the stable metal oxide produced sticks to the cut surfaces of the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to form a film <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in self-alignment. This film functions as a protective film to prevent the generation of corrosion. In this embodiment as described above, even when Cu interconnects are used in a semiconductor device and a Cu alloy is also used as the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> accordingly, it is possible to reliably cut the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and protect the cut surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In addition, after the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is cut, the cut surfaces can also be irradiated with a laser beam having energy lower than that of the above laser beam. More specifically, the cut surfaces are heated by irradiation by setting the laser energy to 0.01 &mgr;J, the pulse width to 100 nsec, and the spot diameter to 5.0 &mgr;m. This further ensures the protection of the cut surfaces by the film <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and improve the reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the TiN film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is formed as a film for covering the surrounding surface (the entire surface in this embodiment) of the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. However, any metal material having absorption to the wavelength of a laser beam used to cut the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be used. For example, instead of TiN it is possible to preferably use one member or a combination of two or more members selected from Ti, W, WN, Ta, TaN, and TiW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> To check the thickness of a metal material film suited to holding high absorption to the wavelength of a laser beam, the relationship between the film thickness and the light absorptance was simulated for a TiN film, Ti film, TaN film, and Ta film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The experimental results are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>.

The experiments were conducted by forming a metal material film on the upper surface of a Cu layer in each of FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and by forming a metal material film on the side surfaces of a Cu layer in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, when a metal material film was formed on the upper surface of a Cu layer, a film thickness of 20 nm or more was necessary to obtain sufficient absorptance (about 0.2 or more). When a metal material film was formed on the side surfaces of a Cu layer, a film thickness of 60 nm or more was necessary to obtain sufficient absorptance (about 0.2 or more). In this embodiment, sufficient absorptance is ensured because the TiN film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> about 100 nm thick is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Although an example in which the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed is disclosed above, a semiconductor device need only contain a metal which is baser than Cu and can form a metal oxide earlier than Cu when contacting the atmosphere. Therefore, it is also preferable to form a Cu alloy film by using one element selected from Mg, Zr, and Be, instead of Al, or by using a combination of two or more elements selected from Mg, Zr, Be, and Al. Similar to the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film, the addition amount of these metals is favorably a value within the range of 1 to 10 atm %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, criteria for the selection of a Cu alloy as the constituent element of the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As described above, this embodiment can implement a semiconductor device including Cu interconnects and a Cu-containing fuse, which allows the redundancy fuse to be stably and reliably cut and, after the cutting, does not produce any inconvenience such as corrosion even in a normal temperature&middot;humidity (e.g., a temperature of 27&deg; C. and a humidity of 60%) atmosphere, thereby preventing defective operations and achieving high reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Next, the second embodiment of the present invention will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as in the first embodiment, a semiconductor device including a wiring structure having a Cu multi-level interconnect and a redundancy fuse and a method of fabricating the same will be explained. The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that the steps of fabricating the redundancy fuse are slightly different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>B are schematic sectional views showing the method of fabricating the semiconductor device according to the second embodiment in order of steps. For the sake of convenience, the same reference numerals as in the semiconductor device explained in the first embodiment denote the same constituent members, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted. Also, the structure of the semiconductor device will be explained along with its fabrication method as in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> First, similar to the first embodiment, a MOS transistor structure and a lower wiring layer including first interconnects <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and second interconnects <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are formed through the steps shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>A, an Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> about 100 nm thick serving as a diffusion barrier (passivation) on the surfaces of the second interconnects <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is deposited. After that, an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> about 2 &mgr;m thick is formed as a dielectric interlayer, and the surface layer of this SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is planarized by CMP until the film thickness becomes about 1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>B, the Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are patterned to form via holes <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> partially exposing the surfaces of the second interconnects <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A, a</cross-reference> TiN film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> about 70 nm thick, a Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> about 700 nm thick, and another TiN film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> about 70 nm thick are formed in this order by sputtering. The Al addition amount of the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is preferably a value within the range of 1 to 10 atm %, since a large addition amount by which a metal oxide film can be reliably formed is necessary when a redundancy fuse is cut. In this embodiment, the Al addition amount is 0.8 atm %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As in the first embodiment, an example in which the TiN film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is formed as a film for covering the surrounding surface of the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is disclosed above. However, any metal material having absorption to the wavelength of a laser beam used to cut a redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be used. For example, instead of TiN it is possible to preferably use one member or a combination of two or more members selected from Ti, W, WN, Ta, TaN, and TiW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Also, although an example in which the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed is disclosed above, a semiconductor device need only contain a metal which is baser than Cu and can form a metal oxide earlier than Cu when contacting the atmosphere. Therefore, it is also preferable to form a Cu alloy film by using one element selected from Mg, Zr, and Be, instead of Al, or by using a combination of two or more elements selected from Mg, Zr, Be, and Al. Similar to the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film, the addition amount of these metals is favorably a value within the range of 1 to 10 atm %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film (not shown) about 1 &mgr;m thick is formed on the TiN film <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by plasma CVD and patterned to form an etching mask. This etching mask is used to pattern the upper and lower TiN films <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at a substrate temperature of 230&deg; C. to 270&deg; C. by using Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas as an etching gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Consequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>B, the right-hand region forms a fuse region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and the left-hand region forms a wiring region <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the fuse region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is formed which fills the via hole <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and consists of the TiN films <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> vertically sandwiched by these TiN films <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. In the wiring region <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an upper wiring layer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is formed which similarly consists of the TiN films <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> vertically sandwiched by these TiN films <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> After that, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, an SiN film <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> about 100 nm thick and an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> about 400 nm thick are formed as cover films, thereby completing a semiconductor device having the wiring structure described previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> When the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor device with the above arrangement is to be cut under the same conditions as in the first embodiment, the irradiated portions of the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the SiN film <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> evaporate. In addition, since the TiN films <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> have high absorptance to a laser beam having this irradiation condition (wavelength), these TiN films <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> well absorb this laser beam to cause an abrupt temperature rise. As a consequence, the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is cut in the irradiated portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The Cu&mdash;Al alloy film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the cut portion of this redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> thermally diffuses by the A abrupt temperature rise, and Al preferentially combines with oxygen because Al is baser than Cu. Accordingly, Al oxidizes in the atmosphere, and AlO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>as the stable metal oxide produced sticks to the cut surfaces of the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to form a film <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in self-alignment. This film functions as a protective film to prevent the generation of corrosion. In this embodiment as described above, even when Cu interconnects are used in a semiconductor device and a Cu alloy is also used as the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> accordingly, it is possible to reliably cut the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and protect the cut surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Similar to the first embodiment, after the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is cut, the cut surfaces can also be irradiated with a laser beam having energy lower than that of the above laser beam. More specifically, the cut surfaces are heated by irradiation by setting the laser energy to 0.01 &mgr;J, the pulse width to 100 nsec, and the spot diameter to 5.0 &mgr;m. This further ensures the protection of the cut surfaces by the film <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and improve the reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As described above, this embodiment can implement a semiconductor device including Cu interconnects and a Cu-containing fuse, which allows the redundancy fuse <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to be stably and reliably cut and, after the cutting, does not produce any inconvenience such as corrosion even in a normal temperature-humidity (e.g., a temperature of 27&deg; C. and a humidity of 60%) atmosphere, thereby preventing defective operations and achieving high reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Although a redundancy fuse is used as a fuse in each of the above embodiments, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments. For example, the fuse of the present invention is also applicable to a blown interconnect for performing programming, as well as to a redundancy fuse. A ROM including this blown interconnect is called an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). High reliability of the product can be ensured by using Cu interconnects in this ROM and the fuse of the present invention as a blown interconnect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As has been described above, it is possible to interconnect and a Cu-containing fuse, which allows the fuse to be stably and reliable cut and, after the cutting, does not produce any inconvenience such as corrosion even if exposed to the atmosphere, thereby preventing defective operations and achieving high reliability. </paragraph>
