<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> showing the system diagram for two toy&apos;s intercommunication. For instance of two dog toys&apos; intercomunication, the dog toys <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can call or respond each other by way of wireless communication. For example, the dog toy <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> gives a bark, and the hardware will send a command requiring a response to the dog toy <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When the dog toy <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives the command, it will respond the bark sound. The same principle may apply to other intercommunications easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In general, the contents of the intercommunication includes every voice, song, and action according to the present invention. These data of the voice, song and action may be updated from the web site of the internet or the CD-ROM provided by the toy maker. The toys have a communication interface which can connect to the computer for updating the new version software. The computer interface includes the serial port, the parallel port, the USB port, the game port, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the hardware block diagram of the intercommunicating toy.
