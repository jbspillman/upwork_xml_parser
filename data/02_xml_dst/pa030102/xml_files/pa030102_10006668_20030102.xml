<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims the priority of European Patent Application No. 01 116 015.7 filed Jul. 2, 2001, the disclosure of which is being incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an optoelectronic device for detecting labels with defined contrast patterns. In particular, the optoelectronic device can be embodied as a barcode reader. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Optoelectronic devices of this type comprise a transmitter for emitting light rays, a receiver for received light rays, as well as a deflection unit with a motor-driven polygonal mirror wheel. The transmitted light rays and the received light rays are guided over the polygonal mirror wheel. As a result of the rotational movement of the polygonal mirror wheel, the transmitted light rays are deflected such that they periodically sweep across an area where the labels are located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The transmitted light rays are guided across the labels in order to scan the patterns thereon. The received light rays, which are reflected back by the labels, are amplitude modulated in accordance with the label contrast pattern. The correspondingly modulated receiving light signals at the receiver output are evaluated in an evaluation unit for detecting the labels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The polygonal mirror wheel is motor-driven, so that the polygonal mirror wheel performs a rotational movement with a predetermined speed. Commercially available motors with an integrated motor control are normally used for this. The motor is additionally provided with a shaft. A mechanical holding fixture is attached to this shaft and the polygonal mirror wheel is mounted on the top of this fixture. For this, the polygonal mirror wheel preferably is provided with a mounting support for screwing on the holding fixture. The shaft itself is inserted into a bearing and is secured there with fastening means. The motor control is connected via cable to the evaluation unit, which is arranged on a separate printed circuit board. The cable end is provided with a contacting plug that is plugged into a corresponding socket on the evaluation unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The disadvantage of a deflection unit with this type of design is that it comprises a plurality of electrical and mechanical components. The assembly of these components is time-consuming and thus represents an undesirably high cost factor when producing the optoelectronic device. In addition, the tolerances of the individually produced components lead to problems with the accuracy of the deflection units produced in this way. Finally, deflection units with this type of design have an undesirably large structural size. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is the object of the invention to develop a deflection unit for an optoelectronic device of the aforementioned type, which has the smallest possible structural size at the lowest possible production cost, and with a smaller number of production parts than known optoelectronic devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The features of the optoelectronic device according to the invention are designed to solve this problem. Advantageous embodiments and useful modifications of the invention are described in the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The optoelectronic device according to the invention is used to detect labels with defined contrast patterns and comprises a transmitter for emitting light rays, a receiver for receiving light rays from a label and for generating receiving signals and a deflection unit with a motor-driven polygonal mirror wheel. The transmitted light rays are guided over the polygonal mirror wheel in order to scan the labels and the reflected, received light rays are also guided across the polygonal mirror wheel. The optoelectronic device according to the invention furthermore comprises an evaluation unit for evaluating the receiving signals present at the receiver. The motor for driving the polygonal mirror wheel has a drive shaft and is provided with a magnet, which is embodied as an injection-molded part. The magnet is molded onto the shaft and operates jointly with at least one coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One essential advantage of the device according to the invention is that the shaft with molded-on magnet forms an extremely compact structural unit that can be produced inexpensively. In particular, no additional adapters or the like are required to connect the drive shaft to the magnet. As a result, the motor for driving the polygonal mirror wheel can be produced efficiently with a small number of individual parts and with extremely small dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage is that the shape of the magnet can be specified freely due to the injection-molding procedure, which forms the magnet. In particular, the outside contour of the magnet can be designed such that the polygonal mirror wheel is fitted directly onto the magnet and can be secured, for example, by gluing it on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Separate mechanical means for attaching the polygonal mirror wheel to the magnet are not required according to the invention, which results in a further reduction of the individual parts and thus a further lowering of the assembly and material costs when producing the deflection unit. The size of the deflection unit is additionally reduced further with this type of design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the motor is mounted directly on a printed circuit board with an integrated evaluation unit. As a result, the motor, which operates jointly with the coil, is thus actuated directly via this evaluation unit. Consequently, a separate motor control, as well as an electrical cable and plug connection between a motor control of this type and the evaluation unit may be dispensed with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The drive shaft according to the invention rotates inside a bearing. The bearing is positioned inside a tube. In an embodiment of this type, the tube with the bearing for guiding the motor shaft and the coil, which operates jointly with the magnet, rest on the printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the motor shaft is inserted with its lower end into a bearing bore that opens up at the tube top. The motor shaft does not need to be secured inside the bearing, which is particularly advantageous as it is possible to dispense with additional means for securing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As a result of this structure, the shaft can be moved in a longitudinal direction; but this movement is limited by an end stop, formed by a housing ceiling of the optoelectronic device. The housing ceiling is located close to the upper edge of the shaft, provided the shaft is in the desired position. If the shaft with magnet is moved upward inside the bearing bore, for example as a result of impact on the device, the end stop will push the shaft back to its desired position without this hindering the rotational movement of the deflection unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A device according to the invention of this type requires only a small number of mechanical and electronic individual components and as a result, can be produced inexpensively.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the basic layout of an optoelectronic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for detecting labels provided with defined contrast patterns. In principle, the labels can have optional sequences and shapes for adjoining light/dark areas, preferably black and white areas. Barcodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> form the labels for the present exemplary embodiment. The barcodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> essentially consist of a series of black and white line elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a defined length and width. The optoelectronic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> consequently is a barcode reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The optoelectronic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a transmitting element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as well as an evaluation unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The transmitting element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> consists of a transmitter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, preferably a laser diode, as well as a transmitting optic <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that is installed in front of the transmitter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and is designed to focus the transmitted light rays <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The focused transmitted light rays <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are deflected via a rotating polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and are guided across the barcode symbol <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be detected. The rotational axis for the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is arranged perpendicular to the equatorial plane, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, of the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As a result of the rotational movement of the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the transmitted light rays <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are periodically guided inside a predetermined angular range in the equatorial plane that forms the scanning plane. In the process, barcodes <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be read within a predetermined distance range, corresponding to the focusing of the transmitted light rays <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is provided with eight mirror surfaces <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the form of facets on which the transmitted light rays <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are deflected. Corresponding to the number of facets of the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the transmitted light rays <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> periodically sweep across an angular range of &Dgr;&agr;&equals;90&deg;. With the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the scanning plane in which the transmitted light rays <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are guided is positioned in the equatorial plane of the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The received light rays <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that are reflected by the barcode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are guided over the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> consists of a receiver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is designed as a photodiode and converts the received light rays <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to an electrical receiving signal. An amplifier <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected behind the receiver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A receiving optic <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected in front of the receiving element <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to improve the detection sensitivity. The receiving signal present at the output of receiver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is supplied to the evaluation unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the contrast pattern for barcode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the received light rays <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that are reflected on this barcode are amplitude modulated. The output electrical receiving signal indicating the received light rays <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the receiver <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shows a corresponding amplitude modulation. Based on this amplitude modulation, the contrast pattern for the barcode <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is reconstructed in the evaluation unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with the aid of the receiving signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an exemplary embodiment of a deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, of which the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a component. In addition, the deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises a motor for driving the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, so that this wheel performs a rotational movement with a predetermined speed. This motor comprises a shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, on which the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is rotationally positioned, as well as a coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that operates jointly with this coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The motor is arranged on a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with an integrated evaluation unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The motor is actuated directly via the evaluation unit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is directly connected to the motor via printed circuit board <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As a result, it is possible to dispense with separate electronic components and adapters for the motor control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> contains a bore <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. A tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which projects perpendicularly from printed circuit board <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, is positioned inside bore <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably is a hollow-cylindrical plastic part that is open on the top and the bottom. Alternatively, tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be made of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is secured inside tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, at the inside wall of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is designed to accommodate shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and extends in a longitudinal direction of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, along its symmetry axis S. Bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is preferably designed as a sliding bearing, ball bearing or roller bearing and is provided with a central bearing bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that extends in the longitudinal direction of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, symmetrical to the symmetry axis S of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. An upper end of bearing bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is adjacent the open top of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The bottom of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is closed off with a bottom part <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which extends in a horizontal plane that is parallel to the plane of printed circuit board <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is designed as injection-molded part and is molded onto shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. For the injection-molded part, magnetic materials such as iron or the like are mixed into a molding material that can be poured, e.g. a plastic material, such that the magnetic materials are finely distributed with the molding material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> molded onto the upper portion of shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. To secure magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> safely on shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the shaft is provided with a groove <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extending in circumferential direction. The molding material that forms magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is injected into this groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a symmetrical molded part that encircles shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is fitted on top of and against the side surface of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The top surface of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is essentially a flat, circular-disk shaped area while the side surface of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical shell surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> One component of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is an essentially hollow-cylindrical guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which projects from the top surface of the molded part. Preferably, guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may have a conical shell surface, wherein the outside diameter of guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is tapered toward its upper edge. Guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is arranged in the center of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and is arranged symmetrical to the symmetry axis S of symmetrical magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> encompasses the upper portion of shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and thus improves the support of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The top of guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is level with the top of shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be an injection-molded plastic part with mirror surfaces <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>applied to its outer shell surface. Mirror surfaces <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are applied, preferably by evaporating and depositing a light-reflecting layer thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> essentially is basically made from a circular disk segment and side walls of which project downward from edges of the disk segment to form a single unit together with the disk segment. The underside of the disk segment is mounted to the top surface of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The insides of the side walls of polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> enclose a cylindrical hollow space, which is adapted to the outside contour of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The circular disk segment of the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is provided with a central, circular bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the diameter of which is adapted to the outside diameter of the hollow-cylindrical guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is fitted onto magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for mounting the deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is secured thereon with adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The underside of the circular disk segment of polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is secured in this way on magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, so that the insides of the side walls extending from the disk segment form-fit the outside contour magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> can be designed so that a space remains between the insides of the side walls for the polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the outside contour or shell surface of magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the molded part that forms magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> projects through the bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the circular disk segment, wherein the edges of the bore <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> fit closely against the guide segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> together with magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, forms a single structural unit. Shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the single structural unit is inserted into the bearing bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in order to mount deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on printed circuit board <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows that once deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is fully installed, the lower end of shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> rests on bottom <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The lengths of shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are dimensioned so that, when assembled, an air gap remains between the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and an air gap exists between coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the underside of the magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Thus, the rotation of the rotatably positioned structural unit including shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is not obstructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> To keep the structural volume of deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as small as possible, the molded part that forms the magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is provided with a central, symmetrical recess <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Recess <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed at the lower edge of the molded part that faces coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when assembled. Tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> projects into recess <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. As a result, a flat and space-saving design is obtained for deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, despite the relatively large height of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, resulting from the structural shape of the bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The side walls of polygonal mirror wheel <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> project downward over magnet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and, in the process, partially cover the coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As a result, it is possible to obtained sufficiently large mirror surfaces <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for deflecting transmitted light rays <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and received light rays <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, even with a relatively, flat structural shape for deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Optoelectronic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be integrated into one housing. In this case, the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with the motor arranged thereon rests on the housing bottom <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The housing ceiling <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> extends just barely above the upper edge of the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> This embodiment of optoelectronic device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is particularly advantageous, since the shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> only need be inserted into bearing bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. That is, shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> does not need to be secured on bearing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In case of external interference, for example if impact stresses occur, shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be moved to some degree upward inside bearing bore <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, this translational movement is limited by housing ceiling <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, which functions as an end stop. Since housing ceiling <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> extends just above the upper edge of shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, small deflections of shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can push it against housing ceiling <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. As a result of the rebound and the attraction of the magnet toward coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, shaft <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is returned to its starting position. Consequently, deflection unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> continues to rotate without any operational impairment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described in detail with respect to preferred embodiments, and it will now be apparent from the foregoing to those skilled in the art, that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects, and the invention, therefore, as defined in the appended claims, is intended to cover all such changes and modifications that fall within the true spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
