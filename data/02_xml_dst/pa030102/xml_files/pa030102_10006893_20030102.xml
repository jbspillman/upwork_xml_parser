<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to a flash memory device. More particularly to, the invention is concerned with a flash memory device capable of reducing the chip size and improving the program speed of a selected cell, by applying a given voltage to a source of a not-selected cell in order to increase the threshold voltage of the not-selected cell during the selected cell is programmed, and compensating for reduction in the threshold voltage of the not-selected cell due to a drain coupling depending on the drain voltage supplied to bit lines of the selected cell </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A conventional flash memory device includes a NOR-type flash memory cell array <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a decoder unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for controlling the word lines of the cell, and a multiplexer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for controlling the bit lines and the source lines of the cell, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The decoder unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of a plurality of unit circuit units <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>depending on inputted pre-decoding signals XPREA and XPREB, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. Each of the unit circuit elements is supplied with a first supply power voltage VPPX being a positive high voltage, a reset signal XRST, and a second supply power voltage VEEX being a negative high voltage. For convenience, the construction of the decoder unit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is substituted with a circuit construction for receiving the first pre-decoding signal XPREA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A first PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> driven by the reset signal XRST is connected between the third power supply terminal Vcc and the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> driven by the first pre-decoding signals XPREA<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, a fourth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> driven by the second pre-decoding signals XPREB<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and a fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> driven by a sector signal SECTOR is serially between the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a ground terminal Vss. A second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> driven by the potential of the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected between the first power supply terminal VPPX and the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A third PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> driven by the potential of the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected between first power supply terminal VPPX and the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A second NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> driven by the third power supply terminal Vcc is connected between the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> being a triple NMOS transistor, that is driven by the potential of the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is connected between the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second power supply terminal VEEX. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, the multiplexer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is divided into a portion for controlling bit lines and a portion for controlling source lines of each of the cells. The multiplexer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for controlling the source lines includes a NMOS transistor connected between the source line and the ground terminal Vss. Each of the NMOS transistors is driven by a source control signal SOCTRL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A method of programming a conventional flash memory device mentioned above will be now described by reference to the operating timing chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If a program command, a program address and a program data are inputted, the reset signal XRST is transited from a LOW state to a HIGH state. On the other hand, the first pre-decoding signal XPREA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the second pre-decoding signals XPREB<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the sector signal SECTOR, which are selected by the program address, are transited from a LOW state to a HIGH state. Therefore, the first PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is turned off by the reset signal XRST of a HIGH state. Also, the fourth and fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are turned on by the second pre-decoding signals XPREB<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the sector signal SECTOR being a HIGH state. Due to this, the potential of the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is maintained to be a LOW state. The third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is turned off by the potential of the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> being a LOW state. Meanwhile, as the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected through the first node Q<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the second NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, they are transited to a LOW state. The third PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is turned off by the potential of the second node Q<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being a LOW state. Therefore, the first supply power voltage VPPX is supplied to the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As the potential of the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is kept at a high voltage, the second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned off. The first supply power voltage VPPX supplied to the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by means of a gate pump is raised to a program voltage (about 9V). At the same time, the bit line selected by the program address is raised from a LOW state to a program voltage by means of the drain pump, so that the program operation for the selected cell A can proceed. At this time, the source lines in all the cells are maintained at a ground potential Vss since the sixth and seventh NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are turned on by the source control signal SOCTRL being a HIGH state. However, in the conventional flash memory device performing the above program operation, the drain voltage in the cell is increased to 5V being the program voltage, so that the threshold voltage for a not-selected cell is lowered by a coupling. Due to this, the leakage current of the not-selected cell is increased. Therefore, the program current for the selected cell requires about twice of a pure program current of a cell to significantly increase the size of the drain pump for supplying the current to the bit lines in the cell. Also, there is a problem that the drain voltage in an actually selected cell is significantly lowered to degrade the program speed of the cell since the bit line current of the selected cell is increased. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in detail by way of a preferred embodiment with reference to accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals are used to identify the same or similar parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram of a flash memory device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The flash memory device includes a NOR-type flash memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a decoder unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for controlling word lines of the memory cell, a source control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for controlling source lines of the memory cell, an internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for generating a given internal voltage, and a multiplexer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for controlling bit lines of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The decoder unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> consists of a plurality of decoding blocks <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>driven by a plurality of global word line signals GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through GWLn. Also, a single decoding block consists of a plurality of decoding circuit units <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>driven by local word line signals LWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through LWLm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A construction of the second decoder circuit unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> driven by the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be now explained as an example. A first PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> driven by the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is connected to the first node Q<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so that the voltage of the source terminal and the well can be raised by a boosting voltage. A first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> connected between the first node Q<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the ground terminal Vss is driven by the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. A first inverter <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> inverts the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. A second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected between an input terminal of the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is driven b the potential of the first node Q<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A second NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected between the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second power supply terminal VEEX is driven by the output signal of the first inverter <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. A third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected between the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second power supply terminal VEEX is driven by a second pre-decoder bar signal XPRE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. At this time, the second and third NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are each a triple well NMOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, a well bias SPWELL is applied to the wells of each of the flash memory cells constituting the flash memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The source control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is to apply an internal voltage of about 1V generated in the internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to a source of the not-selected cell. The source control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of source control signal generating circuits <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>. The source control signal generating circuits <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k </italic></highlight>may be formed in multiple depending on the number of a common source line of the flash memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A construction of the first source control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> will be now described as an example. A NAND gate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> logically combines a sector program signal SPGM and a first sector coding bar signal XPB<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A NOR gate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> logically combines an output signal of the NAND gate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a readout signal READ. The output signal of this NOR gate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> becomes a first source control signal SCRL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. Further, the fourth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected between the internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the first common source line SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. The fourth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> supplies an internal voltage generated in the internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the first common source line SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of the flash memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, depending on the first source control signal SCRL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> outputted from the first source control signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. A fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> driven by the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and a sixth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> driven by the readout signal READ are in parallel connected between the first common source line SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the ground terminal Vss to control the potential of the first common source line SOURCE<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A program method of the flash memory device according to the first embodiment of the present invention constructed as mentioned above will be now described by reference to the timing chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. For reference, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is the timing chart in case that the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> selected via the second decoding circuit unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is programmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order for the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be selected via the second decoding circuit unit <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and a cell thereto to be programmed, the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are selected depending on the program address signal and the sector program signal SPGM for the selected sector is also selected. In addition, a second pre-decoder bar signal XPREb for the selected second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is selected. In other words, in order for the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be selected via the second decoding block <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and a cell thereto to be programmed, the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are supplied with a high voltage of about 9V, and the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the sector program signal SPGM are inputted with a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The first PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned off by the first global word line GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> inputted with a HIGH state and the first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned on by the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> inputted with a HIGH state, so that the first node Q<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be maintained at a LOW state. Meanwhile, the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> inputted with a HIGH state is inverted into to a LOW state by the first inverter <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned on by the potential first node Q<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> being a LOW state. Further, the second NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is turned off by the output signal of the first inverter <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> being a LOW state. The third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is turned off by the second pre-decoder bar signal XPREb being a LOW state. Therefore, a high voltage of the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied to the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, a memory cell is selected B by a signal from the multiplexer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is then programmed. Also, the first NAND gate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> logically combines the program signal SPGM of a HIGH state and the first sector coding bar signal XPB<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a LOW state to produce a signal of a HIGH state. The first NOR gate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> logically combines the output signal of the first NAND gate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> being a HIGH state and the readout signal READ of a LOW state to output a first source control signal SCRL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of a LOW state. The fourth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is turned off by the first source control signal SCRL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of a LOW state. Therefore, as the internal voltage of about 1V generated in the internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is not inputted to the first source line S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, an internal voltage is not applied to the source of the programmed memory cell. In addition, the fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is turned on by the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of a HIGH state and the sixth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is turned off by the readout signal READ of a LOW state. Thus, the potential of the first source line SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is maintained at a ground potential Vss through the turned-on fifth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, an internal voltage of about 1V that is generated in the internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is applied to the source lines other than the first source line SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. A k source line SOk will be explained as an example. The sector program signal SPGM of a HIGH state and the first sector coding bar signal XPM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of a HIGH state are inputted to the first NAND gate (not shown), and the first NAND gate (not shown) logically combines those signals to output a signal of a LOW state. The output signal of the first NAND gate (not shown) being a LOW state and the readout signal READ being a LOW state are inputted into the first NOR gate (not shown), and the first NOR gate (not shown) logically combines those signals to output a k source control signal SCRLk of a HIGH state. A seventh NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is turned on by the k source control signal SCRLk of a HIGH state, so that an internal voltage of about 1V that is generated in the internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is applied to the first source line SOI. Meanwhile, as the n-th global word line signal GWLn is applied with a LOW state and the readout signal READ is applied with a LOW state, eighth and ninth NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As such, the threshold voltage of the cell can be increased by about 0.5V by applying the internal voltage of about 1V, that does not give a stress to the source terminal, to the source line of the not-selected memory cell. Therefore, reduction in the threshold voltage the not-selected cell by the drain coupling depending on the drain voltage supplied to the bit lines of the selected cell can be compensated for. </paragraph>

A first PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> driven by the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is connected to the first node Q<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> so that the voltage of the source terminal and the well can be raised by a boosting voltage. A first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> connected between the first node Q<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the ground terminal Vss is driven by the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. A first inverter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> inverts the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. A second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected between an input terminal of the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is driven b the potential of the first node Q<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>.

At this time, the second and third NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are each a triple well NMOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, a well bias SPWELL is applied to the wells of each of the flash memory cells constituting the flash memory cell array <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In addition, the source control unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, N<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for applying a voltage of about 1V that is generated in the internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to a plurality of the common source lines SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through SOm, respectively, depending on the sector program signal SPGM, a plurality of NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, N<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for controlling the potential of the word lines WL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through WLm depending on the potentials of the common source lines SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through SOm, respectively, and a plurality of NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, N<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for controlling the potentials of the common source lines SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through SOm depending on the potential of the word lines WL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through WLm, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A program method of the flash memory device according to the second embodiment of the present invention constructed as mentioned above will be now described by reference to the timing chart in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. For reference, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the timing chart in case that the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> selected via the second decoding circuit unit <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> is programmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order for the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be selected via the second decoding circuit unit <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> and a cell thereto to be programmed, the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are selected depending on the program address signal and the sector program signal SPGM for the selected sector is also selected. In addition, a second pre-decoder bar signal XPREb for the selected second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is selected. In other words, in order for the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be selected via the second decoding block <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> and a cell thereto to be programmed, the first global word line signal GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are supplied with a high voltage of about 9V, and the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and the sector program signal SPGM are inputted with a HIGH state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The first PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is turned off by the first global word line GWL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> inputted with a HIGH state and the first NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is turned on by the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> inputted with a HIGH state, so that the first node Q<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be maintained at a LOW state. Meanwhile, the first control signal NGW<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> inputted with a HIGH state is inverted into to a LOW state by the first inverter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The second PMOS transistor P<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned on by the potential first node Q<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> being a LOW state. Further, the second NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned off by the output signal of the first inverter <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> being a LOW state. The third NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is turned off by the second pre-decoder bar signal XPREb being a LOW state. Therefore, a high voltage of the second local word line signal LWL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied to the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, a memory cell is selected C by a signal from the multiplexer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and is then programmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In addition, fourth, seventh and tenth NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, N<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are turned on by the sector program signal SPGM of a HIGH state, so that an internal voltage generated in the internal voltage generator <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is applied to common source lines SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through SOm, respectively. However, a ninth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is turned on by the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of a HIGH state. Due to this, the internal voltage supplied to the second the common source line S<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight> is transferred to the ground terminal Vss, so that the second the common source line SO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is kept at a LOW state. Further, the eighth NMOS transistor N<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is turned off by the potential of the second common source line SO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being a LOW state. Therefore, the internal voltage is not applied to the source of the memory cell block in which the selected memory cell C is included. On the other hand, word lines other than the second word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is kept at a LOW state. By taking an the shown first and m-th word line WL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an example, they are maintained at a LOW state, so that the sixth and twelfth NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are turned off. Thereby, an internal voltage is applied to the first and m-th the common source lines SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and SOm. Also, the fifth and eleventh NMOS transistors N<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are turned on by the potential of the first and m-th the common source lines SO<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and SOm being a HIGH state, so that the potential of the first and mth word lines WL<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and WLm are reduced to the ground potential Vss. Therefore, an internal voltage is applied to the sources of the memory cell block other than the memory cell blocks in which the selected memory cell C is included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from the above description, according to the present invention, the threshold voltage of the not-selected cell can be increased, by applying the voltage of about 1V to the source of the not-selected cell during the time when the selected cell is programmed. Also, reduction in the threshold voltage of the not-selected cell by the drain coupling depending on the drain voltage supplied to the bit lines of the selected cell can be compensated for. Therefore, as the bit line current of the selected cell becomes almost same to the program current value of the selected cell, the size of the drain pump can be smaller than a conventional pump size. Thus, there is an outstand effect that the size of the chip can be reduced. Further, there is an effect that fall in the bit lines of the selected cell can be reduced to improve the program speed of the selected cell since the bit line current of the selected cell is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
