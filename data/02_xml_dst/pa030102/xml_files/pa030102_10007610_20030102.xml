<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A glove for wearing on a user&apos;s hand to grip an object, such as a barbell. The glove has a palm side which carries a plurality of pads that have gripping surfaces. The pads are positioned in spaced-apart relationship and connected together by a flexible connecting layer. The connecting layer is sufficiently thinner than the pads to allow the glove and user&apos;s hand to be comfortably curled about and uncurled from a object while enabling a secure grip. Valleys between the pads serve to recess the connecting layer below the gripping surfaces. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to gloves for use in sports and other activities in which a person grips an object, and more particularly to gloves for enabling a person to grip and securly hold an object such as a weighlifting barbell, oar or paddle for a boat, baseball bat, skateboard, golf club, javelin, trapeze or gymnastic bar and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, people involved in activities where grip on an object is important, such as weightlifting, baseball, golf, skateboarding, paddling, gymnastics and the like, use gloves to protect their hands and improve traction with the object. Certain types of these prior gloves have palm portions which are designed to improve the grip and prevent slippage. Gloves with palm portions which are padded have been provided, but the padding can make it difficult for the person to easily and comfortably close and maintain a firm grip about the object. In prior gloves which have sufficient padding for protecting the user&apos;s hands, the palm portion tends to bunch up as the hands curl about the object. This undesirably reduces the amount of traction between the glove and object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The need has therefore been recognized for a glove for use in gripping objects such as barbells which obviates the foregoing and other limitations and disadvantages of prior art gloves. Despite the various gloves in the prior art, there has heretofore not been provided a suitable and attractive solution to these problems.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in the drawing shows generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a sports glove in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention. Glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is comprised of a glove body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a palm side comprising a palm portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which includes finger stall portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and thumb stall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The glove further comprises a back side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>). As desired, an elongated strap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (only the proximal end is shown) could be attached at its proximal end to the glove body with suitable releasable attachment means (for example, Velcro&reg; fasteners) on the strap&apos;s distal end. In use for sports such as weightlifting or skateboarding, strap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> would be tightly wrapped around the athlete&apos;s wrist to protect against hyperflexion of the wrist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Glove body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a connecting layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> integral with a plurality of gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, an intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and an optional inner lining <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is comprised of a suitable strong and flexible material such as leather. This layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has an inside <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which faces the hand when the glove is worn, and an outside <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which faces away from the hand. Inner lining <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is comprised of a thin fabric material, such as polyester, which is secured as by sewing or laminating to the inside of layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This inner lining is in contact with the user&apos;s hand. It provides comfort for the hand and also serves to wick any moisture away from the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Finger stall portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises four stalls: an index finger stall <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, middle finger stall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, ring finger stall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and little finger stall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are carried on palm portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, including the finger and thumb stalls, on their sides facing away from back side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The pads are raised above the connecting layer and are formed with substantially flat lands <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which provide traction or gripping surfaces. In the drawing figures, the pads on the palm portion are labelled <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>those on the finger stalls are labelled <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>and those on the thumb stall are labelled <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The pads and connecting layer preferably are integrally formed of the same material. To this end, the connecting layer including the pads can be molded together from a suitable elastomer, such as rubber, which is flexible while providing optimum traction contact with the object being gripped. The connecting layer has a thickness which is sufficiently thinner than the pad thicknesses to enable the pads to bend toward and away from one another as the user curls and uncurls, respectively, the glove. For this purpose, a pad thickness in the range of 2 mm to 5 mm and a connecting layer thickness in the range of 0.8 mm to 2 mm can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and connecting layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be molded by suitable processes such as injection or compression molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The palm portion as well as the finger and thumb stalls further comprise a stitching layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is formed with openings or windows <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through which the gripping pads project. Layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is also shaped to repose in valleys <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which are formed between lands <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the gripping pads, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.. Individual ones of the openings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are commensurate in size and shape with the respective pads which they surround. Windows <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can advantageously be formed by die cutting. Stitching layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed of a suitable flexible material, such as leather, which is sufficiently strong to receive and hold stitches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> enables the stitches to penetrate through the connecting layer and into intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to securely anchor these components together. This construction also enables sewing below the pad surfaces so that the stitches are protected from objectionable abrasion, such as knurling on the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For purposes of clarity in the explanation, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> portions of intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, inner inner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, pad <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and stitching layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are show partially cut-away and peeled back from the glove body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in combination with connecting layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provide a &ldquo;living hinge&rdquo; action. This action is a result of the flexibility of the connecting layer together with the spacing provided by lands <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the relative size, shape and positioning of the pads. The living hinge enables the pads to lie spaced-apart when the glove is uncurled as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, and then to pivot together in the manner of a hinge as the glove is curled to the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are sized, shaped and positioned such that each pad essentially is an extension of the part of the human hand which it overlies. Thus, the pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in the glove palm portion are sized and shaped substantially commensurate with the corresponding fleshier parts of the human palm. The sizing, shaping and positioning also are such that the lands between the pads run along and essentially conform with and mimic the creases of the human palm (which act as hinges for portions of the human palm). The pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>on the finger stalls and the lands which separate them, as well as the pads and lands for the thumb stall, are also sized, shaped and positioned substantially commensurate with the corresponding portions of the human fingers and thumb. As a result, when the glove palm is curled or uncurled then each of the pads, enabled by the glove&apos;s living hinge action, pivot with the underlying curling or uncurling portion of the person&apos;s hand, fingers and thumb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When a person wearing one or a pair of the sports glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> flexes his or her hands or grips an object, the living hinge action enables the pads to form a relatively large traction area with an almost continuous gripping surface around the object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> as a barbell. This enhances the gripping effect between the glove and object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention provides a glove similar to the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and in which the palm and finger/thumb stalls are pre-curved. The glove can be pre-curved by making the connecting layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the glove&apos;s back side longer than intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the palm side, and then attaching suitable gussets (not shown) which are positioned to urge the glove into a cylindrically curved shape for gripping an object. The gussets could be comprised of pieces of triangular-shaped fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> provides a glove body similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> but with a more flexible connecting layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which is integral with and holding pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> apart. Layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is supported on an intermediate layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and optional inner layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Connecting layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is made with a thickness thinner than 0.8 mm to provide greater flexibility for enabling the curling action. The connecting layer and pads are strengthened by laminating or embedding or otherwise substantally integrating a suitable scrim or mesh fabric <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> into the elastomer which forms the connecting layer and pads during the molding process. </paragraph>
