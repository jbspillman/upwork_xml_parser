<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An optical recording medium has a user data area and a lead-out area, wherein the user data area and the lead-out area each has grooves and lands formed thereon. Wobbles are formed on at least one lateral surface of grooves of the user data area and the lead-out area, and configured such that wobble characteristics are made different between the user data area and the lead-out area. Different types of wobbles are formed on the grooves of either the user data area or the lead-out area, thereby preventing an optical pickup that performs recording/reproduction from deviating from the user data area. Also, in a multi-layer optical recording medium, a whole area of a recording layer is configured to have a same condition, thereby preventing deterioration in reproduction and/or recording due to a difference in light power transmittance of another recording layer. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical recording medium, and more particularly, to an optical recording medium having wobbles formed on at least one lateral surface of grooves of a user data area and grooves of a lead-out area, and configured such that wobble characteristics are made different between the user data area and the lead-out area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, optical recording media are widely employed as information recording media for an optical pickup device for recording/reproducing information. The optical recording media are classified into read-only-memory (ROM) compact discs (CDs) and digital versatile discs (DVDs) according to information recording capacity. Further, a DVD disc capable of writing, erasing and reading information can be sub-divided into a digital versatile disc-random access memory (DVD-RAM) disc and a digital versatile disc-rewritable (DVD-RW) disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In such a DVD-RAM or DVD-RW disc, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is a lead-in area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which read only data, such as disc size, number of track layers on a readable plane or illegal copy preventing information, is recorded, a user data area <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in which user data can be repeatedly read and/or written, and a lead-out area <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in which other disc-related information is recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As indicated by a portion &ldquo;C&rdquo; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there are grooves <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and lands <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> alternatively formed in the user data area <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so as to perform recording and/or reproducing information marks <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> along a predetermined track. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> denotes a reproduction beam. From enlarged portions of the lead-in area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;A&rdquo;) and the lead-out area <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;B&rdquo;), it is confirmed that physical pits <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which is read only data, are formed thereon. Here, the lead-out area <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> performs various functions. For example, the lead-out area <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> guards an optical pickup so as not to deviate from a user data area while the optical pickup performs recording/reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In particular, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in a dual-layer optical recording medium having a first recording layer L0 and a second recording layer L1 of opposite track paths, the lead-out area <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> allows an optical pickup to keep performing tracking during interlayer jumping from the outermost circumference of the first layer L0 to the outermost circumference of the second layer L1 without deviating from the track paths. The opposite tracks are sequentially addressed from the inner circumference of the first recording layer L0 to the outer circumference thereof, and then from the outer circumference of the second recording layer L1 to the inner circumference thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a dual-layer ROM disc, an area serving as a lead-out area varies according to the reproduction method of a second layer. In case of a dual-layer ROM disc having opposite track paths, a middle area is separately provided at each of the outer circumferences of the first and second recording layers. However, in case of a rewritable optical recording medium, both pits and grooves can be used Therefore, in case of dual layer rewritable optical recording media, recording power is affected by the physical geometry of the first recording layer L0 during recording of data. In other words, when recording is performed on the second recording layer L1, a recording light beam passes through the first recording layer L0, resulting in a difference in the transmittance between pit portions and groove portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Light power was measured for an optical recording medium at a mirror area, a pit area, a groove area and a groove area with marks, for simulation of the light power depending on a difference in the transmittance according to various conditions of the first recording layer L0, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</cross-reference>. Here, the number of tracks trapped by laser beam transmitted through a lens was taken into consideration. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graph showing the measurement result of light power depending on the transmittance for the cases shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, according to the simulation result, a decrease in the light power is smallest in the mirror portion (graph line with solid squares), and the light power gradually decreases more in the order of a pit portion (graph line with solid diamonds), a groove portion (graph line with solid triangles block) and a groove mark portion (graph line with solid circles). Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in the case of a dual layer disc, the transmittance varies according to the physical geometry of the first recording layer L0, which in case of a rewritable optical recording medium can further affect the recording power during recording of data. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical recording medium having a lead-out area configured to prevent a pickup from deviating from a user data area during recording and/or reproduction of data, without affecting the recording power. The present invention can be applied to optical recording media, which include optical rewritable recording media. In particular, in case of multi-layer optical recording media the present invention unifies the physical geometry of a recording layer as well as provides a discriminating lead-out area. For example, in a dual layer rewritable optical recording media, the present invention unifies the physical geometry of a first recording layer L0 of the dual layer disc (i.e., wobbles formed on at least one lateral surface of each groove provide a uniform transmittance of an optical light beam passing through a recording layer) as well as newly defines a lead-out area or a middle area to perform a guard function. A middle area means each outer circumference of the first and second recording layers in opposite tracks. That is, the opposite tracks are sequentially addressed from the inner circumference of the first recording layer L0 to the outer circumference thereof, and then from the outer circumference of the second recording layer L1 to the inner circumference thereof. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Further, in case of multi-layer recording media, the two or more recording layers have different synchronization patterns in their lead-out areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case of multi-layer recording media, the lead-out area has a width of two or more times the maximum allowance of disc eccentricity.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, example embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings where like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures and to more completely explain the present invention to anyone skilled in the art. The present invention is not restricted to the following embodiments, and many variations are possible within the spirit and scope of the present invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an optical recording medium according to the present invention includes a lead-in area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, each area having grooves <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and lands <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> formed thereon. Wobbles <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are formed on at least one lateral surface of each of grooves <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and lands <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Here, a portion &ldquo;E&rdquo; of the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a portion &ldquo;D&rdquo; of the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are enlarged and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> denotes a laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As described above, the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a guard function that prevents an optical pickup (not shown) from deviating from the user data area during recording and/or reproduction of data, and in case of a dual-layer disc the lead-out area can keep/maintain tracking while interlayer jumping from the outermost circumference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an optical recording medium according to a first embodiment of the present invention, to provide the guard function, wobbles different from the wobbles <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are formed in an area beyond a predetermined radius of the optical recording medium (i.e., a lead-out area). In other words, at least one kind of features including periods, frequencies, amplitudes and phases of the wobbles <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are modulated in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The wobbles may include addressing information or reference time information in the form of phase locked loop (PLL). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For example, the wobbles of the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be formed by modulating at least one feature of frequency, period, amplitude and phase of the wobbles of the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as follows. In case of modulating the frequencies of the wobbles <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, the wobble <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be formed to have a frequency of n times (n is a real number) the basic frequency of the wobble <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The differing wobbles of the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the lead out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> unify the physical geometry of the optical recording medium as well as provide a discriminating lead-out area as a guard. In other words, the wobbles formed on at least one lateral surface of each groove according to the present invention provide a uniform transmittance of an optical light beam passing through a recording layer. For example, to unify the physical geometry of the disc and to serve as a guard, the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be configured such that the wobble <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> has a frequency of 2 times that of the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Further, in case of modulating the wobble period T, the wobble <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the wobble <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can, for example, have periods 200T and 100T, respectively, so that the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be discriminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Further, after completion of manufacture of the disc, 00h as pattern data may be recorded in the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the 00h pattern data is read out by a channel 1 (Ch1) during recording/reproduction, and the wobble frequency and/or period can be read out by a channel 2 (Ch2), thereby allowing double discrimination of the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In an optical medium according to a second embodiment of the present invention, when formatting the optical medium, a predetermined recording pattern can be recorded in the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, thereby discriminating the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The predetermined recording pattern may be, for example, a recording pattern used in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. That is to say, among recording patterns used in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a predetermined recording pattern, for example, a 00h pattern, can be repeatedly recorded in the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, thereby recognizing the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the recording pattern not used in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is recorded in the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, thereby recognizing the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. For example, a 00h pattern is recorded in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and an FFh pattern as another pattern is recorded in the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in this case, the recording patterns recorded on the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are different from those used in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Here, the 00h and FFh patterns are recording patterns based on the hexadecimal system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> According to a third embodiment of the present invention, the optical medium includes a user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, each having grooves <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and lands <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Different types of synchronization patterns (to be abbreviated as &ldquo;sync patterns&rdquo; hereinafter) are used in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Thus, the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is discriminated by recognizing the sync patterns, thereby preventing an optical pickup from deviating from the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> during recording/reproduction. The sync patterns are recorded on the grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As described above, in an optical recording medium, different types of wobbles are formed on the grooves of the user data area or the lead-out area, thereby preventing an optical pickup that performs recording/reproduction from deviating from the user data area. Further, in an optical recording medium predetermined recording patterns and/or different synchronization patterns can be recorded on the lead-out area and the user data area alone or in addition to the different type wobbles to provide a guard function preventing deviation of the pickup from the user data area. The recording and synchronization patterns in addition to the wobbles can allow double discrimination of the lead-out area. Thus, in the present invention, an optical pickup can be prevented from deviating from the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by discriminating between the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The present invention can accommodate a multi-layer optical recording medium having two or more recording layers as follows. The multi-layer optical recording medium includes a user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, each having grooves <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and lands <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Wobbles <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are formed on at least one lateral surface of each of the grooves <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and the lands <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. The wobbles <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> may include addressing information or reference time information, e.g., phase locked loop (PLL). To prevent an optical pickup from deviating from the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the wobbles <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> formed in the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, respectively, may be modulated into different types of wobbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Further, in a multi-layer optical recording medium having two or more recording layers, different recording patterns are formed on each lead-out area of the respective recording layers, thereby discriminating the respective recording layers. For example, in the case of a dual-layer recording medium, a 00h pattern may be recorded on the lead-out area of the first recording layer and an FFh pattern may be recorded on the lead-out area of the second recording layer. By doing so, the recording patterns are read out by a channel 1 (Ch1) and wobble signals based on wobble modulation are read out by a channel 2 (Ch2), during recording and/or reproducing on/from the optical recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Further, to maintain tracking during interlayer jumping, the width of the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be determined to be twice or more times the maximum allowance of disc eccentricity. If disc eccentricity according to injection in the course of manufacture of a disc is approximately 50 &mgr;m, the width of the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is determined to be 100 &mgr;m or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the present invention, to discriminate the respective recording layers in a multi-layer optical recording medium having two or more recording layers, different sync patterns may be used for each recording layer in the lead-out area <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, grooves are formed on a user data area and a lead-out area, and different types of wobbles are formed on the grooves of either the user data area or the lead-out area, thereby configuring a recording layer of a multi-layer recording medium to have a same condition and providing a discriminating lead-out area. The discriminating lead-out area prevents an optical pickup that performs recording/reproduction from deviating from the user data area. Also, the configuration of the whole area of a recording layer to have the same condition, prevents deterioration in reproduction and/or recording due to a difference in light power transmittance of another higher (upper) recording layer. For example, in a dual layer optical recording medium, the whole area of a first recording layer is configured to have a same condition to prevent deterioration in reproduction and/or recording, which requires light power adjustment, on a second layer due to a difference in a transmittance of the first recording layer. Therefore, in case of a multi-layer rewritable optical recording medium according to the present invention, recording can be performed on the grooves <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> or on both the grooves <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and the lands <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and the optical pickup can maintain a uniform light power during reproduction and/or recording on respective recording layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> By using such wobbles according to the present invention, a whole area of a recording layer can be configured to have a same condition, preventing deterioration in reproduction and/or recording due to a difference in the transmittance of a recording layer. Although the whole area of the recording layer is configured to have the same condition, in the present invention, an optical pickup can be prevented from deviating from the user data area <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the respective recording layers can be discriminated by using the wobbles according to the present invention and/or the above described recording and synchronization patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to example embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
