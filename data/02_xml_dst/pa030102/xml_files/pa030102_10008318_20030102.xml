<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a lockable box for pre-recorded media, notably a DVD box. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Pre-recorded storage media such as digital versatile discs (DVDs) are usually put up for sale in a plastic box which carries information about the DVD as well as carrying sales promotional material or artwork to attract a purchaser. To prevent theft of the DVD from a store various lockable display containers have been proposed which house the DVD in its box and prevent a thief gaining access to the DVD without breaking the container or removing the container from the shop. The container can be fitted with alarm means so that it cannot be removed from the shop without actuating an alarm. Examples of such lockable containers are described in EP 0 312 172, EP 0 541 733, EP 0 666 954 and WO 00/61899. These display containers are effective but they increase the bulk of the product on display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Known products provide a locking member which is externally applied to the box, With such products, the box cannot be shrink-wrapped for &ldquo;sell-through&rdquo;, as there is then no means of removing the locking member without damaging the packaging. The locking members are also subject to being tampered with. Once the locking member has been removed in order to unlock the box (in a rental situation) it has to be safely stored for re-use later on. If the locking member is lost, the box can no longer be secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to provide an improved lockable disc box. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a lockable box for a DVD or other pre-recorded data carrier. The box has at least two releasably interengageable locking members which, when interengaged, prevent the box from being opened. The locking members are entirely contained within the box when the box is closed, and they can be disengaged only with the use of a special tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the box is a DVD box, and the invention will be described with reference to this embodiment. However, it will be understood that the invention is also applicable to other pre-recorded data carriers, for example compact discs (CDs), videos and tape cassettes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The DVD box may be supplied to Record Label and Film Studio Companies as original packaging, filled with product and then sent to a retailer in either a locked or an unlocked state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Unlike existing products, which require a manual action to insert (lock) or remove (unlock) the locking member, the disc box of the present invention can be locked and unlocked in a hands-free manner. By incorporating a ferrous element in a movable locking member, the box may be locked and unlocked by swiping it against a suitable strong magnet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The box comprises a first box member and a second box member which are adjustable between a closed position in which they co-operate to define a substantially closed box, and an open position in which the inside of the box is accessible to permit a disc to be inserted into or removed from the box. Each box member has a locking member, and at least one of the locking members is adjustable between a locked position in which, when the box members are in the closed position, the locking members interengage so as to prevent the box from being opened, and an unlocked position in which the locking members permit the box members to be moved from the closed position to the open position. The two co-operating locking members comprise a locking mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The locking member on each box member could be movable relative to the box member. However it is preferred that one locking member is movable and the other is fixed relative to its box member. In a preferred embodiment, the movable locking member is pivotable between the locked and unlocked positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One of the locking members may be provided with a hole or recess in which the other locking member is disposed when the box is locked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the movable locking member is slidable between the locked and unlocked positions. By providing each end of the slidable locking member with a ferrous element, locking and unlocking may be carried out means of a single swipe along an appropriate edge of the box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Although the invention may employ only one locking mechanism, it is preferred that more than one locking mechanism, preferably two locking mechanisms, are provided. This preferred embodiment permits all three free edges of a conventional hinged DVD box to be locked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment where one locking member of a pair is fixed and the other is movable, both movable locking members may conveniently be provided on the same box member. However, it would also be possible to provide one movable locking member on each box member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The interior of the box may be provided with an electronic tag of a type known per se which activates an alarm system if an attempt is made to remove the DVD box from the store. It is particularly preferred that the tag may be remotely deactivated by electronic means. This permits the DVD box to be sold in shrink wrapping and to be both unlocked and alarm-deactivated at the point of sale without removing the wrapping. Suitable electronic tags are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Other aspects and benefits of the invention will appear in the following specification, drawings and claims. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The DVD box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises a first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a second box member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, of substantially similar dimensions, connected together by a hinge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The box members <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are hollow shells, for example of polypropylene, which co-operate to form a closed box when pivoted about the hinge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in known manner. The first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with an annular disc-receiving member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with a resilient mount <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the middle, for releasably securing a DVD (not shown) as is well known in the art. The disc-receiving member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and mount <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> could additionally or alternatively be provided on the second box member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, or on an intermediate mounting member between the box members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Two locking members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are pivotally mounted on the inner surface of the first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by means of pivot pins <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The friction between the pivot pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and its locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is such that the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> cannot be pivoted by shaking of the box; a greater force is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Upstanding lugs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are provided on the inner surface of the first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> adjacent the distal ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and proximal ends <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the pivotable locking members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The second box member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided with locking members comprising upstanding lugs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the inner surface. Each upstanding lug <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a hole, and when the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is closed pairs of lugs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are located face to face with the holes in alignment. The arrangement is such that, with the box members <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the closed position, pivoting of the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the unlocked position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to the locked position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> brings the ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into disposition through the holes in both the aligned lugs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the pair. In this position, the box members <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are locked together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> closed, the locking members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are pivotable only with the use of a special tool. It is preferred that the proximal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and distal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> ends of the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are formed from a ferrous material or are provided with a ferrous insert or attachment. This permits the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be pivoted by means of a strong external magnet device. A suitable magnetic device is described in WO 00/61899. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To lock the box, the box is closed, and then each short edge <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is swiped in turn against the magnet. The magnet attracts the ferrous insert of the distal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, causing the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to pivot and both ends to engage in holes in the associated pair of lugs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To unlock the box, the long edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is swiped against the magnet so that the magnet attracts the distal ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the locking members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and reverses the locking process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In practice, the magnet may be mounted on a checkout desk at the point of sale or rental. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Although the above arrangement is preferred for ease of unlocking, it will be appreciated that the opposite arrangement could also be used, whereby locking is achieved by a single swipe along the long edge of the box, and unlocking by a swipe along both short edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be accessible via a hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in an edge of the box. As illustrated in the drawings, the box could be locked by a user inserting a long thin tool through the hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the long edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so as to push the proximal end <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and cause the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to pivot to the locked position. It would be possible for unlocking to be carried out by the same tool through a similar hole adjacent to the distal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However it is preferred that exclusively magnetic means are used for unlocking and, preferably, for locking, the box because the use of a suitable magnet is quicker and permits the DVD box to be locked and unlocked while shrouded in shrink-wrap material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the proximal ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are provided with permanent magnets with like poles facing towards the long edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This permits the box to be locked with a single swipe of a suitable magnet with a like pole adjacent the long edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that the permanent magnets in the proximal ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are repelled. The box can be unlocked with a single swipe of a suitable magnet with the opposite polarity adjacent the long edge. Both types of magnets could be mounted at the point of sale or rental, one for locking and the other for unlocking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It would be possible not to provide the lugs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> engages only with the lugs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the second box member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> when the box is locked. However, this would require the locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be relatively rugged and robust because it would need to resist upward force exerted by an attempt to prise the box members apart. In the preferred embodiment the ends of the locking members are disposed through lugs on both the first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the second box member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, so that the lugs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> prevent force from the second box member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being transmitted to the pivot pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The entire locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its mount may be provided as a removable insert to enable its removal either at point of sale or by a customer. Alternatively, the pivot pin <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could be made releasable by exerting an upward force on the pivotable locking member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of the invention employs a locking member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which is slidably mounted on the first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The second box member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of fixed locking members comprising upstanding L-shaped hooks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For each hook <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> there is a corresponding hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the slidable locking member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Under each hole <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> there is a space <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, for receiving a corresponding hook <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The proximal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and distal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> ends of both slidable locking members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are provided with ferrous inserts (not shown) so that they are attractable by a magnet. By swiping a first long edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the box against a suitable magnet, the slidable locking member moves in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to an unlocked position in which the hooks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can enter and leave the spaces <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via the holes <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. With the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the closed position and the slidable locking member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the unlocked position, the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be locked by swiping the opposite long edge <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> against a magnet so as to move the slidable locking member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the locked position in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Here, the hooks <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are trapped in the slidable locking member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the box is locked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the DVD box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be locked and unlocked with a single swipe against a suitable magnet along the appropriate edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment of the invention including a sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> mounted in the first box member as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. The sliding locking member is disposed between retaining pillars <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that retain the slidable locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in the correct alignment. A wall <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> separates the sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from the disc-receiving member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown in the locked position for illustrative purposes, although the second box member is not in the closed position. The sliding locking member is provided with holes <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> through which hooks <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> formed on the second box member <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may pass. The first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes receptacles <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> aligned through the holes <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> for receiving the hooks <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The arrangement of the hooks <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the receptacles <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is more clearly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. A receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> also includes a resiliently biased detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that co-operates with a pillar <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> on the first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to prevent the sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from moving easily to the unlocked position. This prevents the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from being unlocked by tapping or knocking. The resiliently biased detent is shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The sliding locking member also includes ferrous inserts <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on opposite long edges of the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to enable magnetic locking and unlocking of the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an elevation view of the resiliently biased detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> comprises an elongate body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with an enlarged circular head <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A pillar <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> on the first box member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> protrudes upwardly adjacent to the detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In the locked position (as shown) the pillar <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is located in a recess <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> between the body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and head <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> To unlock the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> the sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> must be moved in the direction shown by arrow <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> causing the head <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by the pillar <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The body of the detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is resiliently deformable such that the head <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may move slightly from side to side in the plane of the sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. For the head <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to pass by the pillar <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> the body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the detent <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> must deform to allow the head <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to move aside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The force required for such a deformation prevents the sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> from moving to an unlocked position when the box <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is shaken, tapped or hit sharply. The force required should be such that the sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be moved when desired by unlocking means such as a magnet as discussed above. The force required can be adjusted as needed by changing the dimensions of the body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or head <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the detent or by altering the material from which it is made during manufacture. Additionally, or alternatively, the pillar <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> could be made releasably moveable so that its position can be laterally adjusted to increase or decrease the force needed for the head <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the detent <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to pass by. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 11</cross-reference> show an elevation view of a receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>.

The receptacle <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> passes through a hole <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> in the sliding locking member <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. When the sliding locking member is in the locked position (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) it engages in cutout portions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the two side walls <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. When the sliding locking member is in the unlocked position (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) it allows a hook <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to enter the receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and pass through the hole <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
