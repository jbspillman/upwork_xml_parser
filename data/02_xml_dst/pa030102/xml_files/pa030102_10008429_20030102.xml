<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to the field of television systems, and more particularly, to interactive television. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With the recent advent of digital transmission technology, subscriber television systems are now capable of providing many other services in addition to traditional analog broadcast video. For example, two-way and advanced one-way communications between a subscriber and a subscriber network system headend are now possible. The home communication terminal (&ldquo;HCT&rdquo;), including digital HCTs (or DHCTs), also known as the set-top box, has become an important computing device for accessing video services and navigating a subscriber through a maze of services available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are other electronic communications systems that have been used for purchasable recordable media (PRM) content. For example, one may be able to purchase an audio product on the Internet and then download it to a personal computer for future use. The application of electronic communications systems for the sale and delivery of applicable products can offer advantages over more conventional product sales and delivery systems such as phone ordering with parcel delivery. For example, advantages may be offered such as the lower cost of product delivery or the savings of not requiring inventory, floor space, and retail employees. But, the present electronic communications sales and delivery systems are often subject to &ldquo;bottlenecks&rdquo; that may result in undelivered media content as requested by a purchaser. Thus, there is a need for dependable delivery of products by way of an electronic communications system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and example embodiments and should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those having ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, all example embodiments given herein are intended to be non-limiting and among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One preferred embodiment of the present invention is generally implemented as part of a subscriber television system (STS), such as for example, a digital broadband delivery system (DBDS) or a cable television system (CTS). Hence, an illustrative STS and its operation will be described initially. Other conventional data delivery systems are also included within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram view of a STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is generally a high quality, reliable and integrated network system that is preferably capable of delivering video, audio, voice and data services to client devices, such as a digital home communication terminal devices (DHCTs) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a high level view of a STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it should be appreciated that a plurality of STSs can tie together a plurality of regional networks into an integrated global network so that DHCT users can receive media content provided from anywhere in the world. Further, it will be appreciated that the STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. For instance, subscriber television systems also included within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention include systems not utilizing physical structured cabling for transmission, such as, but not limited to, satellite systems. Further, transmission media included within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, hybrid fiber/coax (HFC), optical, satellite, radio frequency (RF), frequency modulated (FM), and microwave. Further, data provided from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and programming necessary to perform the functions discussed below will be understood to be present in the STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the description below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably delivers broadcast video signals as digitally formatted signals in addition to delivering traditional broadcast analog video signals. Furthermore, the system can preferably support one way broadcast services as well as both one-way data services and two-way media content and data services. The two-way operation of the network preferably allows for user interactivity with services, such as Pay-Per-View programming, Near Video-On-Demand (NVOD) programming according to any of several known NVOD implementation methods, Video-on-Demand (VOD) programming (according to any of several VOD implementation methods), and interactive applications, such as Internet connections and purchasable recordable media (PRM) content services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also provides the interfaces, network control, transport control, session control, and servers to access media content from media services, and distributes media content to DHCT users. Note that the terms media content and PRM content will be understood to mean the content stored and delivered throughout the STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as movies, software, music, etc. When it is helpful to discuss each individual movie or program, etc. (i.e. media content in the singular), the term media content instance or PRM content instance or the like will be used. The title of that media content instance, or PRM content instance, will be referred to as a media content title, or PRM content title. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> typical STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, hubs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that although a single component (e.g. a headend) is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can feature a plurality of any one of the illustrated components or may be configured with alternative embodiments for any one of the individual components or with yet other additional components not enumerated above. Media content provided by one or more content providers, such as content provider <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, is communicated by the content providers to one or more headends <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. From those headends <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> the content is then communicated over a communications network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that includes a plurality of HFC access networks <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (only one HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is illustrated). The HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a plurality of HFC nodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, each of which may serve a local geographical area. The hub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connects to the HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through a fiber portion of the HFC access network <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to a tap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which, in one implementation, is connected to a digital home communication terminal (DHCT) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In other implementations, the tap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to a network interface unit (NIU) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is connected to a digital home communication terminal (DHCT) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The NIU <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is normally located at the property of a user and provides a transparent interface between the HFC node <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the users&apos; internal wiring. Coaxial cables are typically used to couple nodes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, taps <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and NIUs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> because the electrical signals can be easily repeated with RF amplifiers. As the high-level operations of many of the functions of a STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, further high level description of the overall STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will not be contained herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows one implementation of transmission channels supported by the STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as delivered by the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and received as input channels by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although one DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and one headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are illustrated, it is understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that more than one of each may be included in a subscriber television system. The STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) can simultaneously support a number of transmission signal types, transmission rates and modulation formats. The ability to carry analog and digital signals over a large bandwidth are characteristics of a hybrid fiber/coax (HFC) network typically employed in a subscriber television system. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, analog and digital signals in HFC networks can be multiplexed using, in one implementation, frequency division multiplexing (FDM), which enables many different types of signals to be transmitted over the subscriber television system to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In one typical implementation, a subscriber television system using HFC supports downstream (i.e. in the direction from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) frequencies from 50 MHz to 870 MHz, whereas upstream frequencies (i.e. in the direction from the DHCT to higher levels of the system) are in the 5 MHz to 42 MHz band. Generally, the RF bandwidth spacing for analog and digital services is 6 MHz. Furthermore, for a typical 870 MHz system in the U.S., a possible downstream RF spectrum subdivision plan uses 6 MHz frequency subdivisions, or spans within the 50 MHz to 550 MHz band for analog video transmission signals and within the 550 MHz to 870 MHz range for digital transmission signals. The Analog Transmission Signals (ATSs) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are typically broadcast in 6 MHz frequency subdivisions, typically referred to in analog broadcasting as channels, having an analog broadcast signal composed of analog video and analog audio, and include Broadcast TV Systems Committee (BTSC) stereo and Secondary Audio Program (SAP) audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the downstream direction transmission signals, having been multiplexed preferably using frequency division multiplexing (FDM), and often referred to as in-band transmission signals, include Analog Transmission Signals (ATSs) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and Digital Transmission Signals (DTSs) <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. These transmission signals carry video, audio, and data services. For example, these transmission signals can carry television signals, Internet data, or any additional types of data, such as Interactive Program Guide (IPG) data. Additionally, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, additional data can be sent with the analog video image in the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) of the video signal and stored in DHCT memory or a DHCT local physical storage device (not shown). It should be appreciated, however, that the amount of data that can be transmitted in the VBI of the analog video signal is typically significantly less than data transmitted in DTSs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Like the ATSs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the DTSs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> each occupies 6 MHz of the RF spectrum. However, the DTSs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are preferably digital transmission signals consisting of 64- or 256-Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) digital signals formatted as MPEG-2 transport streams, allocated in a separate frequency range. The MPEG-2 transport stream enables transmission of a plurality of DTS types over each 6 MHz RF subdivision, as compared to a 6 MHz ATS <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Three types of digital transport signals <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> include broadcast digital transmission signals <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, carousel digital transmission signals <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and on-demand transmission signals <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. MPEG-2 transport may be used to multiplex video, audio, and data in each of these digital transmission signals (DTSs) <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. However, because MPEG-2 transport streams multiplex video, audio, and data to be placed in the same stream, the DTSs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> do not necessarily have to be allocated in separate 6 MHz RF frequencies, unlike the ATSs <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Continuing with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the broadcast DTSs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and carousel DTSs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> preferably function as continuous feeds for indefinite time, whereas the on-demand DTSs <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are continuous feed sessions for a limited time. Preferably, all DTSs <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are capable of being transmitted at high data rates. The broadcast DTSs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> preferably carry data comprising multiple digitally compressed and formatted as MPEG-2, TV source signals and other continuously fed data information. The carousel DTSs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> carry broadcast data, such as IPG data and data for a catalog of recordable media content, that is systematically broadcast in a cycling fashion but updated and revised as need be. Thus, the carousel DTSs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can serve to carry high volume data, such as IPG data and purchasable recordable media (PRM) catalog data, as well as other data at high data rates. The carousel DTSs <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> preferably carry data formatted in directories and files by a Broadcast File System (BFS) (not shown), which is used for producing and transmitting data streams throughout the subscriber television system, and which provides an efficient method for delivery of application executables and application data to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The on-demand DTSs <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> can carry particular information, such as compressed video and audio pertaining to subscriber requested video services or recordable media content, as well as other specialized data information. Each carousel DTS <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and on-demand DTS <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is defined by a session managed by a session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, via an MPEG-2 Digital Storage Media-Command and Control (DSM-CC) protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are Out-Of-Band (OOB) signals <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> that provides a continuously available two-way signaling path to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> regardless of which in-band signals are tuned to by an individual DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in-band tuner. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may also comprise multiple in-band tuners in which case the OOB signals <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> complements the service of the set of in-band tuners. The OOB signals <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> consists of a forward data signal (FDS) and a reverse data signal (RDS). The OOB signals <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> can comply to any one of a number of well known transport protocols but preferably complies to either a DAVIC 1.1 Transport Protocol with FDS of 1.544 mega bits per second (MBps) or more using Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation and an RDS of 1.544 Mbps or more using QPSK modulation, or to a DOCSIS Transport Protocol with FDS of 27 Mbps using 64-QAM modulation and a RDS of 1.544 Mbps or more using QPSK modulation or 16-QAM modulation. The OOB signals <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> provides the two-way operation of the network, which allows for subscriber interactivity with the services provided by the network. Therefore, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably contains functionality somewhat similar to a networked computer (i.e., a computer without a persistent storage device) in addition to traditional set top box functionality, as is well known in the art. Furthermore, the OOB signals <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> are not limited to a 6 MHz spectrum, but generally to a smaller spectrum, such as 1.5 or 3 MHz, in one embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the example headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, as configured in a subscriber television system, to provide purchasable and recordable media (PRM) content services, either as an on-demand or scheduled service with a plurality of possible delivery durations. It will be understood that the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention. In the system headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> and a plurality of other application servers (not shown) are connected to a digital network control system (DNCS) <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> via an Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> preferably is responsible for the following: reserving and configuring system resources needed to provide PRM services, for packaging, configuring and making available the executable software program comprising a PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>), for providing configuration and service data (such as a catalog of recordable media content categorized and displayed by titles available for rent and/or purchase) to PRM application clients <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, and for storing data at the request of a PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, in communication with the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, reserve and configure system resources to effect the delivery of PRM content to a purchaser, as described below. A PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> executing on processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates a user interface that is displayed on television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) for the subscriber to browse, purchase, and access media content such as movies, CDs, video clips, etc. This may require, among other things, engaging, preferably, in a direct two-way IP (Internet Protocol) connection with VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> generates the user interface to provide similar functionality to the user interface generated via the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> provides management, monitoring, and control of the STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) network elements and broadcast services provided to users. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> provides control and communication functionality by monitoring the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and facilitating messaging between the DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and components within the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When any of the communication functionality is provided by headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> components other than the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> indirectly provides similar functionality by providing the control and coordination to those other devices that provide the required communication functionality to enact a particular media service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> includes functional support for client-server applications and other components in the STS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) with its server counterparts, including BFS Server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, which will be described in greater detail below. Briefly, the client-server application counterparts work in coordination with DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to effectively utilize the primary features of the interactive television system and manage the sale and delivery of, among other things, PRM content. Furthermore, the client-server application software in communication with the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> can effectively redirect allocation of excess VOD infrastructure capacity to facilitate maximum rate delivery of PRM content in cooperation with the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). Also, in one implementation, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> uses a data insertion multiplexer <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> and a data QAM <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to insert the in-band broadcast file system (BFS) data into a compressed data stream, for example, an MPEG-2 transport stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> also includes a session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and a conditional access system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> preferably uses the MPEG-2 DSM-CC protocol to coordinate requests for media content, for example, PRM content. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> processes user to network (U-N) session signaling messages, manages allocation of session-related network resources and supports network management operations. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> supports exclusive services, such as the PRM service, by providing the signaling interface to establish, maintain, and release client-initiated exclusive sessions. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> acts as a point of contact to the network for the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to establish individual sessions. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> also defines a resource descriptor structure, which is used to request the network resources within a session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The conditional access system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> communicates with the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the billing system <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to determine whether a particular subscriber is authorized to receive PRM content. If a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not authorized for PRM service, the conditional access system <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> insures that such services are not transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> communicates via the Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> to a service application manager (SAM) server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> contained in the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. Service application manager (SAM) server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is a server component of a client-server pair of components, with the client component being located at the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Together, the client-server SAM components provide a system in which the user can access services, which are identified by an application to run and one or more parameters, such as particular data content, specific to that service. The SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> also manages the life cycle of the applications on the system, including the definition, activation, and suspension of services they provide and the downloading of the applications into the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as necessary. The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> defines its application to the SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and the SAM server <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> instructs the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to add the executable code for the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) to a carousel (not shown) for distribution to the various DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, executable code is not transferred, but instead, functionality is effected through other mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is a part of a broadcast file system that has a BFS client <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) in each DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Applications on both the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can access the data stored in the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> in a manner somewhat similar to a file system found on disc operating systems. The BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> loads data for applications on a carousel (not shown) that sends data in a cyclical repeated fashion, each cycle approximately the same period of time so that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that communicates a request for any particular data may receive it when the user desires the data. Thus, the BFS client <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) contained in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that receives the broadcast from the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> can implement the application for the user, as will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> PRM content or data can reside in the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, in the VOD content server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, or in other application servers (not shown). The content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> deliver MPEG-2 content to a group of QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. PRM content can reside in VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> as a movie, as an audio program, or as an MPEG-2 private data program. The content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is responsible for managing the content on the VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and on other servers such as PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> or other application servers (not shown). The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> utilizes the content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to deliver the data, video and/or audio streams that make up the PRM services. The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> is in communication with the content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> to effect the delivery of PRM content that resides in VOD content servers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is actually a multiplex of QAMs that support PRM content transmission to a particular DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> determines which QAM modulator has access to a particular DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are also responsible for encrypting the transport stream and inserting other data and information into the stream, as will be described in more detail below. The QAM modulators <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> receive the MPEG-2 transport stream from the VOD content servers <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and convert it to an encrypted RF signal at a specified frequency (e.g. channel). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> fulfills management of VOD content and PRM content. In an alternate embodiment, content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is comprised of two entities, a first content manager dedicated to VOD content management and a second manager dedicated to PRM content management. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is responsible for transporting the out-of-band IP (Internet protocol) datagram traffic between the distribution headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Data from the QPSK modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is routed by headend router <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> within the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The headend router <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> is also responsible for delivering upstream application traffic, such as a user requests for PRM content, to the various application servers, such as, for example, PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is coupled to a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and to a television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention. Some of the functionality performed by applications executed in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (for example, the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>) may instead be performed at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and vice versa, in some embodiments. A DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is typically situated at the residence of a user or place of business and may be a stand-alone unit or integrated into another device such as, for example, a television set or a personal computer or an audio device, such as, for example, a programmable radio. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably includes a communications interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> for receiving signals (video, audio and/or other data) from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and for providing any reverse information to the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably includes at least one processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> for controlling operations of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an output system <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> for driving the television display <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, and at least one tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> for tuning into a particular television channel to be displayed and for sending and receiving various types of data or media content to and from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, multiple tuners can be used. The tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner and upstream transmitter for bi-directional QPSK data communication and a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) tuner (in-band) for receiving television signals. It should be appreciated that the OOB tuner and upstream transmitter can be one component, or in other embodiments, the tuner and transmitter can be independent of each other and located separately within the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The OOB tuner and upstream transmitter enables the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to interface with the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can provide upstream data to the network <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, for example, via a QPSK channel that serves as an upstream OOB channel and received by a QPSK receiver in QPSK modem <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a subscriber can interact with the subscriber television system to request services or the data of services such as, for example, PRM content. Alternatively, the upstream data transmission can be effected via a QAM channel with a QAM transmitter in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a QAM receiver in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a telephone modem in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be utilized for upstream data transmission. Further, a headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> or hub <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or other component located upstream in the subscriber television system may receive data from a telephone network coupled to a telephone modem and can route the upstream data to a destination internal or external to the subscriber television system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably includes a demultiplexing system <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> comprising functionality for QAM demodulation, forward error correction (FEC), transport demultiplexing, decryption (via decryptor <highlight><bold>588</bold></highlight>), and parsing, as is well known in the art, for signal processing of broadcast media content and data in the subscriber television system. Transport demultiplexing preferably includes MPEG-2 transport demultiplexing. The demultiplexing system <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> in communication with communication interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> and processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> effects reception of compressed video streams, compressed audio streams, and compressed data streams corresponding to a selected program to be separated from other programs and/or streams transported in the tuned transmission channel and to be eventually stored in secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, as will be described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> is a secure element for performing security and conditional access related functions. More particularly, the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> functions to authorize the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of a paying subscriber to execute specialized functionality of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as receiving and decrypting (or descrambling) encrypted (or scrambled) media content and other data sent from a remote device. Security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> preferably includes a microprocessor and a memory that only the microprocessor of the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> may access. Preferably, security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> is contained in a tamper proof package. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one implementation, encryption is applied to the data stream of the requested media content, for example the respective PRM content, at the QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> according to encryption methods well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. An encryption component resident in the QAM group <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> in the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and under the direction of the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> encrypts, for example, MPEG-2 transport stream packets used to transmit the PRM content. The encrypted PRM content also includes, in one embodiment, entitlement control messages that are recognized by the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) at the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as information needed to decrypt the encrypted PRM content. Security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> preferably stores authorization information, wherein the authorization information indicates that the subscriber is entitled to access the PRM content. The authorization information is obtained from one or more entitlement messages sent by the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> after, or concurrently with, initialization of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into a purchased service. If the authorization information indicates that the subscriber is entitled to the PRM content, security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> generates a code word or key based on the authorization information and the received entitlement control message, and the security processor <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> uses this key to decrypt the encrypted PRM content at the decryptor <highlight><bold>588</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a receiver <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> receives externally generated information, such as user inputs or commands from other devices. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may also include one or more wireless or wired interfaces, also called communication ports <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight>, for receiving and/or transmitting data to other devices. For example, communication ports can be configured as USB (Universal Serial Bus), Ethernet (for connection to a computer), IEEE-1394 (for connection to media devices in an entertainment center), or as serial and/or parallel data ports such as integrated drive electronics (IDE) or small computer system interface (SCSI) port. The user inputs may be, for example, provided by a computer or transmitter with buttons or keys located either on the exterior of the terminal or by a hand-held remote control device or keyboard that includes user-actuated buttons, or the user inputs may be aural. </paragraph>

The arrow buttons <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> include an up arrow button <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>, a down arrow button <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>, a left arrow button <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight>, and a right arrow button <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> that are used to scroll through options or selections and/or to highlight an option or selection displayed on one of the plurality of user interface screens described below. The select button <highlight><bold>387</bold></highlight> may be used to select a currently highlighted option or selection that is provided to the user. Lettered button &ldquo;A&rdquo; <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight>, &ldquo;B&rdquo; <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight>, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> may be used to implement functions on a user interface screen that have the corresponding letter. Numeric buttons <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> may be used to enter numbers, or configured with the application to enter letters corresponding to the numeric buttons <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight>. In describing the example screen displays (described below), it will be understood that &ldquo;selecting&rdquo; or &ldquo;pressing&rdquo; the navigational and lettered buttons on the screen actually require selecting the corresponding buttons, or keys, on remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. Many alternative methods of providing user input may be used including a remote control device with different buttons and/or button layouts, a keyboard device, a voice activated device, etc. The embodiments of the invention described herein are not limited by the type of device used to provide user input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, in one implementation, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes system memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight>, which includes FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>, for storing various applications, modules and data for execution and use by the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. Basic functionality of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided by an operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> that is primarily stored in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Among other elements, the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> includes at least one resource manager <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> that provides an interface to resources of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such as, for example, computing resources. An application referred to as a navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> is also resident in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> for providing a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel increment/decrement, last channel, favorite channel, etc. The navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> also provides users with television related menu options that correspond to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> functions such as, for example, blocking a channel or a group of channels from being displayed in a channel menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> also contains a platform library <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>. The platform library <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, an HTML parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> that are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> are a window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> and a service application manager client (SAM) <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and deallocation of the limited DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> screen display resources. It allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. The window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> also maintains, among other things, a user input registry <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> in DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. When a user enters a key or a command via the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> or another input device such as a keyboard or mouse, the user input registry <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is accessed to determine which of various applications running on the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> should receive data corresponding to the input key and in which order. As an application is executed, it registers a request to receive certain user input keys or commands. When the user presses a key corresponding to one of the commands on the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, the command is received by the receiver <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> and relayed to the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> dispatches the event to the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> where it is forwarded to the window manager <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> which ultimately accesses the user input registry <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and routes data corresponding to the incoming command to the appropriate application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component being located on the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> preferably in the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). A SAM database <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> (i.e. structured data such as a database or data structure) in DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> includes a data structure of services and a data structure of channels that are created and updated by the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Herein, database will refer to a database, structured data or other data structures as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Many services can be defined using the same application component, with different parameters. Examples of services include, without limitation and in accordance with one implementation, presenting television programs (available through a WatchTV application <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>), pay-per-view events (available through a PPV application <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight>), digital music (<highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>), video-on-demand (available through an VOD application <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>), purchasable recordable media (PRM) services (via PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>), and an interactive program guide (available through IPG application <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight>). In general, the identification of a service includes the identification of an executable application that provides the service along with a set of application-dependent parameters that indicate to the application the service to be provided. For example, a service of presenting a television program could be executed by WatchTV application <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> with a set of parameters specifying the HBO to view HBO or with a separate set of parameters to view CNN. Each association of the application component (tune video) and one parameter component (HBO or CNN) represents a particular service that has a unique service I.D. The client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> also interfaces with the resource manager <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight>, as discussed below, to control resources of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Application clients, or applications, can also be downloaded into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> at the request of the client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>, preferably in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> contains a video-on-demand application (VOD) <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>, an e-mail application <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight>, a PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, and a web browser application <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight>, among others. It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for one embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may, as an alternative embodiment, be resident in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. These applications, and others provided by the subscriber television system operator, are top level software entities on the network for providing services to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, applications executing on the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> work with the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> by abiding by several guidelines. First, an application, or application client, utilizes the client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> for the provision, activation, and suspension of services. Second, an application shares DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> resources with other applications and abides by the resource management policies of the client SAM <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight>, the operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>, and the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Third, an application handles situations where resources are only available with navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> intervention. Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, the application suspends the service via the SAM (the navigator <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized). Finally, an application is designed to not have access to certain user input keys reserved by the navigator (i.e., power, channel&plus;/&minus;, volume&plus;/&minus;, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to an application client, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in and execute out of DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and/or FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Likewise, data input into or output from any executable program can reside in DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> or FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an OS component, or to a client platform component, or to an application client, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>, or in a local storage device coupled to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and can be transferred into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program can reside in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> or a storage device, for example storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, and can be transferred into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data output by an executable program can be written into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> by an executable program or algorithm and can be transferred into FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> or into a storage device for storage purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> and a secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. The ability to record programming on the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> provides a convenient method to temporarily buffer programming to fit a viewing schedule, however, in accordance with one embodiment, for economic reasons the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may have a limited amount of primary storage. In one implementation, based on, for example, existing VCR usage patterns, there will be many occasions when the user will want to save or archive programs on the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> for later viewing or archive the programs for later reference. The primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is preferably internal to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and in electrical communication to an internal main bus for communication with other DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> elements through a data interface <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> implemented as a SCSI or IDE interface. In other embodiments, the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> can be externally connected to (and thus removable from) the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via a communication port (for example, <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight>) that is configured as a SCSI or an IDE interface. The primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is preferably a hard disk drive. The primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> preferably exhibits fast seek-time and high data transfer rates properties and its storage medium is preferably non-removable, such as in the case of a hard disk drive. Because the amount of data in one or more downloaded instances of PRM content typically surpasses the memory space allocated for application data in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight>, and because the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> features sufficiently large storage capacity, the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> serves, in one implementation, as a large repository or cache for downloaded PRM content. Alternatively, memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> may be large enough (and fast enough) to accommodate data transfers without the need for the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, under the auspices of the real-time operating system <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight> executed by processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, and in coordination with PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight>, downloaded PRM content and/or data is received in DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via communications interface <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> and stored in a temporary buffer (not shown) in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight>. Herein, PRM content and other media content will be understood to also refer to other types of data in addition to, or instead of, media content. The temporary buffer is implemented and managed to enable data transfers from the temporary buffer to the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> in concert with the insertion of a newly arriving PRM content into the temporary buffer. The fast access time and high data transfer rate characteristics of primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> enables PRM content to be read from the temporary buffer in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> and written to the storage medium of primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> in a sufficiently fast manner. Orchestration of multiple simultaneous data transfer operations is effected so that while PRM content is being transferred from memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> to primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, new PRM content is received and stored in the temporary buffer. The coordination of data transfers and lower latency characteristics of primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> enable PRM content to be received by DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at high data rates. The primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> functions to store PRM content that is received by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on an interim basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> For permanent or semi-permanent storage, the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> comprises a storage media drive, internally or externally connected to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in a similar fashion as the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, but featuring at least one high-capacity removable storage medium and, in one implementation, slower seek-time and lower data transfer rates characteristics. The secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is preferably a multiple compact disc (CD) drive or multiple digital video disc (DVD) carousel or magazine drive that at least has write capability, but may also have read capability among other capabilities. Alternatively, the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> may be a single CD drive or DVD drive with at least write capability, but may also have read capability among other capabilities, or the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> can be a video recorder (VCR or D-VCR) or other data recorder. Alternatively, the carousel may be a magazine type. In one implementation, the PRM content that is received and stored on the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is transferred by way of memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> wherein it is written to one or more removable media residing in the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. The transfer of PRM content from primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> to secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> can occur concurrently to the download of the respective PRM contain in a coordinated sequential fashion or after the respective PRM content has been completely received and stored in the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. In the former case a second temporary buffer (not shown) in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> is utilized to implement the transfer of PRM content from the primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> to secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Given its faster seek time and higher data transfer rate characteristics, primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> preferably operates faster than the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, PRM content is transferred from memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> with higher data rate transfer characteristics, or yet in other embodiments, PRM content is transferred from a remote server or other remote device to a DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> communication port and then directly to the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, media content (including PRM content) is first recorded/stored in a primary data buffer (not shown, but for example, in primary storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>) and indexed by content ID and record date/time information (i.e. meta data). The minimum content ID information collected is the originating channel number but could include program ID (PID) or other media content and media content description information. The record date/time information is simply the date/time the recording was made and is used by the system for data management/purge and can also be used by the subscriber, via archiving mechanisms of the PRM application, as one of several methods to locate previously recorded media content. The media content recorded in the primary buffer is available for viewing and disposition by the subscriber. Media content can be viewed, deleted, or spooled along with the data accessible by universal or widely adopted access and naming conventions (e.g., as is characteristically in meta data) to a secondary buffer (not shown, but for instance, in secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>) for longer term storage and playback. Media content left in the primary buffer are subject to be deleted (i.e. the associated disk space made writeable) by new media content. In one embodiment, the secondary buffer is located on removable media that can be stored for future playback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Also as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably includes access to a printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, either connected locally to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or via a home communication network via communication port <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, the printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> prints labels to be applied to the removable media (i.e., CDs or DVDs) of the secondary storage device <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. Preferably, these labels convey, at least, verification of purchase and authenticity of the data written to the media. Thus, in one implementation, labels are printed by the printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> as a result of an execution signal received by the printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> from the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> as a result of an authorized purchase of PRM content in which authorization was granted from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may operate without the printer <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> configures the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the download, purchase, and billing of PRM content, including configuring the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for receipt of trial and impulse purchases of PRM content. The PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> preferably is downloaded into DRAM <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> may be resident in FLASH memory <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>. To offer PRM service, in one implementation, the subscriber television system operator assigns a portion of the downstream and upstream bandwidth capacity in the subscriber television system to be dedicated for transmission of PRM content. The amount of bandwidth capacity that can be allocated to the PRM service is finite. Grants for requests to download (i.e. transmit) PRM content may be limited during peak-time periods that correspond to high bandwidth consumption by a plurality of other services. On the other hand, off-peak-time periods may feature unused bandwidth capacity intended for other services that can be repossessed for downloading of PRM content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the amount of bandwidth capacity allocated for PRM service varies throughout time to reflect bandwidth consumption by a plurality of bandwidth consuming services, including but not limited to VOD services. During peak periods of other bandwidth consuming services such as, for example, video-on-demand (VOD), the amount of bandwidth capacity allocated to the PRM service is less than during the off-peak periods. Consequently, the duration for downloading a PRM content instance during peak-periods is typically longer than the duration for downloading a PRM content instance during off-peak periods. For example, VOD off-peak periods may run from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM during the first week of May. Accordingly, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will allot bandwidth for downloading PRM content by repossessing the off-peak unused bandwidth assigned to video on-demand services via a plurality of DTSs <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, under coordination and communication between content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, and PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, PRM content is transferred from PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> or other application servers (not shown) to VOD content server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> via Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> to effect PRM content delivery over repossessed unused bandwidth intended for VOD services. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> communicates the frequency where unused bandwidth is repossessed to subscriber DHCTs requesting PRM services (i.e. subscribers who have elected downloads of PRM content during these times) resulting in the tuner system <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) of a requesting DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to tune to the corresponding frequency to receive the downloadable PRM content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, again referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, under coordination and communication between content manager <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, BFS <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, and PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, purchased PRM content that resides in the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> or in other application servers are transmitted for product delivery from the server wherein media content resides to the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> via Ethernet connection <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. A particular PRM content instance may reside indefinitely in BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> due to the high demand of that particular content or content instance, or temporarily during times of unused BFS bandwidth. In another embodiment, introduction of new media content releases, such as games or audio content, may reside in the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> for a finite period, such as a month, starting from their introduction time. Alternatively, PRM content may reside in a BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> for periods of times in which BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> exhibits unused bandwidth capacity. Thus, the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) employs available bandwidth capacity using in-band or out-of-band services or a combination thereof. Numerous unique combinations of PRM content delivery may be employed when lacking bandwidth resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> According to one implementation, bandwidth allocation for PRM service is managed according to a series of recurring sub-schedules consisting of a plurality of non-overlapping time intervals as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. &ldquo;N&rdquo; sub-schedules are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, with the understanding that a plurality of sub-schedules may appear between sub-schedule &num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and sub-schedule &num;N. Time intervals are demarcated by time marks <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, etc., on horizontal time axis <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, and represent times within a 24 hour period. The interval between these time marks, such as between time marks <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, represent a period during the 24 hour period, for example, 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM. The time mark <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, continuing the example, would represent 9:00 AM, and thus this interval will span 4 hours (time mark <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, which is 9:00 AM minus time mark <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> (5:00 AM) equals 4 hours). The corresponding bandwidth allotted during these time intervals is represented by the blocks over the corresponding time intervals, such as block <highlight><bold>590</bold></highlight> over the second time interval bordered between time marks <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. Allocated bandwidth goes from, for example, zero at the intersection point <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of the horizontal time axis <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and vertical bandwidth axis <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> in sub-schedule&num;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to increasing bandwidth when advancing up from zero at intersection <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the time intervals vary in length and are established with demarcation according to collected historical data of bandwidth consumption patterns for a plurality of services. Allocation of bandwidth capacity may vary between one time interval to the next. Pricing for each respective PRM content instance may or may not vary in each of the respective time intervals according to, in one implementation, whether the time interval is a peak period or not. For example, during peak periods, such as 6:00 to 11:00 P.M. of the week nights, the recurring schedule may exhibit higher pricing for PRM services whereas during certain, low-demand time periods such as 6:00 to 11:00 A.M. of the weekend days the pricing will be lower. As disclosed below, other factors such as demand for new releases and popular media content may also influence pricing. Therefore, allocation of bandwidth capacity for PRM services can be configured to adapt in a time-specific manner according to a plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The allocated bandwidth PRM services can be configured to switch as time progresses from a first allocation sub-schedule to a second allocation sub-schedule according to a main schedule that specifies the time interval when each of two or more sub-schedules is to be active as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the plan may consist, in one embodiment, of scheduling for the year with multiple schedules <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, further administered with fewer schedules on a per week basis <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, and administered with even fewer schedules on a daily basis <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. For example, only one configurable sub-schedule is active at a time throughout the configurable recurring schedule but a first configurable sub-schedule may be active throughout one or more distinct and non-overlapping time intervals of the configurable recurring schedule. The recurrence of the schedule is configured to one of a plurality of time periods such as a weekly, daily, or a monthly recurring schedule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to another possible bandwidth allocation schedule, a multiplicity of time-adaptive schedules for each of a multiplicity of recurring schedule choices are preconfigured. In this embodiment, the cable system operator may monitor the bandwidth and PRM service usage and be given the option of manually implementing one of the pre-configured allocation schedules without following a plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) may automatically monitor bandwidth usage and automatically select one of the pre-configured schedules. For instance, six different configurations may be available for time-adaptive management of the bandwidth allocated for PRM services for a daily recurring schedule. On the other hand, more than six different arrangements may be necessary when implementing time-adaptive bandwidth management on a weekly recurring schedule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the user is presented with an interactive program guide (IPG) <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> which has PRM icons next to varied media content selections, suggesting to the user the availability of a downloadable and recordable option for those selections. The icons, and their screen coordinates, can be stored locally as an attribute in each program (i.e. media content) record, like stereo or second audio program (SAP) attributes. The program records can be stored in a database in the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, for example an IPG database <highlight><bold>483</bold></highlight> or the PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). Alternatively, the program records can be maintained at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Any application can display the icon after, for example, the program title in the application graphical user interface (GUI) presentation (e.g. IPG <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight>). For example, selections <highlight><italic>Saving Private Ryan </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>American History </italic></highlight>under the PPV category <highlight><bold>776</bold></highlight> have icon &ldquo;CD/DVD&rdquo; next to them suggesting to the user that these selections are available for downloading to a recordable medium, such as a CD or DVD. In another embodiment, the user may be presented with a service guide option <highlight><bold>876</bold></highlight> such as in the example IPG <highlight><bold>890</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Upon selecting the service guide option <highlight><bold>876</bold></highlight>, the user is presented with service selections in a service guide, such as example service guide <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the PRM service <highlight><bold>1075</bold></highlight> may be a selectable service entity, as illustrated in example service guide <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Selecting the PRM service <highlight><bold>1075</bold></highlight> from the example service guide <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> may present various media content options that are purchasable recorded media content, categorized, for example, in media content categories such as music, movies, software, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example VOD selection screen display <highlight><bold>1170</bold></highlight> responsive to the user entering the VOD catalog selection <highlight><bold>958</bold></highlight> in the example service guide <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. A similarly formatted screen may be presented, for example, if the user selects from the service guide <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) a PPV selection <highlight><bold>957</bold></highlight>, or music selection <highlight><bold>959</bold></highlight>, or software selection <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the user is presented with an information screen display <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight> that includes a select button <highlight><bold>1176</bold></highlight>, which provides the user the ability to rent or purchase the highlighted selection <highlight><bold>1173</bold></highlight>. By pressing the select button <highlight><bold>1176</bold></highlight>, the user is presented with a user interface screen (not shown) that provides the user with an option to either download (purchase) the highlighted selection <highlight><bold>1173</bold></highlight> for recording and thus for indefinite personal possession (i.e. buy), or rent. The PRM service is integrated into the VOD catalog, in one embodiment, as another option (like price). In one implementation, the system operator may choose what VOD content is available for PRM service and then program the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) accordingly. In another implementation, the content provider may offer certain VOD content with PRM service, which is then a feature provided to the user through the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Once the user selects the aforementioned download option (not shown), the user will be presented with the example PRM purchase screen illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and described below. Note that the screen display <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight> also includes an information button <highlight><bold>1177</bold></highlight>, which enables the user to learn more about the highlighted selection <highlight><bold>1173</bold></highlight> they seek to purchase or rent. If the user selects rent, conventional VOD processing occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Once the user has decided on a media content selection for downloading, either by entering a selection in an IPG, a service guide, or during the presentation of a particular media content instance as part of an impulse purchase, the user is presented with an example purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, this purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> may be invoked as a mini-program located within the PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) &ldquo;called&rdquo; by another application, for example, during a VOD session when the user has selected the purchase option over the rental option, or during a media content instance presentation from a service upon the user requesting an impulse buy. Alternatively, PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> functionality may exist as a sub-routine within the current media service application in session. Alternatively, PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> functionality may exist as software in the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes title header <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> identifying the media service from which the PRM content instance will be purchased. Subtitle header <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> suggests the purpose of the purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, which is to select download and price options. The reduced screen area <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight> displays an image from the media content instance to be purchased. Assuming that the movie selection was Titanic, a picture of a representative scene for the highlighted movie may be presented. Similarly, pictures of representative spreadsheets from a software product selected may be displayed, or a picture of a song artist may be displayed for the music selection, all mentioned by way of example. Information section <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> contains some characterizing information about the media content purchase, including but not limited to media content title, date of composition, rating, download time, and available purchase window. Content quality index <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> provides the user with content quality options, such as, for example, high definition television or standard definition, surround sound, etc. A higher quality option may require additional consumption of system resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As with other user interface screens described previously, the user preferably advances highlight block <highlight><bold>1222</bold></highlight> over a desired content quality option of the content quality index <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> by using left scroll arrow <highlight><bold>1226</bold></highlight> or right scroll arrow <highlight><bold>1228</bold></highlight>. Selections preferably advance until an end is reached in the list, or alternatively, selections may &ldquo;wrap-around&rdquo; in a manner whereby the selections repeat themselves. Download option list <highlight><bold>1246</bold></highlight> contains download options. The user advances the highlight block <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> over the desired download option by using up arrow <highlight><bold>1262</bold></highlight> and down arrow <highlight><bold>1268</bold></highlight>, and a corresponding price for that option and content quality is displayed in the price block <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight>. Pricing for PRM content and the planning and/or scheduling of bandwidth are inherently related, as the price structure will depend on, among other factors, the time of the download and the duration of the download. In a subscriber television system that markets PRM content with a plurality of prices, a first subscriber may be willing to pay a premium to immediately download a PRM content instance that is purchased during a peak-period. A second subscriber may pay a lesser purchase fee when purchasing a PRM content instance during a peak-period but selecting to download the purchased PRM content instance at a later time corresponding to an off-peak period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the PRM service offers a plurality of prices for a PRM content instance, and each respective price is associated with a different downloading time and a download duration. The price assigned to each available download option may depend on a number of factors. Demand for a PRM content instances, such as for new releases and popular media content instances, may influence pricing. The amount of bandwidth consumed to download the PRM content instance (and hence the download duration), the time of day, the day of the week (weekday, weekend, or holiday), and the amount of time that the subscriber has to wait until the downloading operation starts also influence the price. Other factors that influence pricing of a PRM content instance include the PRM content type (e.g., audio, movie, or game), the PRM content quality (e.g., CD quality or surround sound quality audio; standard or high-definition picture quality), and the delivery mode (e.g., repossessed VOD excess bandwidth or via BFS services). In the example purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the user highlights an immediate download option, but other options (not shown) include downloads with a duration ending after a defined period (e.g. 1 hour) beginning from the download selection and purchase of the PRM content, and delayed download starts for subsequent immediate or extended duration, for example. Furthering this example, the user has indicated a desire for standard definition video with standard sound (as illustrated by the option within highlight block <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>), but other content quality options can be scrolled to and selected. Price block <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> shows that the resultant price for this download configuration is $5.99. Other download options can be presented as the user scrolls through the list, including lower priced downloads during traditional off-peak VOD time periods (e.g. early morning), &ldquo;trickle&rdquo; downloads (i.e. extended duration downloads), downloads that have a delayed start, but are immediate or are extended, or downloads with varying quality levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Other features illustrated in the example purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> include interactive mechanisms for the user. The select button <highlight><bold>1264</bold></highlight> enables the user to purchase the desired selection. The user may select the &ldquo;B&rdquo; more movie information button <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to learn more details about the movie the user is about to purchase. The user may also select the &ldquo;C&rdquo; movie purchases button <highlight><bold>1232</bold></highlight> to return to the main media content screen, for example, the VOD catalog screen as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, to consider other movie purchases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) and the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) communicate via system communication resources and functionality extended via communication with DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> provides for a user interface for specification of downloading options in communication and cooperation with PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> and in cooperation with other client applications, for example VOD <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight> and PPV <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> and Music <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> applications (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>), as described above. Alternatively, the user interface may be provided from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The information provided on PRM user interface screens, such as the purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), is supported by the PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). Similar to an IPG application <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) that has an IPG database <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) of records in which program information is supported by client-server IPG counterparts, the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> employs the PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> of records that comprises PRM content information pertaining to PRM content for presentation to a subscriber. The PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> contains sufficient information for the presentation of available PRM content at the current time and for subsequent periods. The PRM content information comprises data organized into records of the PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> with record fields containing, but not limited to, information such as PRM content title, PRM content description, PRM genre, release year, casts or performers list, ratings information, and play duration for each PRM content instance. PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> also comprises of downloadable content information as well as information comprising downloadable options for a plurality of intervals, starting with the interval corresponding to the current time. Pricing information associated with a downloadable option constitutes another part of PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> to facilitate pricing updates throughout the progression of time. Alternatively, pricing information may reflect association with PRM content title (i.e. each instance) as well and a price may be associated with each PRM title and downloadable option pair. Downloadable options for a particular interval are displayable in a purchase screen, such as purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Since the downloadable options available in a first interval may be different from the downloadable options for a second interval, PRM client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> dynamically adapts displayed information according to available download options as the user navigates throughout different intervals. Downloadable content information, downloadable options information, and pricing information may be separate structures of PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> or one or any combination thereof. The effective window of calendar days in which respective PRM content is purchasable may also be included. Additional information may be included in aggregate fields to denote a PRM content instance rating and consequently support invoking parental control of media content via the PIN entry screen. Other fields designate information about the person that purchased and recorded the media content instance, the seller, the date purchased, the date recorded, and the method of sale (i.e., PRM purchase). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> PRM content information associated with PRM content is transmitted on a regular or periodic basis from PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to one or more DHCTs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). The PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, in communication with PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>), effects updates to the PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) stored in memory <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) or in a storage device (such as storage device <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) of DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> reads PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> records and processes them into a displayable representation as part of a GUI presentation displayed on a television <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) or similar display device for presentation to a subscriber. As described above, PRM content information may comprise descriptive information to populate the entries of a PRM guide, a service guide, or an IPG presentation with the corresponding PRM fields that are presented to the subscriber via a GUI from which a subscriber can select and request additional descriptive information about respective PRM content. Hence, per PRM content in the displayed presentation to the subscriber, the subscriber can retrieve and view (and hear if applicable) information specific to a PRM content title and proceed to purchase specific PRM content (i.e. one or more PRM content instances). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Considering the download options, such as those illustrated in the purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) for example, communication between PRM server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) effects PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> to omit an unavailable download option (or add an available option) in the set of download options <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Based on information received from PRM server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> interprets the information and accordingly adapts the displayed options presented to the user. Received information includes available downloadable options for each of a plurality of intervals, starting with an interval demarcated with a start time equal to the current time and spanning into subsequent future intervals. Availability of download options for intervals in the future can vary as subscribers schedule download options and possibly exhaust network resources for a particular download option during an interval. On the other hand, a particular download option that is unavailable for a future interval becomes available to a second subscriber when a first subscriber cancels a scheduled download option and indirectly return network resources to fulfill the particular download option requested by second subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the PRM server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in communication with the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) update the planning and scheduling mechanism (as described in association with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 &amp; 6</cross-reference>) throughout the progression of time to reflect availability of download options for the plurality of intervals and this information is transmitted from PRM server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). As a non-limiting example, the updated information for adapting the download options is transmitted by employing the messaging and signaling capabilities of the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, and the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is employed to deliver the updated information. In one embodiment, the updates are performed on a periodic schedule ahead of the start time of the next predetermined interval to allow sufficient time for PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> to present the most recent availability of download options to a user. As a non-limiting example, interval can start on 10 minute increments and updates to download options can transpire 5 minutes before each interval (and thus also <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> minutes apart). Updates to downloadable options may also update pricing information for the respective downloadable option to reflect supply and demand. In an alternate embodiment, updates to download options availability are conducted by PRM server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> in communication with DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> upon each requested download grant to a first DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> but transmitted to a second DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> upon a subsequent download request generated by second DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The download request of the user (as selected, for example, through the purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, or unavailable barkers as will be discussed below) can be characterized in several ways. For example, the download type is one characterization. The download type refers to the manner in which the download is accomplished, for example, either as a file via out-of-band transmission (e.g. via BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), a file via in-band transmission, or an on-demand session via in-band transmission. Further characterization involves the repository that stores the requested content in headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). For example, downloadable content may reside in VOD content server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), or be placed in VOD content server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> for the duration of the download to effect an on-demand in-band transmission. Downloadable content can reside in BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> or be placed there throughout the duration of the download. Other characterizations include the bandwidth required to effect the download type, the start-time when the subscriber wants to begin the download of the selected PRM content, and the span of time (i.e. duration) of the download beginning from the start-time. The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) attempts to allocate and assign resources at the selected start-time and for the duration required to fulfill the PRM download request from the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). As a non-limiting example, network resources (i.e. download resources) to effect a download option include downstream bandwidth, signaling support, and server storage. A download option can be further characterized as a deterministic versus non-deterministic transmission. Transmission of content throughout pockets of time when network resources become available to effect part of the download constitutes a non-deterministic transmission. The user can be notified upon completion of the download, for example with an audible signal, a displayed graphical message on TV <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>, or a displayed code in the front-panel of DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the user requests PRM content through the purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), or a similar screen for purchasing PRM content with different options, as described above, and the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) attempts to allocate resources to provide the download of the requested PRM content. For a scheduled download, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> queries the application servers of the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to determine if resources are available to fulfill the scheduled download that the subscriber is requesting, and provide notice to the user if service was unavailable. Further, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> can also detect PRM service interruptions that may occur during a download, such as in the case of an emergency or network malfunction. In one implementation, where VOD excess (repossessed) bandwidth capacity is employed to fulfill a PRM content instance purchase request, and with continued reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 &amp; 4A</cross-reference>, a &ldquo;session&rdquo; between the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) and the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is set throughout the course of downloading the PRM content instance. Upon the subscriber purchasing a PRM content instance for a price via the displayed user interface (i.e. the subscriber enters input via an input device and such input may comprise a password or PIN to authenticate authorization to purchase the PRM content instance), as described above in association with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> purchase transaction is executed by the processor <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>), as configured by the PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>), that, in one implementation, causes a session to be set-up between subscriber television system resources to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As facilitated by session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), a session is a logical entity used to define a connection between the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) and the VOD content server <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and the resources used to maintain that connection in the subscriber television system. Session manager <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> coordinates and effects the signaling required to implement the session which is preferably defined by the MPEG-2 standard ISO/IEC 13818-6 IS (MPEG-2 DSM-CC). Upon a session setup request generated by the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (usually in response to a request from a subscriber), the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> verifies the eligibility of the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to receive the PRM service. The amount of bandwidth that will be reserved for the duration of the PRM service session is communicated to the relevant servers and headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) components. Via the messaging capabilities of DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) sends a message to the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that indicates that it is ready to begin delivering the video content using the resources allocated. The DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receives information in the message identifying the QAM modulator <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) that is transmitting the video content (and hence where to tune to receive the requested content) and the bandwidth allocated to deliver the service. After a session has been established, the DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> communicates directly with the server in which the content resides, as identified to DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, to facilitate delivery of the requested PRM service. In certain instances, PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> may contain the requested content. Throughout the course of time that a PRM service is active, further messaging is conducted between the respective DHCT <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> receiving the PRM content and the PRM application server <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to monitor the status of the session, as provisioned by the signaling and messaging mechanisms and capabilities in the network. In one implementation, PRM content is delivered via the BFS server <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, where a session need not be established. However, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> allocates resources for the download of requested PRM content whether a session set-up is required or not, for the duration of time required to effect the download. In one embodiment, the download is effected in a series of intervals scheduled throughout pockets of time for which network resources are projected to be available or as they become available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) provides for a plurality of GUIs when PRM content, selected by a user in one of the PRM content purchase screens (e.g. example screen display <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), is unavailable. The GUI screens that are prompted when PRM content is unavailable are prompted using different information than the information that is used for the initial PRM purchase screens. For example, the download options list <highlight><bold>1246</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) provides the user with a list of options anticipated via the planning and scheduling mechanisms discussed in association with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. That is, options are based on a projected bandwidth usage, peak times, etc., that are all factors relevant to furnishing the GUI download options list <highlight><bold>1246</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Nevertheless, projected versus actual resource availability can differ throughout the course of time or at different instances throughout the course of time. For actual PRM service consumption, resource allocation for the requested PRM content, delivered according to download options selected via the purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), has to be allocated and assigned by the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to the subscriber for consumption, and thus the PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> waits for a grant acknowledgement from the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. Thus, when a subscriber selects a download option, mechanisms are put into effect which may result in the identification of insufficient resources to effect the PRM download as initially requested by the subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) will receive notice from the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) when the resources necessary to fulfill the requested download cannot be met. The PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> will responsively generate an unavailable-service barker comprising a choice of alternate download options, as will be described below in association with FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the unavailable-service barker can be generated at the headend <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are screen diagrams depicting example unavailable-service barker screens that provide the user with a notice of unavailability of requested PRM service and alternative download options in the event of the service unavailability. As described above, the DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, upon receiving a request that resources could not be allocated during the scheduled time requested, determines when the download can be available and forwards these options to the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> for presentation to the user via a GUI presented, in one implementation, as an unavailable-service barker. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a screen diagram depicting an example barker screen <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> resulting when a particular subscriber request for PRM content cannot be fulfilled. For this example, and others that follow, assume the highlighted user download selection made in the example purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, with the understanding that similar mechanisms are employed to present alternate download options when PRM content associated with a different initial download option is selected. Top portion <highlight><bold>1351</bold></highlight> contains a heading describing the problem to the user, a bottom portion <highlight><bold>1352</bold></highlight> illustrating relevant navigation button(s) available on the remote control device <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>) for interacting with the example barker screen <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, and a top center portion <highlight><bold>1353</bold></highlight> which provides the user with a message, for example: &ldquo;SORRY, PRM SERVICE IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR YOUR SCHEDULED 10:00 DOWNLOAD. SELECT AN AVAILABLE OPTION OR &ldquo;C&rdquo; TO CANCEL&rdquo;. The user may use up arrow <highlight><bold>1360</bold></highlight> or down arrow <highlight><bold>1364</bold></highlight> to advance the highlighted box <highlight><bold>1366</bold></highlight> over the desired download option from download options list <highlight><bold>1354</bold></highlight>. The user may then enter their selection by pressing the select button <highlight><bold>1362</bold></highlight>. In this example barker screen <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, the user has scrolled through the download options list <highlight><bold>1354</bold></highlight> for download options that provide the initially requested PRM content at an earlier time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Download option list <highlight><bold>1354</bold></highlight> provides the user with a list of available download options, the content quality (e.g. high definition television versus standard definition) if different from the content quality initially selected, and price (if different from the price of the initial selection). The download options will be generated using information stored in the PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) for PRM application <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) similar to the database retrieval and presentation mechanisms employed to generate the initial PRM content purchase screen (e.g. purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Alternatively, content quality and price can always be displayed. Alternatively, a screen may be presented such that the user is presented with a button to select alternative download options from purchase screens, such as for example, purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Also, as described above, there exists a variety of information collected in the PRM database <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) that can be used for display presentation to the user. In this example, the user has scrolled through the list to find that the PRM content can be downloaded at an earlier time than the time that the user initially requested. The screen display may present the alternate options at the same price, or at a different price, or no price, depending on the several pricing factors discussed above in association with the purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example screen display <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> that depicts the situation where the alternate download selection scrolled to and displayed in download options list <highlight><bold>1454</bold></highlight> presents a download option that is scheduled for a later time. As noted, the user is presented with a message that a selected download option, such as that selected in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> or similar screen, could not be met. Further, a list of available options are presented in download options list <highlight><bold>1454</bold></highlight> that the user can scroll through to find a suitable alternative to his or her initial selection of PRM content. The user has scrolled to a point in the list that presents an option to choose a later time for the download. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example screen display <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> that depicts the situation where the selected download from purchase screen <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) is unavailable, and the user has scrolled through the download options list <highlight><bold>1554</bold></highlight> to a download option that offers a different download duration. In this embodiment, the PRM content is transmitted over an extended duration at a lower bandwidth as the bandwidth availability varies throughout the day or non-deterministically as network resources become available. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> depicts the situation where the alternate download option from download options list <highlight><bold>1654</bold></highlight> of example screen display <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight> can be met at the scheduled time requested, but at a quality level different from what was requested initially by the user. For instance, suppose the user has selected a high definition television option for his initial download request. Because standard definition television consumes significantly less bandwidth in comparison to high definition television, the download options presented can include scheduled download times at lower quality levels that may be offered in close time-proximity to the initial requested time of download. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example screen display <highlight><bold>1700</bold></highlight> that depicts the situation where the user is presented with a stand-by option. As with the previous example screen displays, the user has scrolled through the list of alternate download options of download options list <highlight><bold>1754</bold></highlight> and has come to the option that provides the user the choice of waiting a period of time in the stand-by mode. For instance, another subscriber may cancel a scheduled download that was to take effect in, for example, the next half hour. With the user selecting the stand-by option displayed in the download options list, the bandwidth made available (i.e. &ldquo;freed-up&rdquo;) via the other subscriber&apos;s cancellation is now available to meet the stand-by user request. In one embodiment, the user is presented with a confirmation barker (not shown) that is prompted when the PRM content is available to be downloaded. In another embodiment, the download can take place and the user can be notified while the download is occurring, or the user can be notified after the download has occurred, or both. In another embodiment, the user can be notified of the download by an LED display on the DHCT. In another embodiment, the user can be notified by an audio signal, or a tone. The audio signal, or tone, can be implemented alone or in concert with the visual notification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a screen diagram of an example screen display <highlight><bold>1800</bold></highlight> that depicts the situation where the user scrolls to an option that provides an alternate PRM content title (e.g. movie title, like <highlight><italic>American Psycho</italic></highlight>) for the scheduled time. This option can be presented, for instance, at a reduced charge in comparison to the scheduled download, or in other embodiments, a reduced charge relative to standard pricing for the scheduled download. In other implementations, the price can be the same or greater than the initially requested selection. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> depicts the situation where the user has scrolled to an &ldquo;over-ride&rdquo; option. An &ldquo;over-ride&rdquo; option is where the user can request that he or she receive the initially requested PRM content at the scheduled time, despite the unavailable notice, but the &ldquo;over-ride&rdquo; option can be at a higher price than the option initially selected. In this option, bandwidth can be preserved by the system operator for situations where users just need to have the PRM content downloaded at the desired time. The option can be presented at a higher price than is typically offered for that PRM content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The DNCS <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> operating software and the PRM application client <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> which comprise an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions, can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. In the context of this document, a &ldquo;computer-readable medium&rdquo; can be any means that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium.
