<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention offers a non-charging resin composite material and method for manufacturing said resin composite material. In particular, a non-charging resin composite material can be manufactured by using liquid containing metal ions to treat the surface of a resin base treated with ion-exchange group introduction agent, thereby introducing metal ions. By then converting said metal ions, a component containing metal element is introduced at the surface of the resin base in such a small amount that charging of the resin base can be prevented, without increasing the low conductivity intrinsic to the resin base to above a certain level, which has been difficult in the past. With said non-charging resin composite material, damage due to the adhesion of dirt or dust on the base is prevented, as is damage to the base caused by static electricity resulting from charging. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a non-charging resin composite material wherein a component containing metal element is present at the surface of a resin base, and a method for manufacturing the aforementioned non-charging resin composite material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Resin bases constituting electronic parts that are composed of epoxy resin, polyimide resin and other such resins, and bases composed of resins such as ABS resin, methyl methacrylate, polyethylene and vinyl chloride are poor conductors of electricity, and thus readily charge due to friction, etc. With charged bases, a base can be readily marred due to discharge of static electricity arising from charging, and dirt and durst tend to adhere to the base due to static electricity. This makes processing of said resin base difficult, which is a particularly serious problem in the manufacture of precision parts that cannot permit the presence of marring, fine dirt or dust on the base. In addition, there are many products in which the adhesion of dust and dirt due to charging is undesirable in post-processed resin products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The best way to prevent charging in resin bases is to prevent the isolation of electric charge, but there are currently many aspects of the charging mechanism that are unclear, and a solution to the problem is thus difficult. In order to reduce local electric fields formed due to charge isolation, charging is prevented by covering the surface with a high-dielectric material, by ionizing air in the vicinity with the objective of increasing isolated charge leak rate, or coating the surface with a substance having a large dielectric constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Examples of methods for preventing charging are temporary charging prevention methods and long-term charging prevention methods. Examples of temporary charge-prevention methods, are air ionization methods and methods in which a material is coated with a surfactant or substance having surfactant as primary component, thereby increasing moisture absorption at the base surface, and decreasing the resistance of the surface. These methods, however, are lacking in persistence, and are used only with the objective of manifesting effects for a determinate period of time in order to eliminate processing problems during processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An example of a long-term charge prevention method is a method in which conductive substance such as silver or copper powder is introduced into the resin base. A mode for introduction of conductive substances into resin base is a method in which conducive substance is incorporated into the resin base. In such cases, characteristics that are intrinsic to the resin base can be lost, such as the low conductivity that is characteristic of resin bases. Grain size and distribution of the metal are important factors in incorporating metals while maintaining the characteristics of a resin base, but it is extremely difficult to obtain a resin base having the desired properties while admixing metal and controlling these factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another mode of introducing conductive substance into a resin base are methods in which metal is introduced at the surface of the resin base. Examples of this type of introduction method include metal vapor deposition, casting methods and plating methods. When introducing metal at the surface of the resin base, there are problems with the amount of metal introduced related to binding between the metal and the resin base, but with these methods, it is not always necessary to introduce metal with good binding properties. In addition, it is difficult to introduce metal at an amount whereby charging is sufficiently eliminated without increasing the conductivity at the base surface above a certain level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For example, when the resin constituting the resin base is polyimide resin, it is difficult to form bumps that will have an anchoring effect, and so providing sufficient binding is more difficult than with other resins. In addition, with ABS resin, round pits are formed by the preferential elution of butadiene particles during etching with chromic acid-sulfuric acid mixed solution, and so it is possible to improve binding by providing anchoring effects. With epoxy resin or polyimide resin, it is possible to improve binding by providing non-uniformities at the surface by etching the epoxy resin with permanganic acid solution, etc. However, even when metal is introduced by widely-used electroless plating carried out after etching the surface as a pretreatment, it is extremely difficult to introduce metal in extremely small amounts so that charging can be prevented without increasing the conductivity above a certain level. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For this reason, there is strong demand for a method whereby component containing extremely small amounts of metal element is introduced at the surface of the resin base at levels at which charging of the resin base can be prevented without increasing the low conductivity intrinsic to the resin base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, a non-charging resin composite material is desired that has component containing extremely small amounts of metal element at the surface of a resin base at levels at which charging of the resin base can be prevented without increasing the low conductivity intrinsic to the resin base. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, controlling the value of &ldquo;the ratio of the resin composite material surface resistance to the metal element-containing component resistance&rdquo; means controlling the amount of component containing metal element present at the surface of the resin composite material.

The resin base can be composed of individual resins, or can be composed of multiple resins. In addition, the surface that is treated with ion exchange group introduction agent need not be the resin base, as the base can be a composite formed by applying or laminating a resin onto another base. </paragraph>

It is additionally desirable for the resin to be selected from a group comprising epoxy resin, polyimide resin, polyphenylene ether resin, ABS resin or mixtures thereof, and for the metal sulfide to be selected from a group comprising CuS, CdS, ZnS, PdS, Ag<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When the component containing metal element is a metal oxide, the combination of resin and metal oxide is preferably one wherein the resin is selected from a group comprising epoxy resin, polyimide resin, fluorine-based resin and mixtures thereof, and the metal oxide is selected from a group comprising FeO, NiO, CoO, MnO and mixtures thereof. It is additionally desirable for the resin to be selected from a group comprising epoxy resin, polyimide resin and mixtures thereof, and for the metal oxide to be selected from a group comprising FeO, NiO, CoO, MnO and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the amount of introduced component containing metal element in the non-charging resin composite material, as described above, is such that the ratio of the surface resistance of said resin composite material to the resistivity of said component containing metal element is within a certain range, preferably 10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>(1/&square;&middot;cm), with 10<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>(1/&square;&middot;cm) being preferred. Thus, the weight of the component containing metal elements present at the surface of the resin composite material varies in accordance with the resistivity of said component containing metal element. For example, when the component containing metal element is copper, the amount is preferably 0.005-5 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>of surface area, with 0.01-0.3 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>of surface area being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The component containing metal element that is introduced into the resin base in the non-charging resin composite material of the present invention can be present on the base in any form, provided that it exhibits non-charging properties. For example, the component containing metal element can be present in isolated regions on the base surface as fine particles, or can be present as a coating or network structure, as well as combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The distribution and grain diameter of the grains when the material has a particulate form can be determined appropriately in accordance with various configurations such as the thickness of the coating when a coating is formed, or the conductivity of the component containing metal element that is introduced. The introduction mode for the component containing metal element can be modulated in accordance with changing factors regarding the following processes (1)-(3) of the method for manufacturing said non-charging resin composite material: (1) treating the resin base with ion exchange group introduction agent, (2) treating the resin base with liquid containing metal ions, and (3) introducing a component containing metal element at the resin surface by means of a conversion treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The component containing metal element introduced onto the resin base in the non-charging resin composite material of the present invention has a more uniform distribution in comparison to cases wherein material is introduced by conventional electroless plating, and also has superior binding with respect to the base resin. When the component containing metal element is to be formed as a coating, the film thickness of the formed coating is more uniform than with films obtained by conventional methods. Although a theoretical grasp of the problem cannot be expected, it is thought that the improvement in binding of component containing metal element and the uniformity of the distribution and film thickness in the resin composite material of the present invention are due to the uniform introduction, at the molecular level, of conductive regions of metal ions deriving from the component containing metal element on the resin base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The resin composite material pertaining to the present invention described above can be manufactured by a method that comprises 1) treating the resin base with ion exchange group introduction agent, 2) treating the resin base with liquid containing metal ions, and 3) treating the surface of the resin to form component containing metal elements on the surface of the resin. These various processes are described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Process (1). In the method for forming the resin composite material of the present invention, the resin base is first treated with an ion exchange group introduction agent. By means of this ion exchange group introduction agent treatment, groups having ion exchange capacity are introduced. In the present invention, the groups having ion exchange capacity that are introduced into the resin are thought to undergo ion exchange in process (2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The ion exchange group introduction agent treatment of process (1) is carried out by bringing ion exchange group introduction agent into contact with resin base. The contact method, time and contact temperature are adjusted appropriately so that conditions obtain whereby the desired amount of groups having ion exchange capacity are introduced into the resin base, and the resin base is not damaged. In terms of the contact method, immersion can be cited as an example, but methods are not restricted to this one. In process (1) pertaining to the present invention, treatment with ion exchange group introduction agent treatment is carried out. Said treatment can be carried out once, or multiple treatments can be carried out using the same or different introduction agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The ion exchange group introduction agent pertaining to the present invention includes any agent that can introduce groups having ion exchange capacity into base resin. Although Lewis acids or Lewis bases are cited as preferred, substances are not restricted to these. Preferred ion exchange group introduction agents are sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide, chlorosulfuric acid, sulfuryl chloride and other sulfonation agents; hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, formic acid, citric acid, lactic acid and other acids; sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia and other alkalis; and in addition, amination agents, nitration agents, cyanation agents, and oxidation agents. Additionally desirable substances are sulfuric acid, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. The groups having ion exchange capacity that are introduced by said ion exchange group introduction agent treatment can be cation exchange groups or anion exchange groups. Examples include carboxyl groups, thiocarboxyl groups, dithiocarboxyl groups, sulfo groups (sulfonic acid groups), sulfino groups, sulfeno groups, haloformyl groups, carbamoyl groups, hydrazinocarbonyl groups, amidino groups, cyano groups, nitrilo groups, isocyan groups, cyanato groups, isocyanato groups, thiocyanato groups, isothiacyanato groups, formyl groups, hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, thioformyl groups, thioxo groups, mercapto groups, hydropyroxyl groups, amino groups, imino groups, hydrazino groups, diazo groups, azido groups, nitro groups and nitroso groups, but groups are not restricted to these. It is preferable for the groups having ion exchange capacity to be carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, amino groups, imino groups, cyano groups, nitro groups and sulfo groups. Carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups and sulfo groups are additionally desirable. With cation exchange groups, ion exchange occurs with cationic metal ions in process (2), and with anionic exchange groups, ion exchange occurs with anionic metal ions in process (2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For example, when sulfuric acid is used as the ion exchange group introduction agent, the concentration of introduction agent is generally 5-17.5 M, with a concentration of 15-17 M being preferred. If the concentration is less than 5 M, time will be required for treatment, which is undesirable. On the other hand, if the concentration exceeds 17.5 M, the reaction with respect to non-conductive material will be vigorous, and the material structure will be greatly modified, which is undesirable. The treatment temperature is generally 20-90&deg; C., with 40-70&deg; C. being preferred. The treatment time is ordinarily 30 sec to 30 min, with 2 min to 20 min being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In addition, when an alkali solution such as aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide is used as ion exchange group introduction agent, the concentration of the alkali solution is 0.1-10 M, with 1-5 M being preferred. If this concentration is 10 M or greater, the non-conductive substance will be too strongly attacked, and degradation of the non-conductive substance will readily occur. The solvent used for alkali treatment can be water or alcohol. The treatment temperature is 10-80&deg; C., with 25-50&deg; C. being preferred. The treatment time is 30 sec to 10 min, with 2-5 min being preferred. When alcohol is used as solvent, the same effect as when water is used as solvent can be obtained but at a lower alkali concentration, lower temperature and/or shorter time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Process (2): Next, a description will be presented regarding process (2) of the manufacture method for the resin composite material pertaining to the present invention. In process (2) above, the resin base that has been treated with ion exchange group introduction agent in process (1) above is treated with liquid containing metal ions. Metal ions are introduced into the resin base surface by means of this treatment. It is thought that the groups having ion exchange capacity that have been introduced in the resin base surface in process (1) undergo an ion exchange reaction with the metal ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A solution in which the metal element that constitutes the component containing the target metal element is present as metal ions may be used for the liquid containing metal ions. For example, when a metal is to be formed, a solution that contains the desired metal ions is sufficient, and when an alloy is formed, a solution can be used that contains the metal ions of all or some of the metal components that constitute the alloy. For alloys, when a solution is used that contains the metal ions of some of the metal components that constitute the alloy in process (2), it is possible to convert the material to the desired alloy by subsequent treatment with a solution containing the other metal components in process (3). In addition, when a component containing metal compound such as metal oxide or metal sulfide is to be formed, a solution that contains the metal ions of the metal component contained in said metal compound may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The metal ions may be complex ions in solution, and in such a case, the complex ions can be any complex anion or complex cation. The liquid containing metal ions is generally used as an aqueous solution. However, depending on the metal ions that are used, the medium can be methanol or other organic solvent, or an organic mixed solvent medium composed of water and organic medium. As necessary, stabilizer for maintaining pH or complexing agent for preventing sedimentation of metal ions can also be blended in the liquid containing metal ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The metal element ions cited above can be cited as metal ions contained in the liquid containing metal ions used in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In general, the metal ions are blended in the liquid containing metal ions in the form of metal compound or metal salt. There are no particular restrictions on the type of metal salt or metal compound that is used, and an appropriate soluble metal compound or metal salt can be used in accordance with the type of metal. Appropriate examples that can be cited include formate, acetate, chloroacetate, oxalate and other carboxylates, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, nitrite, bicarbonate, hydroxide, phosphate, phosphite, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate, selenate, thiocyanate, tetrafluoroborate, trisethylenediamine chloride, cyanide, chlorate, perchlorate, formate, perbromate, iodate and periodate. Preferred substances are sulfate, chloride and nitrate, with sulfate being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The appropriate concentration of metal ion in the liquid containing metal ions is ordinarily about 0.01-1 mol/L, with about 0.03-0.1 mol/L being preferred. In addition, when the component containing the target metal element is in a form whereby multiple metal component are contained in alloys or mixtures of metal compounds, a solution can be used wherein metal ions are contained at molar ratios that correspond to the molar ratios in the metal component of the final molding. In this case, the total concentration of these multiple metal ions should be such that the aforementioned ranges are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The method for treating the resin base with solution containing metal ions has no particular restrictions, and ordinarily, it is preferable to immerse the resin base that has been treated with ion exchange group introduction agent in process (1) into the liquid containing metal ions. This treatment is carried out, for example, at a temperature of about 20-80&deg; C., with about 25-60&deg; C. being preferred, and for a period of about 1-10 min, with about 3-5 min being preferred. In addition, after treating the resin base with liquid containing metal ions, the material can be washed with water as necessary and subjected to drying or other treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In process (3) that is carried out after treatment with liquid containing metal ions, the pH of the liquid containing metal ions decreases. In order to replenish the liquid with hydroxide ions, the pH of the liquid containing metal ions is appropriately adjusted to a weakly acidic to neutral range, and specifically, a pH of about 2-6, with about 3-4 being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Process (3): Process (3) of the manufacture method for the resin composite material pertaining to the present invention will now be discussed. In process (3), component containing metal element is formed a the surface of the resin base in a conversion process performed on the metal ions that have been introduced in process (2) described above. The term &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; in the invention of this application refers to a binding condition that is different from the original condition due to a change in binding state of the metal element. It is necessary for the component containing metal element to be formed by means of conversion in the invention of this application, and conversion in which component containing metal elements is not formed is not included in the term &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; pertaining to the present invention. The metal ion conversion treatment can be carried out in accordance with the type of component containing metal elements that is the final objective. For example, the conversion treatment in process (3) is a reduction treatment when the component containing metal elements is a metal component, and treatment is carried out with solution containing sulfide for a metal sulfide component; and treatment is carried out with solution containing hydroxide for a metal hydroxide component. However, examples are not restricted to these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the metal ion conversion treatment is a reduction treatment, the reduction treatment method has no particular restrictions, and any method can be used that involves metal formation via the reduction of metal ions introduced onto the resin base surface by means of the treatment of process (2). Ordinarily, a method can be used wherein the resin base that has been treated in process (2) is immersed in solution containing reducing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> There are no particular restrictions on the reducing agent used in reduction of the metal ions that have been introduced at the resin base surface, provided that the substance can cause the deposition of metal via the reduction of said metal ions. Ordinarily, the solution containing reducing agent can be used in the form of an aqueous solution. Examples of reducing agents used in this case that can be cited include sodium borohydride, dimethylaminoborane (DMAB), trimethylaminoborane (TMAB), hydrazine, formaldehyde and derivatives of these various compounds, sodium sulfite and other sulfites, and sodium hypophosphate and other hypophosphites. Any conventional reducing agent can be used, however, and substances are not restricted to these. The concentration of reducing agent in the aqueous solution is ordinarily about 0.0025-3 mol/L, with about 0.01-1.5 mol/L being preferred. The reducing temperature is ordinarily about 20-90&deg; C., with about 25-80&deg; C. being preferred, and the treatment time is about 1-10 min, with about 3-5 min being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Substances that can be used as reducing agents are selenium urea, arsenite, antimony (III) chloride and tellurium chloride, and when these reducing agents are used in the reduction of metal ions that have adsorbed chemically to the acidic groups, the metal component in the reducing agent, specifically, Se when selenium urea is used, As when arsenite is used, Sb when antimony (III) chloride is used, or Te when tellurium chloride is used, is reduced to form a metal component and metal compound. The conditions of use of reducing agent such as selenium urea and arsenite can be the same as when the above various reducing agents are used, and these can be used in conjunction with the aforementioned various reducing agents. In particular, when selenium urea is used in conjunction with other reducing agents, the stability of selenium urea in the reducing agent solution can be improved. Using selenium urea in conjunction with other reducing agents is thus preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> With the reduction treatment carried out using the aqueous solution containing the aforementioned reducing agent, when sufficient metallization is difficult, a reducing treatment can be carried out using organic solvent solution containing reducing agent with stronger reducing capacity. Examples of reducing agents that can be used with organic solvents include metallic Li, Na and K (solvent: liquid ammonia, amines, etc.), trialkylaluminum (solvent: dioxane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, etc.) and tri-n-butyltin and other tin hydride compounds (solvent: ethylene-based solvent, benzene, toluene, etc.). When the reducing treatment is carried out using organic solvent solutions of these reducing agents, it is desirable to determine the reducing agent concentration and reduction conditions appropriately in order to perform sufficient metallization in accordance with the type of metal salts that are to be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The reduction treatment can be carried out by irradiating the resin base having introduced metal ions with electromagnetic radiation. The reduction treatment carried out by electromagnetic radiation is a process in which electromagnetic excitation energy is utilized for the reduction reaction so that the metal is deposited from the metal ions that have been introduced. Any type of electromagnetic energy can be used for the electromagnetic radiation used for the reduction treatment, provided that it has excitation energy that can bring about the reduction of metal ions. However, ultraviolet radiation is preferred. The power of the electromagnetic radiation can be between 10 W and 10 kW, but in order to reduce treatment time, 100 W to 1 kW is preferred. The electromagnetic radiation irradiation time is 30 sec to 1 h, with 1 min to 10 min being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As necessary, irradiation with ultraviolet radiation can be carried out after mounting a glass mask. When a glass mask is mounted, the metal ions can be selectively reduced in only the desired regions. Any type of mask can used, provided that it does not allow passage of ultraviolet radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When a metal sulfide component is to be formed, the resin base that has been treated with liquid containing metal ions in process (2) is treated with solution containing sulfide. The sulfide that is contained in the solution containing sulfide used for the treatment has no particular restrictions, provided that it is a substance that generates sulfide ions in solution. Examples of this type of sulfide that can be cited include sodium sulfide, potassium sulfide, and ammonium sulfide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The amount of sulfide in the solution containing sulfide is generally about 0.051-1.2 mol/L, with about 0.1-0.5 mol/L being preferred. If the sulfide concentration is less than 0.05 mol/L, it will be difficult to bring about sufficient deposition of metal sulfide, whereas if this amount exceeds 1.2 mol/L, the improvement in effect will not keep pace with the increase in concentration, which is undesirable from an economic standpoint. The solution containing sulfide can be an aqueous solution, organic solvent solution or a mixed solution of water and organic solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The pH of the solution containing sulfide can be weakly acidic to alkaline, and it is preferable to adjust the value to a pH of about 4-11, with about 6-10 being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Treatment with the solution containing sulfide can be carried out by a method in which the resin base containing metal ions introduced in process (2) is immersed in solution containing sulfide. The treatment temperature is generally about 20-80&deg; C., with about 25-60&deg; C. being preferred. If the treatment temperature is less than 20&deg; C., then formation of the metal sulfide will tend to be insufficient, whereas if this temperature exceeds 80&deg; C., the solution will become unstable, which is undesirable. The treatment time is ordinarily about 2-30 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> When a metal hydroxide component is to be formed, the resin base that has been treated with the liquid containing metal ions in process (2) is treated with solution containing hydroxide, and subsequently, a thermal treatment is carried out in order to form the metal hydroxide component on said resin base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> This treatment process can be carried out using any desired compound, provided that it is a compound that can form hydroxide ions in solution. Examples of this type of hydroxide include NaOH, NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH and KOH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The concentration of hydroxide in the liquid containing hydroxide is generally about 0.025-12 mol/L, with about 0.1-5 mol/L being preferred. If the concentration of hydroxide compound is too low, then sufficient hydroxide will not be formed, whereas if the hydroxide concentration is too high, there will be undesirable cases in which the resin is degraded. The solution containing hydroxide can be an aqueous solution, organic solvent or mixed solution composed of water and organic solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The treatment carried out with solution containing hydroxide is ordinarily carried out by a method in which the resin base containing metal ions introduced in process (2) is immersed in solution containing hydroxide. The treatment temperature is generally about 10-80&deg; C., with about 20-50&deg; C. being preferred. If the treatment temperature is too low, formation of metal hydroxide will tend to be insufficient, whereas if the treatment temperature is to high, there will be undesirable cases in which the resin is degraded. The treatment time is ordinarily about 2-30 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> By treatment with solution containing hydroxide in this manner, a metal hydroxide layer is formed at the surface of the resin base, and by subsequent heat treatment and dehydration, metal oxide component is formed on said resin base. The thermal treatment method is related to the heat resistance of the resin, but a high temperature is preferably used in a range at which the resin does not degrade. For example, with epoxy resin system resin bases, heating at about 80-150&deg; C. is preferred, and with polyimide system resin bases, heating at about 80-180&deg; C. is preferred. The heating time is generally about 30-120&deg; C. The heating atmosphere has no particular restrictions, and the heating treatment can be carried out in air, or when Fe<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is to be formed, heating is preferably carried out in a reducing atmosphere such as a hydrogen atmosphere so that oxidation does not progress too extensively. The appropriate heating atmosphere can be determined in accordance with the characteristics of the target component.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As described above, the resin composite material of the present invention has extremely small amounts of component containing metal element introduced at the surface of a resin base such that charging of the resin base can be prevented without increasing the conductivity intrinsic to the resin base above a certain level, which has been difficult in the past. By this means, said non-charging resin composite material can prevent damage to the base from electrostatic electricity caused by charging, and can prevent detrimental effects such as the adhesion of dirt or dust on the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In addition, the aforementioned non-charging resin composite material provides excellent binding of the component containing metal element present at the surface of the resin base with respect to the base, and thus anti-charging effects can be obtained that are persistent rather than temporary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the useful non-charging resin composite material of the type described above can be readily manufactured by means of employing a simple method whereby the surface of a resin base that has been treated with ion exchange group introduction agent is treated with liquid containing metal ions to introduce metal ions, followed by conversion of said metal ions. </paragraph>
