<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for fabricating a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device using a surface-mounted lead frame in which leads are exposed on the bottom surface of a resin-encapsulated portion (package). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, there is an increasing demand for high-density mounting of semiconductor elements on electronic devices in order to realize smaller electronic devices with higher functionalities. Accordingly, the overall size and the thickness of a semiconductor element such as a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device (a device obtained by integrally encapsulating a semiconductor chip and leads in an encapsulation resin) have been quickly reduced. Therefore, various techniques have been developed for the fabrication of semiconductor elements such as resin-encapsulated semiconductor devices in order to reduce the production cost and to increase the productivity. For example, a molding method has been developed in the art, in which a plurality of semiconductor chips are individually encapsulated in an encapsulation resin after the die bonding step and the wire bonding step. A process of resin encapsulation according to a conventional molding method will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> are perspective views schematically illustrating a resin encapsulation apparatus used in a conventional molding method and a process of resin encapsulation with such an apparatus. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> are cross-sectional views illustrating the inside of an encapsulation mold set during the resin encapsulation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, the resin encapsulation apparatus is capable of holding an encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> under a constant tension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B, a</cross-reference> lead frame <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> carrying a number of semiconductor chips thereon is set on a lower mold <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>, and resin tablets <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight> are placed in encapsulation resin supply sections <highlight><bold>1061</bold></highlight> of the lower mold <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Then, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the lead frame <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is clamped between an upper mold <highlight><bold>1051</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>. At this time, a melted encapsulation resin is supplied by a plunger <highlight><bold>1058</bold></highlight> from below into semiconductor product molding sections <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, whereby a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1055</bold></highlight> is injection-molded in each die cavity. Upon completing the injection molding and opening the lower mold <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>, the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> is separated from a resin cull <highlight><bold>1063</bold></highlight> and the resin-encapsulated semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1055</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional molding method, when the lead frame <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is clamped between the upper mold <highlight><bold>1051</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>, a gas (e.g., an air left therein due to warping of the lead frame <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, etc., a vapor generated from the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> due to a temperature increase, or an organic material gas) may be entrapped in the slight gap between the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and the opposing upper mold <highlight><bold>1051</bold></highlight>. If the lead frame <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is clamped between the upper mold <highlight><bold>1051</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> with such a gas being entrapped, the gas will not be discharged out of the gap between the upper and lower molds. Moreover, subsequent injection of an encapsulation resin into the cavity may push the entrapped gas away from a resin injection gate <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, thereby deforming the lead frame <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> by the pressure of the gas being pushed. An excessive deformation of the lead frame <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> may cause a semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight> and/or a thin metal wire <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> to come into contact with the lower mold <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>, thereby damaging or deforming the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight> and/or the thin metal wire <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in order to solve this problem in the prior art, and has an object to suppress the deformation of a lead frame during the resin encapsulation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A lead frame of the present invention is a lead frame used in resin encapsulation of a semiconductor chip using an encapsulation mold that includes a die cavity to be filled with an encapsulation resin, the lead frame including: a first region exposed to the die cavity; a second region that is surrounding the first region and to be clamped by the encapsulation mold; a third region exposed to an ambient air with the die cavity being filled with the encapsulation resin; and at least one groove formed on a surface of the lead frame that is opposite to another surface of the lead frame on which the first region is present, the at least one groove extending from an area corresponding to the first region across another area corresponding to the second region so as to reach the third region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device is fabricated with a resin creepage preventing member being attached to one surface of the lead frame of the present invention that is opposite to the surface thereof on which the first region is present, the air entrapped between the resin creepage preventing member and the encapsulation mold is pushed into the second region clamped by the encapsulation mold due to the pressure from the resin being injected into the die cavity in the resin encapsulation process. The air being pushed lifts the resin creepage preventing member covering at least one groove toward the lead frame, i.e., into the at least one groove. The at least one groove extends from an area corresponding to the first region across another area corresponding to the second region so as to reach the third region that is exposed to the ambient air, whereby the air lifting the resin creepage preventing member into the at least one groove is discharged to the outside of the encapsulation mold. Therefore, in the fabrication of a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device, it is possible to suppress/prevent the lead frame from being deformed, and to suppress/prevent a damage to semiconductor chips, a deformation and disruption of thin metal wires, etc., which may otherwise occur due to the deformation of the lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The at least one groove may be a U-shaped groove; and the third region may be a side edge of the lead frame surrounding the second region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The at least one groove may be a U-shaped groove that includes a through hole connecting the at least one groove to the third region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A method for fabricating a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device of the present invention includes the steps of: (a) preparing a lead frame, including: a first region; a second region surrounding the first region; a third region located outside the second region; and at least one groove formed on a surface of the lead frame that is opposite to another surface of the lead frame on which the first region is present, the at least one groove extending from an area corresponding to the first region across another area corresponding to the second region so as to reach the third region; (b) providing a resin creepage preventing member on the area corresponding to the first region; (c) mounting a semiconductor chip on the first region of the lead frame; and (d) clamping the second region by an encapsulation mold that includes a die cavity so as to place the semiconductor chip into the die cavity, and filling the die cavity with a resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> With this fabrication method, in the resin filling step, the air entrapped between the resin creepage preventing member and the encapsulation mold is pushed into the second region clamped by the encapsulation mold due to the pressure from the resin being injected into the die cavity. The air being pushed lifts the resin creepage preventing member covering at least one groove toward the lead frame, i.e., into the at least one groove. The at least one groove extends from an area corresponding to the first region across another area corresponding to the second region so as to reach the third region that is located outside the second region and is not clamped by the encapsulation mold, whereby the air lifting the resin creepage preventing member into the at least one groove is discharged to the outside of the encapsulation mold. Therefore, in the fabrication of a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device, it is possible to suppress/prevent the lead frame from being deformed, and to suppress/prevent a damage to semiconductor chips, a deformation and disruption of thin metal wires, etc., which may otherwise occur due to the deformation of the lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the step (a), the at least one groove may be a U-shaped groove; and the third region may be a side edge surrounding the second region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the step (a), the at least one groove may be a U-shaped groove that includes a through hole connecting the at least one groove to the third region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the step (b), the resin creepage preventing member is preferably provided along a surface of the at least one groove. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In this way, the air that has been pushed into the second region clamped by the encapsulation mold in the resin encapsulation process is discharged to the outside of the encapsulation mold, whereby the pressure for lifting the resin creepage preventing member covering the at least one groove toward the lead frame, i.e., into the at least one groove, is not required. Therefore, the air discharging efficiency is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another method for fabricating a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device of the present invention includes the steps of: (a) preparing a lead frame including a first region and a second region surrounding the first region; (b) providing a resin creepage preventing member on an area corresponding to the first region and another area corresponding to the second region, the resin creepage preventing member including at least one U-shaped groove extending from a position corresponding to the first region across the area corresponding to the second region so as to reach a side edge surrounding the second region; (c) mounting a semiconductor chip on the first region of the lead frame; and (d) clamping the second region by an encapsulation mold that includes a die cavity so as to place the semiconductor chip into the die cavity, and filling the die cavity with a resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With this fabrication method, in the resin filling step, the air entrapped between the resin creepage preventing member and the encapsulation mold is pushed into the second region clamped by the encapsulation mold due to the pressure from the resin being injected into the die cavity. The air being pushed is discharged to the outside of the encapsulation mold through at least one groove that is provided in the resin creepage preventing member and extends from an area corresponding to the first region across another area corresponding to the second region so as to reach a side edge that is surrounding the second region and is not clamped by the encapsulation mold. Therefore, in the fabrication of a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device, it is possible to suppress/prevent the lead frame from being deformed, and to suppress/prevent a damage to semiconductor chips, a deformation and disruption of thin metal wires, etc., which may otherwise occur due to the deformation of the lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Still another method for fabricating a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device of the present invention includes the steps of: (a) preparing a lead frame including a first region and a second region surrounding the first region; (b) providing a resin creepage preventing member on an area corresponding to the first region and another area corresponding to the second region, the resin creepage preventing member including a satin finished surface on the area corresponding to the first region and the area corresponding to the second region; (c) mounting a semiconductor chip on the first region; and (d) clamping the second region by an encapsulation mold that includes a die cavity so as to place the semiconductor chip into the die cavity, and filling the die cavity with a resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With this fabrication method, in the resin filling step, the air entrapped between the resin creepage preventing member and the encapsulation mold is moved by the pressure from the resin being injected into the die cavity through spaces between the minute surface irregularities of the satin finished surface of the resin creepage preventing member, and is discharged to the outside of the encapsulation mold before the lead frame is deformed. Therefore, in the fabrication of a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device, it is possible to suppress/prevent the lead frame from being deformed, and to suppress/prevent a damage to semiconductor chips, a deformation and disruption of thin metal wires, etc., which may otherwise occur due to the deformation of the lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Still another method for fabricating a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device of the present invention includes the steps of: (a) preparing a first encapsulation mold including a die cavity and a clamp section and a second encapsulation mold including a surface corresponding to the die cavity and another surface corresponding to the clamp section, the second encapsulation mold including at least one groove extending from an area corresponding to the die cavity across another area corresponding to the clamp section so as to reach still another area surrounding the area corresponding to the clamp section; (b) preparing a lead frame including a first region and a second region surrounding the first region; (c) providing a resin creepage preventing member on an area corresponding to the first region and another area corresponding to the second region; (d) mounting a semiconductor chip on the first region of the lead frame; and (e) clamping the second region by the first encapsulation mold and the second encapsulation mold so as to place the semiconductor chip into the die cavity, and filling the die cavity with a resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With this fabrication method, in the resin filling step, the air entrapped between the resin creepage preventing member and the second encapsulation mold is discharged to the outside of the encapsulation mold, before the lead frame is deformed, through at least one groove that is provided in the second encapsulation mold and extends from an area corresponding to the die cavity across another area corresponding to the clamp section so as to reach still another area surrounding the area corresponding to the clamp section. Therefore, in the fabrication of a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device, it is possible to suppress/prevent the lead frame from being deformed, and to suppress/prevent a damage to semiconductor chips, a deformation and disruption of thin metal wires, etc., which may otherwise occur due to the deformation of the lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Still another method for fabricating a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device of the present invention includes the steps of: preparing a first encapsulation mold including a die cavity and a clamp section and a second encapsulation mold including a surface corresponding to the die cavity and another surface corresponding to the clamp section, the surface corresponding to the die cavity and the surface corresponding to the clamp section being satin finished; (b) preparing a lead frame including a first region and a second region surrounding the first region; (c) providing a resin creepage preventing member on an area corresponding to the first region and another area corresponding to the second region; (d) mounting a semiconductor chip on the first region of the lead frame; and (e) clamping the second region by the first encapsulation mold and the second encapsulation mold so as to place the semiconductor chip into the die cavity, and filling the die cavity with a resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With this fabrication method, in the resin filling step, the air entrapped between the resin creepage preventing member and the encapsulation mold is moved by the pressure from the resin being injected into the die cavity through spaces between the minute surface irregularities of the satin finished surface of the second encapsulation mold, and is discharged to the outside of the encapsulation mold before the lead frame is deformed. Therefore, in the fabrication of a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device, it is possible to suppress/prevent the lead frame from being deformed, and to suppress/prevent a damage to semiconductor chips, a deformation and disruption of thin metal wires, etc., which may otherwise occur due to the deformation of the lead frame.</paragraph>

The term &ldquo;encapsulation tape/lead frame&rdquo; as used herein refers to a lead frame with an encapsulation tape adhered thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment includes a lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A and an encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> adhered thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A includes, in its central area, a semiconductor device formation region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in which a plurality of semiconductor chips are to be resin-encapsulated in a single process. The periphery of the semiconductor device formation region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to and supported by an outer frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. An area in the outer frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that is defined within a mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an area to be encapsulated by an encapsulation resin in a single process, and an area outside the mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an area to be clamped by the mold set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A includes a plurality of U-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (the term &ldquo;U-shaped groove&rdquo; as used herein refers to a groove having a bottom surface, as opposed to a through hole having no bottom surface) each extending transversely across the mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from a position inside the mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> toward a side edge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached across the entirety of one surface (bottom surface) of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A that is opposite to the semiconductor chip holding surface thereof. The encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided so as to prevent an encapsulation resin from creeping onto the bottom surface side of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A in the resin encapsulation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A method for fabricating a semiconductor device of the present embodiment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> First, the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached across the entirety of the bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. In the present embodiment, leads are exposed on one surface (bottom surface) of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A opposite to the surface thereof holding semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (i.e., the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A is of a surface-mounted type). Therefore, the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached across the entirety of the bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A so as to prevent an encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from creeping onto the bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. While the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached across the entirety of the bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A in the present embodiment, the manner in which the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached is not limited thereto as long as it covers at least the area defined within the mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The attachment of the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be done at any timing before the subsequent resin encapsulation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Then, in a die bonding step, the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are fixed to respective die pads (not shown) of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A via a solder, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Then, in a wire bonding step, each semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to leads (not shown) of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A via thin metal wires <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> made of gold (Au), for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Then, a resin encapsulation process is performed so as to produce a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device by injection molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The resin encapsulation step of the present embodiment will now be described in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device fabrication apparatus used in the resin encapsulation step of the present embodiment includes an upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a pot section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for introducing an encapsulation resin therethrough, and a plunger <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that can be moved up and down in the pot section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes a cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> (defined by a depressed portion of the upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>) that is used for resin-encapsulating the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fixed to the single encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a single process and that dictates the shape of the molded product. The upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> further includes a runner <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a gate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> via which the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is supplied into the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and an air vent <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for discharging the air from the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> out of the mold set. The air vent <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is provided at one end that is opposite to the gate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> with respect to the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the resin encapsulation step is performed as follows. First, the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> fixed thereto is set on the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that the bottom surface of the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> carrying the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> attached thereto faces the upper surface of the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Then, the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is clamped between the upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In this process, it is difficult to bring the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> into a perfect contact with the upper surface of the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> while maintaining the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a completely flat configuration. It is often the case that an air is entrapped in the slight gap between the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Then, the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which has been heated and thus given a flowability, is injected into the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> by the plunger <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, thereby encapsulating the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a single process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, when the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is injected into the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the air entrapped in the slight gap between the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is moved toward the air vent <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by the pressure from the injection of the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As the injection of the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> proceeds, the air entrapped between the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is discharged to the outside while lifting, by virtue of its own pressure, the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> covering the grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> toward the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A (i.e., into the grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this way, it is possible to prevent the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A from being deformed, and to suppress/prevent a damage to the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a deformation and disruption of the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, etc., which may otherwise occur due to the deformation of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. Thus, it is possible to obtain a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device with a high yield, and to reduce the fabrication cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Each of the grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> needs to be formed on the bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A so as to extend at least from a position inside the mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> across the peripheral portion that is clamped by the mold set to reach an area that is exposed to the ambient air. Particularly, when the outer frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> located outside the mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is entirely clamped between the upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the air discharging effect is obtained by forming the grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to reach the side edge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. While the grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are U-shaped grooves having a bottom surface in the present embodiment, effects as those described above can also be obtained by employing cut-through grooves (the term &ldquo;cut-through groove&rdquo; as used herein refers to a through hole having no bottom surface). Alternatively, the grooves <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may each be partially cut through and partially U-shaped with the U-shaped portion being located in the clamped area, in which case it is possible to prevent the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from leaking out from the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> through the groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the encapsulation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be attached to the bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A so that the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is bent into a concave shape along each groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provided on the bottom surface. In this way, when the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is injected into the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the air can be discharged without lifting the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> toward the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. Therefore, it is possible to more efficiently prevent the deformation of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>

One end of each U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is closer to the side edge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B is connected to a through hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached to one surface (bottom surface) of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B that is opposite to the semiconductor chip holding surface thereof.

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the step of attaching the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B is performed so that the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> covers an area of the bottom surface that is defined within the mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while exposing at least a portion of each through hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>.

Moreover, the attachment of the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be done at any timing before the subsequent resin encapsulation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Then, a resin encapsulation process is performed so as to produce a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device by injection molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The resin encapsulation step of the present embodiment will now be described in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device fabrication apparatus used in the resin encapsulation step of the present embodiment includes an upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A and a lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The air vent <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is provided at one end that is opposite to the gate <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> with respect to the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Particularly, in the present embodiment, the air vent <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is provided in an area where the through hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is located upon setting the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the mold set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the resin encapsulation step is performed as follows.

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Then, the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is clamped between the upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A and the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A. In this process, as in Embodiment 1 above, it is difficult to bring the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into a perfect contact with the upper surface of the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A while maintaining the encapsulation tape/lead frame <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in a completely flat configuration. It is often the case that an air is entrapped in the slight gap between the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the upper surface of the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Then, the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which has been heated and thus given a flowability, is injected into the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> by the plunger <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, thereby encapsulating the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a single process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, when the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is injected into the cavity <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the air entrapped in the slight gap between the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A is moved toward the air vent <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> by the pressure from the injection of the encapsulation resin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>.

The air further passes through the through hole <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and is then discharged through the air vent <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the upper mold <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>A that is not involved in clamping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> According to the present embodiment, it is possible to prevent the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B from being deformed, and to suppress/prevent a damage to the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a deformation and disruption of the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, etc., which may otherwise occur due to the deformation of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B. Thus, it is possible to obtain a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device with a high yield, and to reduce the fabrication cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Thus, the configuration of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B of the present embodiment is suitable for cases where the lower mold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>A having a configuration such that the mold set encloses therein the side edge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, is used. In such cases, in order to maximize the air discharging effect, it is preferred that the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is attached to the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B so as to cover at least an area of the outer frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> including the mold line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while exposing the entirety of the through holes <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be attached to the bottom surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B so that the encapsulation tape <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is bent into a concave shape along each groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provided on the bottom surface.
