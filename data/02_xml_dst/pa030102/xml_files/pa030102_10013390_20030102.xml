<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of forming a photo-catalytic film made of titanium oxide which has photo-catalytic activities such as anti-bacteria, anti-pollution, air-cleaning, or hyper hydrophilic property, on a base material and a laminated material including a base on which a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide is formed. More particularly, it relates to a laminated material including a flexible transparent base on which a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The photo-catalytic activity, the photo-catalyst possessing photo-voltaic force, and the optical semiconductor are a recent focus of attention for their extraordinary application. For example, titanium oxide, which is a photo-catalyst (optical semiconductor), is reported to decompose by oxidation organic stains stuck on a material surface, nitrogen oxides (NO<highlight><subscript>X</subscript></highlight>), sulfur oxides (SO<highlight><subscript>X</subscript></highlight>), air-contaminating substances such as odor sources or bacteria, depending on its oxidizing power based on the photo-catalytic activity. The known embodiments include a method of removing air-contaminating substances with sunlight based on a photo-catalytic catalyst of titanium oxide that is pasted on a building wall (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 06-315614), a method of sterilizing bacteria based on a titanium oxide catalyst that is pasted on a wall or a handrail in a hospital (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 07-102678), a method of decomposing stains in wastewater based on a titanium oxide catalyst dispersed in the wastewater under the irradiation of light from a UV lamp (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 05-92192), a method of applying the self-cleaning action of a photo-catalyst to simplifying the maintenance of a fluorescent lamp or a lighting appliance (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 09-129012), and many other applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is reported that the surface of photo-catalytic film becomes highly hydrophilic due to the photo-catalytic reaction. Its application has been widely investigated for prevention of clouding in mirrors (of bathroom or automobile), lenses or windows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Further, the self-cleaning action of the photo-catalytic coating is well known. In more detail, the photo-catalytic coating formed on building walls, automobile glass, or house windows works to prevent sticking of hydrophobic stains due to its hydrophilic property on the processed surface. Even when some stains are stuck, they are easily decomposed. The hydrophilic property of the coating effects to wash out easily these stains and their decomposition products by rain or water flushing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The photo-catalytic coating of titanium oxide may be obtained by various production methods. They include a method of applying a hydrolysis product of titanium compounds such as titanium alkoxide or titanium acetate on a base material followed by drying and sintering at more than 500&deg; C. to yield a coating of anatase-type titanium oxide, a method of forming amorphous titanium oxide coating on a base by the deposition method followed by annealing at more than 400&deg; C. to yield a coating containing anatase-type titanium oxide, a method of oxidizing a surface of metallic titanium at more than 500&deg; C. and inducing crystallization, and a method of employing the RF sputtering, which is applied on a base material heated at more than 250&deg; C. to yield a coating of anatase-type titanium oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Among these methods, the calcination of a coating of amorphous titanium oxide for the photo-catalytic coating requires heating of the base material at a very high temperature for a long time, which leads economically to a high cost. In addition, formation of a photo-catalytic coating on a plastic resin base is practically impossible in view of the heat resistance of the plastic resin base. The RF sputtering method is an excellent technique for production of anatase-type titanium oxide that yields a large photocurrent. But it requires an expensive production apparatus and is difficult to produce photo-catalytic coating at a low cost. Although some plastic base materials endure the high temperature of 250&deg; C., there is no plastic base materials that is equipped with excellent light transmission, heat resistance above 250&deg; C., and reasonable production cost simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The photo-catalytic coating has lately attracted considerable attention for its photo-voltaic force as well as novel characteristics such as anti-pollution, anti-bacteria, and anti-clouding based on the photochemical reaction on the surface. When a base equipped with a conductive film and a photo-catalytic film is immersed in an aqueous solution or an electrolytic solution under UV light applied on the photo-catalytic film, the photo-voltaic force is generated on the irradiated section. Selective formation of a photo-catalytic film becomes possible using the phenomenon. In more detail, when the above-mentioned base is immersed in an electro-depositing solution containing electro-deposition substances that induce film formation, with or without a bias voltage applied between the conductive film and an opposed electrode, under irradiation on the photo-catalytic film with UV light, the photo-voltaic force is generated on the irradiated section resulting in the electro-deposition of film forming substances on the section. In the case of sufficiently high photo-voltaic force for the photo-catalytic film, the bias voltage may be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present invention have previously applied for a method of forming extra-fine patterns with excellent resolution using the above-mentioned photo-voltaic force, which may be useful for production of color filters and the like (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application Nos. Hei 11-74790, Hei 11-133224, and Hei 11-335894). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> With regard to the method of forming semiconductor film on a plastic resin base, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 06-11738 describes formation of a crystalline semiconductor film of silicon for an MIM apparatus, in which a film surface of insulating base compound made of silicon is irradiated with energy beam such as laser beam causing meltdown of the surface and converting the surface layer into a film of crystalline silicon. Under the surface layer the insulating base compound layer remains unchanged. Also, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 05-315361 describes formation of a semiconductor film on a plastic film, in which a film of non-crystalline substance and an insulating film of metal oxide are formed on a plastic film in this order, followed by application of laser beam on the side of the insulating film causing meltdown of the film of non-crystalline substance near the interface between the non-crystalline film and the insulating film for subsequent crystallization. This method yields a crystalline semiconductor film without giving thermal damages on the plastic film due to laser beam. Further, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 05-326402 describes a similar method, in which a heat barrier film and then a film of amorphous silicon are formed on a plastic film to eliminate the thermal effect by laser beam, followed by application of laser beam to induce formation of a polycrystalline silicon film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> All these methods are dependent on crystallization of amorphous semiconductor film by annealing with laser beam. In order to eliminate the thermal effect by laser beam (it sometimes reaches 1,000&deg; C.) on the plastic film, one method employs meltdown of only the surface layer of the amorphous semiconductor film, and the other opts for additional formation of a heat barrier layer. With these methods it is impossible to induce crystallization of the whole amorphous film, requiring an additional process providing of a heat barrier layer as well as an expensive laser beam irradiation apparatus. In addition, it becomes difficult to obtain a large-sized film, as the whole surface of the film has to be scanned with the spot of laser beam. They are also disadvantageous because the total crystallization needs much time for completion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2000-68520 describes application of UV laser beam of a short wavelength (excimer laser beam) to convert a film of amorphous silicon into semiconductor film of crystalline silicon. This method does not give much thermal effect on the base material, yet the temperature of the base material reaches around 600&deg; C. For this reason only glass bases are employed in the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The production method of photo-catalytic film made of titanium oxide according to the present invention is characterized by the application of UV light on the film at rather low temperatures. Compared with a previous method where the film of titanium oxide is irradiated with laser beam at high temperatures around 1,000&deg; C. for obtaining film of crystalline titanium oxide by annealing, this method is applicable at very low temperatures for the annealing. In addition, scanning of a laser beam spot is not necessary in this method, and only application of UV light on the whole surface of a film using UV light irradiation apparatus is needed. For the reason, it is possible to produce a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide in a shorter time without a large-scale treatment apparatus compared with the existing methods. As a result, the production cost can be substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> While in the existing methods a complicated process or an apparatus is needed in order to form a photo-catalytic film on a plastic resin base as described in the above, the present invention allows to form a photo-catalytic film on a plastic base material with a simple process or an apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Also in a complicated process according to the existing methods for applying anti-clouding, anti-pollution, or hydrophilic treatment on a mirror or a glass surface, an amorphous photo-catalytic film is first to be formed on the surface followed by sintering at more than 400&deg; C. In contrast, the method according to the present invention allows easy production of a photo-catalytic film on a plastic base material. Pasting such a processed base on a surface that needs anti-clouding, anti-pollution or hydrophilic property leads most simply to the wanted properties of the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Concerning the base material used in the present invention, limitlessly employed are glass base materials; base materials made of plastic resins in the form of film, sheet, or plate; ceramic base materials such as ceramic sheet or ceramic plate; and mono-crystalline bases made of Si, GaN, GaAs, or GaP. As the base materials of plastic, listed are films, sheets, or plates of polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polyetherether-ketone, polyether-sulfone, polysulfone, polyether-imide, polyetherketone, polyphenylene-sulfide, polyarylate, polyimide, polycarbonate, and norbornene resin (trade name; ARTON by JSR). These plastic base materials should preferably have a flexible character. Among these resins norbornene resin is a recent focus of attention as an excellent heat resistant resin having superior transmissivity of light in a wide range of spectrum (Chemical Business Journal, December 1997 extra edition). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When the base processed of photo-catalytic film according to the present invention is employed practically for the anti-clouding or anti-pollution of substances that have a property of light reflection or light transmission, the base material should also have a light-transmitting property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Since a rather high heating temperature is favored for the film of titanium oxide to yield a film having an excellent photo-catalytic effect, adoption of highly heat resistant plastic base materials is preferable when plastic base materials are used. Typical heat resistant plastic base materials include polyimide (heat resistant temperature of 331&deg; C.), polycarbonate (PC: heat resistant temperature of 205&deg; C.), polyether-sulfone (PES: heat resistant temperature of 223&deg; C.), polysulfone (PS: heat resistant temperature of 190&deg; C.), and norbornene resin (ARTON: heat resistant temperature of 171&deg; C.). Particularly the heat resistant type PC and PES are favored because of their high transparency, heat resistance around 220&deg; C., and less optical anisotropy. In the present invention, the heat resistant temperature of the plastic base material is a glass transition point, which is 10 to 230&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> When plastic resins are employed as the base, the thickness should be preferably 30 to 300 &mgr;m, more preferably 80 to 230 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The property &ldquo;amorphous&rdquo; described in the present invention means not only the film of completely amorphous titanium oxide, but also a mixture film of amorphous and crystalline titanium oxide. Processing according to the present invention on a film of titanium oxide that contains only a trace of amorphous section has proved to enhance the photo-catalytic effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Concerning the formation method of film of amorphous titanium oxide in the present invention, there are the sputtering method, the RF sputtering method, the EB deposition method, and the ion plating method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the case where a film of amorphous titanium oxide is formed on a plastic base material, many transparent plastics having comparatively low heat resistance (below 230&deg; C.) may be used. The sputtering method and the RF sputtering method are favored for the film formation because they give damages less to the base material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The heating temperature for film of amorphous titanium oxide in the present invention is preferably above 25&deg; C., more preferably above 50&deg; C., which suffices for converting the amorphous state into a crystalline or polycrystalline state yielding a film of titanium oxide that has an excellent photo-catalytic effect. Higher heating temperatures are favored in order to raise the crystallinity of titanium oxide. There are no particular limitations on the upper limit temperature of heating, but it is preferably approximately 300&deg; C., more preferably approximately 250&deg; C. in view of the selected heating method, control of the heating temperature, and the resulting energy loss. In order to raise the crystallinity effectively and determine the heating condition to an adequate value, the film of amorphous titanium oxide is heated preferably at a temperature between approximately 100 and 1200&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When a plastic base material is employed for the base material, the upper limit on the heating is equal to the heat resistant temperature of the plastic base material. Concerning the listed plastic base materials, it is 230&deg; C. at most. From the above-mentioned requirement, the heating temperature for the plastic base material is preferably between approximately 100 and 200&deg; C. (in the case the heat resistant temperature of employed plastic base material is 200&deg; C. or lower, the upper limit is the heat resistant temperature). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The application of UV light can be satisfactorily performed with commercially available UV light irradiation apparatuses. Among them the excimer lamp is preferably employed. As a shorter wavelength of UV light has higher energy, the wavelength below 365 nm, preferably below 308 nm, is employed in the present invention (for example, UV light of 308 nm, 202 nm, and 172 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> An irradiation amount of 1 to 50 mW/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is sufficient for converting a film of titanium oxide into a photo-catalytic film. The longer the irradiation time of UV light is prolonged, the more effectively the conversion is carried out from a film of titanium oxide into a photo-catalytic film. For example, heating time of 10 to 30 minutes is adequate for the conversion at 150&deg; C., although the heating time depends on the heating temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As for the atmosphere in which the heating and the UV light irradiation are performed, vacuum or atmosphere of gases is preferred, more particularly an atmosphere having low partial pressure of oxygen is favored. Lower partial pressures of oxygen help to lower the heating temperature of film of titanium oxide. In the present invention, the &ldquo;vacuum&rdquo; is generally defined as a degree of vacuum below approximately 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>Pa. It can be determined adequately depending on other conditions. With regard to the atmosphere of gases, one or more species selected from a group including hydrogen gas, nitrogen gas, ammonia gas, rare gases such as He, Ne, or Ar, or carbon monoxide gas are preferably used. Particularly the reducing atmosphere containing hydrogen gas is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In an example, the annealing process is conducted under a reducing atmosphere of purified nitrogen gas with 2 to 5% (below the explosion limit) hydrogen gas (with a flow rate of 0.5 to 2 L/min on a 1-liter apparatus). The treated film of titanium oxide is converted from the amorphous state to a polycrystalline state while, in the process, lattice defects are generated to increase the concentration of electron carriers, which also improves the photoelectric characteristics significantly. The pressure of the reducing atmosphere may be the ordinary pressure (atmospheric pressure) or a reduced pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the formation of photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide according to the present invention, a base material having good transmission of light yields a laminated material of good light transmission. In the process, either formation of an anti-reflection film between the base material of good light transmission and the film of titanium oxide, or limitation of the optical thickness for the film of titanium oxide to a specific value, enables to suppress reflection of light between the base material having good transmission of light and the film of titanium oxide, yielding a laminated material having excellent light transmissivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the anti-reflection film is a mono-layer, the following condition is preferred in order to eliminate the above reflection of light. The refractive index of the mono-layer is a figure between the refractive index of the base material, and the optical thickness of the photo-catalytic film, which is defined as the product of the refractive index by the film thickness, corresponds to one-fourth or its integer multiples of the wavelength of a specific employed light that is near the center of the visible region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The refractive index of the anti-reflection film is preferably set between 1.5 and 2.3, and its thickness is preferably between approximately 50 nm and 100 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When the anti-reflection film is a multi-layer, the following condition is preferred in order to prevent the above reflection of light effectively and improving the transmission. The refractive index figures for respective films range between the refractive index of the light-transmitting base material and the refractive index of the photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide, and the optical thickness values of the respective anti-reflection film, which are defined as the product of the respective refractive index of each film by the thickness, correspond to one-fourth or its integer multiples of the wavelength of light that is near the center of the visible region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The above anti-reflection film may be made from metal oxide dielectrics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Examples of metal oxide dielectrics for the anti-reflection film include ITO, CeF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, ZnS, MgO, Gd<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Sc<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SiO, HfO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and CeO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Particularly ZrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is widely employed for a material of dielectric film having high refractive index. The anti-reflection film made of metal oxide dielectrics can be easily formed depending on the sputtering method, the RF sputtering method, and the EB beam deposition method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> When a visible light having the central wavelength 550 nm is employed with a glass base material having a refractive index of 1.5 and a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide having a refractive index of 2.5, it is effective to employ a material having a refractive index of 1.8 to 2.0 for the anti-reflection film. To be more precise, a film of ZrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>that has a refractive index of 2.0 with the thickness of 69 nm (550/(4&times;2.0)) or its integer multiples is preferred. In the case of ITO having a refractive index of 1.9, it is effective to adjust the film thickness to 72 nm (550/(4&times;1.9)) or its integer multiples. However, the refractive index of actual antireflection film varies greatly with its forming conditions, so the actual thickness of the film has to be determined accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As an alternative method instead of forming an anti-reflection film on a base material, it is also effective for preventing the reflection of light between the photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide and the base material to make the optical thickness, which is defined as the product of the refractive index of film by the thickness, correspond to one-half or its integer multiples of the wavelength of light that is near the center of the visible region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> To take an example, when the central wavelength of a visible light is 550 nm with a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide having a refractive index of 2.5, the thickness of the photo-catalytic film can be adjusted to 110 nm (550/(2&times;2.5)) or its integer multiples as a rough estimate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, an explanation will be given on the experiment apparatus employed in the formation of photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a schematic diagram for an example of annealing apparatus that carries out crystallization in an atmosphere of reducing gas. Here an annealing apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is equipped with a chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that contains a base material coated of a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide (may be called simply &ldquo;base&rdquo; hereinafter), a UV light irradiation unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a heating unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a heat conducting plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that conveys heat from the heating unit, a unit that introduces and excludes atmospheric gas that is not shown in the figure, a path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for introducing atmospheric gas, a path <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for excluding atmospheric gas, and a vacuum evacuation unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> denotes a base plate made of base material coated with a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide. A temperature sensing unit is set up between the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the heat conducting plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, though not shown in the figure, and controls the temperature of the base plate (that is equal to the temperature of photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide) based on a temperature controlling unit, which is not shown in the figure. When using the annealing apparatus, the partial pressure of oxygen within the chamber is to be lowered. It is also possible to lower the partial pressure of oxygen by making a reducing gas flow in for a certain period instead of employing a vacuum evacuation unit. In this case, the vacuum evacuation unit can be omitted. Concerning the UV light irradiation unit, an excimer lamp is preferred. An electric heater is preferred for the heating unit, and a heat conducting ceramic plate may be employed for the heat conducting plate. A thermocouple may be used for the temperature sensing unit, and a turbo molecular pump may be used for the vacuum evacuation unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> When the vacuum evacuation unit is employed, the base plate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is put on the heat conducting plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> first, and the chamber is evacuated by the vacuum evacuation unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for decreasing the partial pressure of oxygen within the chamber. Then the heat conducting plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is heated by the heating unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a hot state. When the temperature reaches the predetermined annealing temperature, reducing gas such as a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen is introduced into the annealing apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Application of UV light is started as soon as the atmosphere within the apparatus is substituted with the reducing gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When the production of semiconductor film is conducted in vacuum according to the present invention, the unit for introducing and excluding atmospheric gas in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be replaced with a vacuum evacuation unit such as a turbo-molecular pump for removing the gas within the annealing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The production method of semiconductor film described in the present invention affords a low temperature annealing process, and thus makes the heating unit or the temperature controlling unit of special specification unnecessary. For the purpose, an inexpensive unit may be used to a large merit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the photoelectric conversion efficiency of a photo-catalytic film of amorphous titanium oxide annealed for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 30 minutes with a reference before annealing. The annealing temperature was set at 125&deg; C. (refer to EXAMPLE 1 for detailed conditions about the atmosphere and the application of light). As is clear from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the density of photoelectric current increased significantly after the annealing, which suggests crystallization of amorphous titanium oxide by the annealing. It is also clear that the longer annealing time caused an increase in the photoelectric current density. The obtained film was tested on an X-ray diffractometer, and an X-ray diffraction peak appeared at 2&thgr;&equals;25.260 (d&equals;3.52 &angst;), which represents crystal face (1,0,1) of anatase-type titanium oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide obtained according to the present invention is a crystal of anatase-type or a mixed crystal of anatase-type and rutile-type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a laminated material including at least a base material and a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide arranged in this order. When the base material is made of flexible plastic base materials, it can be wound to a roll and applied suitably to anti-pollution of building walls, etc. When the base material is made of light-transmitting plastic base materials or flexible light-transmitting base materials, the laminated material formed has the light-transmitting property and is suitable for anti-clouding and anti-pollution of mirrors and windows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> When an anti-reflection film is set up between the base material and the photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide in the above laminated material, the laminated material exhibits much improved light-transmitting property, and is particularly suitable for products that cause light reflection or transmission of light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As an alternative method instead of forming an anti-reflection film on a base material, it is also effective for improving the transmission of light of a laminated material to make the optical thickness, which is defined as the product of the refractive index of the film of titanium oxide by the thickness, correspond to one-half or its integer multiples of the wavelength of light that is near the center of the visible region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an example of a laminated material, in which a flexible plastic base material having the light-transmitting property is employed for the base. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the laminated material is made up of a PES film (125 &mgr;m thick), an anti-reflection film made of ZrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(65 &mgr;m thick), and a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide (200 &mgr;m thick). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the laminated material is made up of an ARTON film (188 &mgr;m thick), an anti-reflection film made of ITO (75 &mgr;m thick), and a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide (200 &mgr;m thick). Similarly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, the laminated material is made up of a PES film (150 &mgr;m thick) and a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide (110 &mgr;m thick). Here the thickness of titanium oxide film is optimized so that the reflection of light is minimized. In these experiments, the refractive index of titanium oxide employed is 2.5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A laminated material in total, which includes an anti-reflection film and a film of crystalline titanium oxide formed on a flexible base material, may be designed for a photo-catalytic sheet so as to function as the so-called photo-catalyst. In this case, a photo-catalytic sheet arranged or bonded on the surface of a material that needs the photo-catalytic activity can donate the photo-catalytic function to the surface. This sheet is substantially transparent against the visible light. In the case where the transparency is not strictly required, a flexible photo-catalytic sheet may be produced by forming a film of anatase-type titanium oxide directly on a plastic base material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> While the illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described with particularity, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the examples and descriptions set forth herein. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A 0.7-mm-thick non-alkaline glass plate (Corning No. 1737) was maintained at 180&deg; C., on which a film of amorphous titanium oxide was formed with a thickness of 110 nm by the RF sputtering method. The processed glass plate was maintained at 150&deg; C. in an experiment unit (about 1 liter in volume) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which had been removed of oxygen by vacuuming (10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>Pa) and filled with highly purified nitrogen gas with 3% hydrogen gas. (Flow rate: 1 L/min under the atmospheric pressure). Then UV light (wavelength: 172 nm, Intensity: 10 mW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) was irradiated on the glass plate for 10 minutes using an excimer lamp (product of USHIO ELECTRIC INC.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The annealed film tested on an X-ray diffractometer exhibited a diffraction peak at 2&thgr;&equals;25.260.

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> From these results, it was established that the amorphous titanium oxide was converted into a photo-catalyst by annealing. The refractive index of the obtained photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide was 2.5. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The example 1 was repeated except that a 0.15 mm thick plastic sheet (PES film, product of SUMITOMO BAKELITE CO. LTD.) was employed as the base, and the annealing temperature was changed to 130&deg; C., forming an annealed film on the plastic sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The formed film resulting from annealing was analyzed for X-ray diffraction intensity, and a diffraction peak was observed at 2&thgr;&equals;25.260. Investigation of the contact angle of the annealed film revealed that it was 2.5&deg;, confirming the highly hydrophilic property of the annealed surface. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The example 2 was repeated except that the annealing temperature was changed to 180&deg; C. and the annealing time was set at 5 minutes, yielding an photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide.

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The example 2 was repeated except that the annealing temperature was changed to 50&deg; C. and the annealing time was set at 120 minutes, yielding an photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide. The result was similar to that of the example 2. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In this example, a production method of photo-catalytic base material including a light-transmitting electro-conductive film and a photo-catalytic film formed on a light-transmitting plastic resin base is illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> A 188-&mgr;m-thick ARTON film was cleansed by water washing and maintained at 130&deg; C., on which an ITO film was formed with a thickness of 72 nm by the RF sputtering method, and the a film of amorphous titanium oxide (TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) with a thickness of 200 nm was formed on it. The processed film was maintained at 150&deg; C. in an annealing apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, introducing highly purified nitrogen gas with 3% hydrogen gas (Flow rate: 1 L/min under the atmospheric pressure). Then UV light (wavelength: 172 nm, Intensity: 10 mW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) was applied on the glass plate for 10 minutes using an excimer lamp (product of Ushio Electric Co. Ltd.). The refractive index of titanium oxide after annealing was 2.5, and the refractive index of the formed ITO film was 1.9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The current-voltage characteristics were studied on a film of titanium oxide before and after annealing with use of UV light (1 KW Hg&mdash;Xe lamp, 365 nm, 50 mW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) irradiation. The result was similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The formed film was analyzed for X-ray diffraction intensity, and a diffraction peaks was observed at 2&thgr;&equals;25.260, confirming a change of the crystal structure to anatase-type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The method of a forming a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide according to the present invention allows a very low temperature for the heated annealing compared with the existing methods which require high temperatures of about 1,000&deg; C. for annealing at formation of photo-catalytic film of crystalline titanium oxide by laser beam irradiation. Appilcation of UV light on the whole surface of the film is feasible with an ordinary UV light irradiation apparatus, and the scanning of laser beam spot is not needed. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a photo-catalytic film of titanium oxide within a shorter time than the existing methods, dispensing with a large-scale treatment apparatus. As a result, the production cost is significantly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> While in the existing methods a specific process or an apparatus is needed for forming a photo-catalytic film on a plastic base material as described heretofore, the present invention facilitates production of a photo-catalytic film on a plastic base material with a simple process or an apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Also in a complicated process according to the existing methods for applying anti-clouding, anti-pollution, or hydrophilic treatment on a mirror or a glass surface, an amorphous photo-catalytic film is first formed on the surface followed by sintering at more than 400&deg; C. In contrast, the method according to the present invention allows easy production of a photo-catalytic film on a plastic base material. Pasting such a processed base on a surface that needs anti-clouding, anti-pollution or hydrophilic property leads most simply to desired surface properties of the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-196562 filed on Jun. 28, 2001 including specification, claims, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
