<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to protective keyboard covers. More particularly, the present invention relates to a protective shield adapted for use on any commercially available keyboard assembly selected from numerous keyboard assemblies having different key configurations and having character inscriptions offset from imprinted indicia on the keyboard keys so as to enable simultaneous viewing of the character inscriptions and key indicia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Keyboards are an integral part of many machines such as word processing devices, personal computers and the like. Keyboards include a series or array of keys which are movable through a deck portion of the keyboard in order to generate an electrical or mechanical signal by movement of one or more keys. However, the presence of passages in the deck portion in the vicinity of the movable keys permits access of various contaminants such as water, dust and the like into the interior of the keyboard. The entry of such contaminants effects the internal operation resulting in malfunction of the keyboard and the expense of its replacement. Thus, there have been devised keyboard covers which prevent the entry of contaminants into the interior of the keyboard, especially in those passages between the keys and the deck of the keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There have devised keyboard covers made to cover the entire keyboard frame and include grooves molded to form-fit the four sides of all individual keys of the keyboard. Exemplary devices are the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,638 to Nopper et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,096,317 to Phillippe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the display of keyboards vary from device to device. For example, the &ldquo;enter&rdquo; key may be rectangular in shape on certain keyboards, and a backwards &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape in others. Other format keys including the &ldquo;caps lock&rdquo;, &ldquo;shift&rdquo;, &ldquo;control&rdquo;, &ldquo;alt&rdquo;, &ldquo;space bar&rdquo;, &ldquo;tab&rdquo; and &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; keys also vary from keyboard to keyboard. Although function keys typically are aligned along a top portion of the keyboard, the relative size and position of these keys can vary from keyboard to keyboard. Directional arrow or cursor keys, defined for purposes in this application as those keys having arrows thereon capable of moving the cursor up, down or side to side, as well as the &ldquo;insert&rdquo;, &ldquo;home&rdquo;, &ldquo;page up&rdquo;, &ldquo;delete&rdquo;, &ldquo;end&rdquo; and &ldquo;page down&rdquo; also vary in size and position from keyboard to keyboard. Although many keyboards include a 10-key pad, which is often fairly universal in nature, this cluster of keys is spaced from the other clusters to differing degrees from keyboard to keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, the result is that there are over 3,000 different keyboard covers. This is because each keyboard manufacturer uses different dimensions and spacing for the format, function keys, etc., of its brand/model of keyboard. Manufacturers of such keyboard covers must necessarily keep in stock nearly 3,000 different keyboard models with which the specific keyboard cover can be produced by thermo-formed or vacuum-molded plastic processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When purchasing, to assure proper fit of a prior-art keyboard cover, a consumer must order the cover by brand name and model or serial number. This is a rather lengthy and time-consuming process as the consumer must determine and inventory the model/serial number of each keyboard, locate the specific cover in a catalog/price list, compute the purchase amount, order the cover, pre-pay for the order, and then often wait weeks to receive the order. Those keyboard covers which do not produce high-volume orders must be manufactured as a low-volume custom order, increasing the cost of the cover. Some companies which have manufactured custom covers based on brand name/model number variations have discontinued manufacturing certain model numbers as the demand has been insufficient to merit maintaining its production capabilities. This leaves certain consumers without the option of adequately protecting the keyboard from environmental contaminants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present application discovered, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,050,825, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, that when the function and format keys were omitted from the keyboard cover design, and only the three or four alphanumeric rows are covered, then the keyboard cover shape becomes uniform and universal for flat and ergonomic keyboards. This is due to the fact that these three or four rows of alpha-numeric keys are the same size and configurations on nearly all models/brands of computer keyboards. Such a partial keyboard cover allowed the high-volume cost-effective manufacturing of opaque covers intended for keyboard memorization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The &apos;825 patent discloses printing foreign characters and the like onto an opaque keyboard cover so that when another keyboard layout, or foreign language, is selected, the partial keyboard cover can be placed over the alpha-numeric keys instead of having to cap or replace the keys of the keyboard, or have the foreign language characters and layout memorized. Although the opaque cover disclosed in the &apos;825 patent greatly improved upon prior keyboard covers, particularly in the keyboard memorization field, there have been found to be certain disadvantages with using such an opaque cover. Such masks typically only cover a portion of the keyboard and are not very effective in preventing, nor are they intended to prevent, contaminants from entering the interior of the keyboard. Also, for example, an American businessman having a meeting in Brazil may wish to have the option of typing either in Portuguese or English without having to remove the keyboard cover as the businessman may be working on multiple documents simultaneously, or the document may include sentences or paragraphs in either language. It has been found that in a religious setting, for example, a Jewish scholar may desire to have access to both the Hebrew keyboard layout and character inscriptions and the English keys simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a keyboard cover or shield which is capable of being utilized on any commercially available keyboard, and capable of being manufactured in high volume, thus decreasing the cost to the consumer. Such a cover should prevent contaminants from entering into the interior of the keyboard, especially in those passages between the keys and deck of the keyboard while including character inscriptions over the covered keys to enable the simultaneously viewing of the character inscriptions and the underlying key characters. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides other related advantages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention resides in a shield for protecting a keyboard assembly. The typical keyboard assembly has a plurality of keys defining a key array having an outer periphery defined by side walls of outer keys of the array. The keys of the keyboard are grouped into a plurality of key clusters. A deck portion of the keyboard assembly surrounds each key cluster and the key array. The shield of the present invention generally comprises a one-piece resiliently flexible membrane having a generally planar base overlaying the deck portion of the keyboard assembly to protect the keyboard from contaminants. In one form, a raised bubble is formed in the membrane and configured to envelope the key array. The bubble is defined by a raised wall approximating the height of the side walls of the keys defining the outer periphery of the key array, and is positioned immediately adjacent to the side wall so as to encircle the outer periphery of the key array. A generally planar cover extends from the raised wall and overlays top surfaces of the enclosed keys. Preferably, the membrane is transparent or translucent so as to enable the user to see the keys under the keyboard shield. However, the membrane may be opaque to facilitate keyboard memorization. An outer edge of the base is attached to the deck portion of the keyboard assembly, side walls of the keyboard assembly, or an obverse side of the keyboard assembly to hold the membrane in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another form, the raised wall encircles keys comprising an outer periphery of a cluster of keys to define a raised bubble enveloping one or more clusters of keys. Such cluster of keys comprises a function-key cluster, an alpha-numeric and command/format key cluster, a directional arrow or cursor key cluster, a 10-key pad key cluster or a combination of clusters. Preferably, multiple raised bubbles are formed, each raised bubble enveloping an individual or combined cluster of keys. In such an embodiment, the base overlays deck portions of the keyboard assembly between the keyboard clusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the raised bubble enveloping the alpha-numeric and command/format key cluster includes grooves configured to surround and form-fit the alphabetical, numerical, and punctuation keys of the cluster. These keys have been found to be universal amongst the numerous keyboard assemblies having different key configurations. Thus, bubbles are formed around clusters of keys, while the alphabetical, numerical and punctuation keys common amongst all keyboard assemblies are form-fitted so that a one-size-fits-all cover having the touch and feel of the individual keys commonly used in the keyboard is attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Character inscriptions are formed on a top surface of the membrane over predetermined covered keys of the keyboard and offset from imprinted indicia on the covered keys so as to enable the simultaneous viewing of the key character membrane character. Typically, such character inscriptions include alphabetical, numerical and punctuation symbols formed on the membrane over corresponding form-fitted alphabetical, numeric and punctuation keys. The character inscriptions can comprise foreign language symbols, Braille symbols, Dvorak layout symbols, etc. Thus, the user may continue to have the keyboard protectively covered while using either the keyboard layout, or the layout imprinted onto the cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration, the present invention is concerned with a protective shield, generally referred to in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by the reference number <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by the reference number <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the reference number <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by the reference number <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. The shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is designed to overly a top face of a keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to prevent the entry of particles, liquids and other contaminants within the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, while being universal in nature so that it can be applied to any commercially available keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are well known in the art and have become an integral part of many machines including word processing devices and computers. Such keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> include a rigid frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> defining a top deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, side walls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a rear or obverse face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also includes a plurality of keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which are generally formed into rows and columns having a predetermined configuration and collectively forming a two-dimensional array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Each key <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extends through the deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and by depression operate, either electronically or mechanically, through intervening means (not shown), so as to generate a signal to the device with which the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is associated. The various keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be of varying size, but all keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> generally include a relatively planar top surface and side walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which extend from the top surface toward the frame deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The side walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> generally have a small degree of taper, as illustrated in the drawings. It will be appreciated that there exist openings between the frame deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the individual keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that the keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be depressed into the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to generate the appropriate signal. As described above, a common problem with keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is that liquids, particles and other contaminants enter through these openings and adversely affect the typically electronic intervening means within the keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> protective shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> embodying the present invention is illustrated which is comprised of a one-piece resiliently flexible membrane, such as polyurethane, plastic or rubber material, which is preferably transparent or translucent so as to enable a user of the shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to view the keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through the shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be opaque to facilitate keyboard memorization. The shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is manufactured using conventional thermo-forming, vacuum molding, or any other suitable method of molding and formation. The shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a generally planar base <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which overlays the deck portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Although the planar base <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown in the drawings as attached to an obverse face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the various FIGS., it should be understood by the reader that the planar base <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be attached directly to the deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, frame sidewalls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, or obverse face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by hook and loop tape, adhesive, or any other suitable means to hold the shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in place on the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A raised bubble <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed in the flexible membrane and configured to envelope the key array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The bubble <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is defined by a raised wall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which approximates the heights of the key side walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and extends around an outer periphery of the key array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so as to encircle the key array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A generally planar cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends from the raised wall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the bubble <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and overlays the top surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the plurality of keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprising the key array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thus, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> single bubble <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed which substantially envelopes the key array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The bubble <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is positioned immediately adjacent to the side walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the peripheral keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the key array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that the planar base <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the membrane substantially rests upon the deck portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as described above protects the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from water, dust and other contaminants while universally fitting over the key array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of any commercially available keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the key array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can actually be divided into a number of key clusters. For example, a top row of keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprising the &ldquo;escape&rdquo;, &ldquo;functions 1-12&rdquo;, &ldquo;print screen&rdquo;, &ldquo;scroll&rdquo;, &ldquo;pause break&rdquo;, and in certain models &ldquo;number lock&rdquo;, &ldquo;caps lock&rdquo;, and &ldquo;scroll lock&rdquo; are aligned with one another and form what is referred to collectively in this application as a function-key cluster <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The spacing between the keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the function-key cluster <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> varies from keyboard assembly manufacturer, with some manufacturers including the number lock, caps lock or scroll lock keys, while others do not include these raised keys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> All commercially available keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also include a 10-key cluster <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> comprising a &ldquo;numbers lock&rdquo;, &ldquo;/&rdquo;, &ldquo;*&rdquo;, &ldquo;7&rdquo;, &ldquo;8&rdquo;, &ldquo;9&rdquo;, &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo;, &ldquo;5&rdquo;, &ldquo;6&rdquo;, &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;2&rdquo;, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, &ldquo;0&rdquo;, &ldquo;.&rdquo;, and &ldquo;enter&rdquo; keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> All commercially available keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also include what is referred to in this application as a cursor-key cluster <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> comprising the &ldquo;insert&rdquo;, &ldquo;home&rdquo;, &ldquo;page up&rdquo;, &ldquo;delete&rdquo;, &ldquo;end&rdquo;, &ldquo;page down&rdquo;, and directional arrow or cursor keys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Each commercially available keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also includes what is referred to in this application as an alpha-numeric and format/command key cluster <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> comprising the alphabetical, numeric, punctuation and symbols (including &ldquo;-&rdquo;, &ldquo;_&rdquo;, &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&equals;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&lcub;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&lsqb;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&rcub;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&rsqb;&rdquo;, &ldquo;:&rdquo;, &ldquo;;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;,&ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;, &ldquo;,&rdquo;, &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;, &ldquo;.&rdquo;, &ldquo;&quest;&rdquo;, &ldquo;/&rdquo;, &ldquo;back space&rdquo;, &ldquo;tab&rdquo;, &ldquo;caps lock&rdquo;, &ldquo;enter&rdquo;, &ldquo;right and left shift&rdquo;, &ldquo;control&rdquo;, &ldquo;alt&rdquo;, &ldquo;space bar&rdquo; and &ldquo;&tilde;/&apos;&rdquo; keys. Different manufacturers may place additional keys within the alpha-numeric and format/command key cluster <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which are specific in use to the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and machine to which it is operably connected. These unique keys are typically placed on either side of the &ldquo;space bar key&rdquo;. Thus, the &ldquo;space bar key&rdquo; can be of varying lengths depending upon the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> shield <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> embodying the present invention is shown which is similar to that described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but divided into a plurality of key cluster bubbles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> each covering a cluster of keys <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A function-key cluster bubble <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a raised wall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which encircles the function-key cluster <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends from the raised wall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so that the bubble <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> envelopes the keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the function-key cluster <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that the function-key cluster bubble <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends across the entire length of the function-key cluster <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, whether there are any number, caps, or scroll lock keys or not so as to accommodate keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having such raised keys. Similarly, a 10-key cluster bubble <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> envelopes the keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the 10-key cluster <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, raised walls <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the bubble <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> encircle the outer periphery of the 10-key cluster <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and a cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends from the raised wall <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so as to envelope the 10-key cluster keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Likewise, a cursor-key cluster bubble <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and alpha-numeric and format/command key cluster bubble <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> envelope the cursor-key cluster <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and alpha-numeric and format/command key cluster <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, respectively. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the planar base <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the shield membrane overlays the deck portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the various key clusters <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The planar base <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also preferably extends over the frame sidewalls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for attachment to the obverse face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with adhesive or double-sided tape <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> or other appropriate attachment means. However, the planar base <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can extend only to the farthest edge of the deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and be secured there or on the sidewalls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the function-key cluster bubble <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and alpha-numeric and format/command key cluster bubble <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are shown with the shield membrane forming a &ldquo;V&rdquo; instead of lying substantially parallel to or on the deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between these bubbles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. This is due to the fact that there is a variable distance of a fraction of an inch between the function-key cluster <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the other key clusters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> between makes and model of keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, necessitating the &ldquo;V&rdquo; configuration. The &ldquo;V&rdquo; configuration provides maximum width for bubbles <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which permits optimal, lateral space to the left or right of the key clusters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> covered by these bubbles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It has also been found that there are slight variations in distance between the 10-key cluster <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and cursor-key cluster <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> between the various brand names and models. Thus, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> similar &ldquo;V&rdquo; configuration in the shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the key clusters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be utilized to accommodate for this variable distance. Alternatively, a single bubble (not shown) could envelop the keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of both the 10-key cluster <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and cursor-key cluster <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> referred to herein as a combined 10-key and cursor-key cluster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Although the spacing between the cursor-key cluster <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the alpha-numeric and format/command key cluster <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is fairly standard, such a &ldquo;V&rdquo; configuration could be formed between the bubbles <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> enveloping these key clusters <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as well if found necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, yet another shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> embodying the present invention is illustrated, wherein the shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes function-key cluster bubble <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> overlying the function keys <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and a single bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> overlying the 10-key cluster <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, cursor-key cluster <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and alpha-numeric and format/command key cluster <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Grooves <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are formed in the alphanumeric and format/command key cluster <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so that the bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> substantially surrounds and form-fits only to the alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation and symbol keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The form-fitted keys comprise what is known in the art as the four alpha-numeric rows. That portion of the bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> being grooved to form-fit the alpha-numeric keys is designated by the reference number <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. Regardless of the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> type, the four rows of alpha-numeric keys are of the same size and configuration. Thus, no matter the model or brand of the computer keyboard, the keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the alpha-numeric rows can be substantially form-fitted within the bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; key, &ldquo;&tilde;-&apos;&rdquo;, &ldquo;enter&rdquo;, &ldquo;tab&rdquo;, &ldquo;shift&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ctrl&rdquo;, &ldquo;Alt&rdquo;, &ldquo;space bar&rdquo;, and other formatting and command keys are not form-fitted as these keys vary in size, configuration, and placement between the various keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, the bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> forms a uniform bubble having a generally planar cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> over the 10-key cluster keys <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, cursor-key cluster keys <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and format and command keys of the alphanumeric and format/command key cluster <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, with the alpha-numeric and punctuation keys being form-fitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> could be altered so that not all of the alpha-numeric or punctuation keys are form-fitted. For example, the punctuation and symbol keys could underlie the generally planar cover <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and not be form-fitted. However, it is preferable that all of the alpha-numeric and punctuation and symbol keys which are universally common between the various model and brand keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> be form-fitted so as to preserve their touch and feel. Of course, the four alpha-numeric rows in any of the previously described and illustrated embodiments could be form-fitted as well while retaining the configuration of the bubble(s) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Aside from providing a natural feel to the keystroke of each of these keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, these alpha-numeric and punctuation keys can be covered by the opaque, one-size-fits-all computer keyboard cover disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,050,825 by Nichol et al., which facilitates memorization of these keys. Thus, this shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when covered by the opaque cover of Nichols et al. can be used to facilitate memorization of the alphabetical, numerical, and punctuation keys, as well as providing a protective cover which can be used universally on all commercially available keyboard assemblies <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With reference now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; which is a variation of shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> is illustrated. The shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is configured as described above, and has character inscriptions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> imprinted, embossed, or otherwise formed on the form-fitted alpha-numeric key section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; of the bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>&prime;. The character inscriptions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are formed on the pertinent form-fitted key section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; so that as the shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is attached to the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the alpha-numeric rows and corresponding keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, are form-fitted and the character inscriptions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are offset from the key inscriptions (alphabetical letters, numbers, punctuation, etc. of the alpha-numeric rows) so that the user is able to view the character inscriptions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the alphanumeric key characters simultaneously. It will be noted that the alphanumeric key characters are imprinted on the keys so as to leave a portion of the top surface of the key <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> devoid of any markings. The character inscription <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; are imprinted such that when the shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is fitted onto the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the character inscription <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> overlie this blank portion of the top surface of the key <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A Russian (Cyrillic) keyboard layout is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. It will be noted that certain key characters are the same, and thus are not imprinted onto the form-fitted section of the alpha-numeric keys <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime;. Although the Russian layout is illustrated, it should be understood that other foreign language alphabetical and numeric symbols may be formed on the form-fitted alpha-numeric punctuation key section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; of the bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>&prime;, such as Hebrew, Portuguese, etc. Also, other keyboard layout configurations, such as Dvorak, QWERTY, etc., can be imprinted or otherwise formed on the form-fitted bubble section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime;. The imprinted character inscriptions <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can also comprise symbols or the like, for example, Braille characters. The object of the invention being to form the character inscription <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and place such character inscriptions on the form-fitted alpha-numeric punctuation key section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; of the bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>&prime; to the benefit of the user of the invention. Due to the fact that the form-fitted alpha-numeric key section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>&prime; of the bubble <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>&prime; form-fits to the relevant keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the imprinted, or otherwise formed, character inscription <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are automatically positioned correctly with respect to the blank portion of the key surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the shield <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime; is attached to the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It will therefore be appreciated that the present invention provides a protective shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for a keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which totally prevents contamination of the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by completely encapsulating a top surface keyboard array <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The present invention also permits the retention, to varying degrees, of the touch or feel of the individual keys <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the operator of the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Of particular importance, the shields <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the present invention are configured such that they can be used on any commercially available keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, eliminating the expensive requirement to manufacture and pre-order very specific keyboard covers according to model and brand type. Additionally, the present invention allows the simultaneous viewing of not only the keyboard layout of the keyboard assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, but also the simultaneous viewing of the alpha-numeric key characters and the imprinted indicia characters <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to provide the benefits described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Ultimately, the invention could be manufactured as a disposable cover for use in hospitals, doctor and dentist offices. These could be manufactured very thin so as to become a single-use, disposable product. Such a cover would be particularly advantageous due to the concern for hazardous bio-waste which routinely contaminates keyboards in these settings. Additionally, the invention could be manufactured as an inexpensive, disposable cover for use in school classrooms, libraries, and offices in order to minimize the spread of contagious viruses and bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Although several embodiments have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made to each without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited, except as by the appended claims. </paragraph>
