<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A provider of digital subscriber line (DSL) services often has the need and/or desire to enable, disable add, change and test DSL services of a subscriber. Enabling, disabling, adding, changing and testing DSL services are hereinafter referred to jointly as provisioning of DSL services. In many instances, the responsiveness and manner in which provisioning of DSL services is carried out can have a tremendous impact on subscriber loyalty and expanding a subscriber base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Provisioning of some DSL services, such as disabling DSL service and disconnecting physical transmission lines, is capable of being performed at a DSL service provider location (i.e. at a central office communication apparatus). However, provisioning of many DSL services has traditionally required dispatching a service provider technician to service a customer premise network interface device (NID). Dispatching a service provider technician is costly and time consuming. Furthermore, the time element associated with dispatching a service provider technician for provisioning of DSL services and the related inconvenience of a DSL service subscriber can adversely affect maintaining subscriber loyalty and growing a subscriber base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According, a method and a apparatus capable of enabling a network interface device to be provisioned remotely are each useful. </paragraph>
