<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Next, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</cross-reference>, there will be given on another example of the information notification processing in the information notifying system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, an abnormality notification from the security server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the user is performed by voice. When the warning signal receiving section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> receives a warning signal from one of the sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the warning signal receiving section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> notifies information on the abnormality (such as a place where the abnormality has occurred, a kind of abnormality, and the like) to the voice notification control section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Then, the voice notification control section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> selects an abnormality notification announcement corresponding to the information on the abnormality to call the portable telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> owned by the user via the communication control section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so that the abnormal notification announcement is notified to the user ({circle over (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)} abnormality notification shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). At this time, the voice notification control section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> simultaneously transmits an command to the notification situation supervision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that the notification situation supervision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> starts to measure time by the timer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>and to count the number of calling by the counter <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> When the user answers to calling the portable telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the communication control section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> transmits the abnormality notification announcement to the user. Then, the communication control section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> transmits a command to the notification situation supervision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to stop measuring time by the timer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>and counting the number of calling by the counter <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Then, the information notification processing is terminated. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, after termination of the information notification processing, the user notifies the occurrence of the abnormality to the public institutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> If one of the followings takes place in relation to the abnormality notification {circle over (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)} (calling the portable telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> (1) in spite of calling the user for a predetermined period, a response is not received (this may include answer phone); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> (2) the portable telephone terminal is in a state where radio waves can not be received (power is off or the portable telephone terminal is in a place where radio waves does not reach, etc.); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> (3) the line is busy, the communication control section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> transmits a command to the notification situation supervision section <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> so that the counter <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>increments the number of calling by one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> After a predetermined period has elapsed (the predetermined period may be 0 second) from calling, the communication control section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> calls the portable telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to notify the abnormal notification announcement again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> When the number of calling counted by the counter <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is equal to or larger than a predetermined value, the server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> determines that the abnormality notification announcement can not be notified to the user, and notifies the abnormality notification mail to the security center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via the communication control section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The abnormality notification mail is prepared as well as the above described examples. The information notification processing at this time is similar to the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and the description therefor other than that notification from the security server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the security center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the portable telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is performed by voice ({circle over (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)} and {circle over (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>)} shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Thus, the detailed description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a drawing showing another example of an information notification processing in which abnormality notification is simultaneously notified to the portable telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the security center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the warning signal receiving section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the security server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives a warning signal from one of the sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the security server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> prepares an abnormality notification mail that has embedded a link to the image shot by the supervision camera <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> upon occurrence of the abnormality and recorded in the image storage section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to transmit the mail to the security center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> via the communication control section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the voice notification control section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> selects an abnormality notification announcement corresponding to the information on the abnormality to call the portable telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> owned by the user via the communication control section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In case that request of access to the image storage section <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is transmitted from the security center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the security server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the security server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> grants an access with restrictions that an access to a predetermined image information is inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When an abnormality notification announcement is notified to the portable telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the security server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> notifies the fact to the security center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Whereby it is possible to prevent action not fitting the user&apos;s intention from being taken in the security center <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in spite that the user recognizes the occurrence of an abnormality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In the aforementioned embodiments, in case that a plurality of portable telephone terminals <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are registered with the terminal information retaining section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, one of the notification by mail and the notification by voice may be registered as information notification means of each telephone terminal <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the terminal information retaining section <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the invention, even when user having a portable terminal does not or can not confirm detection information, an abnormality, which has occurred, can be coped. </paragraph>
