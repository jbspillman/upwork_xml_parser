<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method is provided for treating mammals, including humans, with advanced or large-tumour burdens. The method involves administering an immunotherapeautic agent in conjunction with a tumour growth restricting agent, in amounts effective to eradicate any advanced or large tumours present. In preferred embodiments, the immunotherapeautic agent comprises a T-cell co-stimulatory cell adhesion molecule (CAM) or a mammalian expression vector containing DNA which encodes a T-cell co-stimulatory CAM, such as B7.1, and the tumour growth restricting agent is flavone acetic acid, 5,6-dimenthyl-xanthenone-4-acetic acid, or an agent which disrupts the expression or activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention is directed to the use of therapeutic agents in combination to combat cancer. In particular it is directed to combinations of therapeutic agents which are effective against advanced and large tumour burdens. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Advanced cancers and large tumours burdens are refractory to treatment with therapeutic agents. Although these same agent may be effective against smaller tumours, their use does not achieve complete eradication of large tumour burdens. Large tumours can continue to grow unchecked, or their re-growth is not recongnised by the body&apos;s immune system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition, tumours acquire defensive and survival functions which limit the efficacy of therapeutic agents and/or the body&apos;s own immune response. For unknown reasons large tumor burdens appear to either impair or retard the generation of anti-tumour cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. In immunotherapy, gene transfer of T cell co-stimulatory cell adhesion molecules is effective against only very small tumours and only weak anti-tumours systemic immunity is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a therapeutic combination that will at least partially overcome the resistance of large tumour burdens to immunotherapy, or at least provide the public with a useful choice in the treatment of cancer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in a first aspect the invention provides a method of treatment for mammals, including humans, with advanced or large tumour burdens comprising the administration of an immunotherapeautic agent in conjunction with a tumour growth-restricting agent, either if which alone would be ineffective in retarding or eradicating an advanced or large tumour burden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a patient with cancer which comprises the step of administering to said patient an immunotherapeutic agent and a tumour growth restricting agent in amounts which are together effective to eradicate any advanced or large tumours present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In still a further aspect, the invention provides a method of potentiating the activity of an immunotherapeutic agent against tumours present in a patient suffering from cancer which comprises the step of administering to said patient when treated with said immunotherapeutic agent an amount of a tumour growth restricting agent, which is effective, in combination with the immunotherapeutic agent to eradicate any advanced or large tumours present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In yet a further aspect, the invention provides a method of potentiating the activity of a tumour growth restricting agent tumours present in a patient suffering from cancer which comprises the step of pre-administering to a patient to be treated with said tumour growth restricting agent an amount of an immunotherapeutic agent which, upon subsequent administration of said tumour growth restricting agent, acts in combination with said tumour growth restricting agent to eradicate any advanced or tumours present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;immunotherapeutic agent&rdquo; means a preparation which when administered to the patient results in a systemic anti-tumour immune response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the preparation will contain DNA, and typically, the immunotherapeutic agent will be a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation of DNA to be injected in to the tumour at one or more sites so as to confer properties on the tumour tissue which generates a systemic anti-tumour immune response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;tumour growth restricting agent&rdquo; means an agent which restricts or prevents tumour growth in a patient through reducing blood flow to tumours, including by inhibiting or preventing angiogenesis. Such an agent may also have other anti-tumour/immunoregulatory activities addition to reducing blood flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the immunotherapeutic agent will contain DNA encoding a T cell co-stimulatory cell adhesion molecule (CAM), more preferably in a suitable expression vector. Most conveniently the CAM will be B7.1, B7.2 or a xenogemic (human) form of an integrin ligand, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Conveniently, the tumour growth restricting agent is flavone acetic acid (FAA) or an analogue of xanthenone-4 acetic acid (XAA). The XAA analogue 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the tumour growth restricting agent may be an agent which disrupts the expression or activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Conveniently, this may be achieved by anti-sense therapy, and in particular by administration of an expression vector which encodes an anti-sense version of HIF-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the immunotherapeutic agent is administered prior to administration of the tumour growth restricting agent. More preferably, the immunotherapeutic agent is administered from 12 to 48 prior to administration of the tumour growth restricting agent. Most preferably, administration of the immunotherapeutic agent occurs approximately 24 hours prior to administration of the tumour growth restricting agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, the methods of the present invention may further include the administration of an additional tumour growth restricting agent. This agent may be an agent which disrupts the expression or activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). This may conveniently be achieved by anti-sense therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In still a further aspect, the present invention provides a chemotherapeutic pack which includes, in separate containers, both an immunotherapeutic agent and a tumour growth restricting as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In still further aspect, the invention provides for the use of a tumour growth restricting agent in the preparation of a medicament for potentiating the activity of an immunotherapeutic agent against advanced or large tumours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In yet a further aspect, the invention provides for the use of an immunotherapeutic agent in the preparation of a medicament for potentiating the activity of a tumour growth restricting agent against advanced or large tumours.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While the invention is broadly defined as above, those persons skilled in the art will appreciate that it is not limited thereto and that is also includes embodiments of which the following description provides examples. In addition, the present invention will be better understood from reference to the accompanying drawings in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Combining the drugs DMXAA or FAA with B7.1 immunogene generates potent anti-tumour systemic immunity, whereas monotherapies are uneffective. (A) CAM gene transfer is unable to cause the rejected of large tumours. Established tumours 0.5 cm in diameter were injected with DOTAP liposomes containing 60 &mgr;g of B7.2, ICAM-1, MAdCAM-1, and VCAM-1 cDNA. Control animals received 60 &mgr;g of empty pCDM8 vector, or liposomes. Gene transfer of each CAM slowed tumour growth, but ultimately tumours grew unchecked, and animals had to be euthanased. (B) Combining the drugs DMXAA or FAA with B7.1 immunogene eradicates large tumours. Animals bearing 0.6-0.8 cm tumours were injected i.p with DMXAA or FAA at 300 mg/Kg and 25 mg/Kg of body weight in a volume of 0.01 ml/g body weight, respectively. For animals receiving combinational treatments, tumours were injected with DOTAP liposomes containing 60 &mgr;g of B7.1 cDNA, and DMXAA or FAA were administered 24 h later. Control animals received 60 &mgr;g of empty pCDM8 vector, or liposomes alone, as indicated. The size (cm) of tumours was monitored for 42 days following gene transfer. Mice were euthanased if tumours reached more than 1 cm in diameter (denoted by small vertical arrows). The experiment was repeated twice. Mice that were cured of their tumours were rechallenged (large vertical arrow) after 42 days with 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>parental tumour calls, and mice monitored for tumour regrowth for a further 22 days. (C) Photograph of mice with established and treated tumours. Illustrated is a mouse bearing a large (0.8 cm) established E tumour, and mice bearing similar sized tumours 8 and 29 days following treatment with the combination of B7.1 and DMXAA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> Combining B7.1 immunotherapy with DMXAA therapy generates increased CTL activity, which can be adoptively transferred to eradicate tumours. (A) Comparison of anti-tumour CTL activity generated by the different treatment regimes. Splenoytes were removed from animals 21 days following the different treatment regimes, and were tested for cytolytic activity against EL-4 tumour cells. The percent cytotoxicity is plotted against various effector to target (E:T) ratios. Control animals received empty pCDM8 vector or liposomes alone. The insert illustrates the cytolytic ac of splenocytes harvested from animals 42 days after treatment with B7.1-DMXAA, and a further 22 days later (day 64) following a rechallenge with parental E4 tumour cells. (B) Eradication of established tumours by adoptive transfer of anti-tumour CTL from treated mice. splenocytes (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>) were adoptively transferred by intratumoral and i.p. injection, from treated and control mice to recipient mice bearing established tumours (&tilde;0.6 cm in diameter). Each bar represents the mean&plus;SD of results from 5 or 6 mice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Anti-tumour immunity is largely mediated by CDS&plus; T cells and NK cells. Tumours (&tilde;0.6 cm diameter) were established in mice, and the contribution of leukocyte subsets to combination therapy was examined by antibody blockade. Four days prior to treatment and every alternate day for the duration of the experiment, mAbs were administered against (a) CD<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (GK1.5 mAb); (b) NK cells (PK136 mAb); (c) CD8. Each panel (a-f) includes a control experiment in which the anti-leukocyte blocking mAB(s) was substituted with rat IgG. Mice were killed if tumours reached more than 1 cm in diameter (denoted by vertical arrows). Each bar represents the mean&plus;SD of results from 5 or 6 mice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Combination therapy obviates the narrow range of therapeutic reagent dosages required for effective therapy. Tumours (&tilde;0.5 cm diameter) were established after 17 days, and injected with different amounts of B7.1 cDNA (90-180 &mgr;g). Twenty-four hours later, DMXAA was administered intraperitoneally at 25 mg/Kg body weight (upper panel), and 18 kmg/Kg (lower panel). Each bar represents the mean&plus;SD of results from 5 or 6 mice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The mechanism of tumour cell death in response to B7.1 versus DMXAA therapy is different. Sections from established tumours were prepared 7 and 21 days following treatment, stained by TUNEL analysis for apoptotic cells (green fluorescent cells showing condensed fragmented nuclei), and counter-stained with propidium iodide (orange) to reveal necrotic cells, x 100. Illustrated are representative sections (a) 7days following B7.1 treatment; (b) 21 days after B7.1 treatment; (c) 7 days after B7.1-DMXAA combination therapy; (d) 7 days after DMXAA administration; and (e) 7 days after injection of empty control vector. Tumour cell apoptosis in response to B7.1 monotherapy was followed by necrosis as revealed by the apoptotic (AI) and necrotic (NI) indices (f), whereas DMXAA monotherapy was not preceded by tumour cell apoptosis at the times examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> Vascular attack and B7.1 therapies induce the upregulation of tumour heat shock proteins. Immunohistochemical detection of hsp70 expression tumours 7 days following administration of (a) DMXAA, x 40; (b) B7.1-DMXAA combination, x 40; (c) B7.1 monotherapy, x 40; (d) B7.1-DMXAA combination, x 60; (e) empty vector, x 60; and (f) sections as in (b) were also stained with a control rat IgG as primary antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> Treatment of a single tumour nodule leads to the eradication of multiple distant tumour nodules. A large single tumour (&tilde;0.5 cm diameter) was established in one flank, and four smaller tumours of &tilde;0.2 cm in diameter in the other flank. Gene transfer of B7.1 cDNA expression plasmid into the larger tumour, followed by systemic DMXAA therapy led to the rejection of all five tumours. Mice remained tumour-free for 35 days. For whatever reason, if the injected tumour was not larger than the non-injected tumour nodules, then tumour growth was only retarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Intratumoral (IT) injection of B7-1, followed by intratumoral injection of DMXAA. The normal dosage of DMXAA (25 mg/kg) was injected. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of DMXAA is included as a control. Open arrows denote tumours eradicated, and closed arrows denote animals euthanised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Antisense HIF-1&agr; therapy downregulates the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF, and inhibits the formation of tumour blood vessels. (A) Down-regulation of HIF-1 and VEGF by antisense HIF-1&agr; therapy. Tumours 0.1 cm in diameter were injected with DOTAP liposomes containing either empty vector (a, c), or antisense HIF-1&agr; cDNA (b, d). Illustrated are representative tumour sections prepared 4 days following gene transfer, stained brown with mAbs against HIF-1&agr; (a, b), and VEGF (c, d). (B) Antisense HIF-1&agr; therapy blocks the formation of new tumour blood vessels. (a) Illustrated are sections prepared from 4 cm tumours injected 4 days earlier with either empty vector (pcDNA3), or antisense HIF-1&agr;. Endothelial cells within sections were stained with the anti-CD31 mAb, revealing tumour blood vessels (examples denoted by arrows). (C) Measurement of blood vessel density. Blood vessels stained with the anti-CD31 mAb were counted in blindly chosen random fields to record mean vessel density in tumours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Monotherapies utilizing antisense HIF-1&agr; anti-angiogenic therapy, and B7-1 mediated immunotherapy, are only effective against small tumours. Established tumours approximately 0.1 (a) and 0.4 (b) cm in diameter, were injected at day 0 with DOTAP liposomes containing either B7-1 cDNA, antisense HIF-1&agr; cDNA; or empty vector in the case of control animals. The sizes (cm) of tumours was recorded following gene transfer. Complete tumour regression is denoted by vertical arrows. Mice were euthanased if tumours reached more than 1 cm in diameter (denoted by stars). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Combining antisense HIF-1&agr; therapy with B7.1 immunotherapy causes the rapid rejection of large tumours. Tumours 0.4 cm in diameter were injected with DOTAP liposomes containing B7-1 DNA, followed 48 h later by either antisense (aHF) or sense (sHF) HIF-1&agr; cDNA. Control animals received empty vector. The sizes (cm) of tumours was recorded following gene transfer. Mice were euthanased if tumours reached more than 1 cm in diameter (denoted by stars). Complete tumour regression is denoted by vertical arrows. Cured mice were rechallenged with 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>parental tumour cells, but developed no tumours during the 2 months they were monitored (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Shows results achieved using triple treatment (DMXAA&plus;B7.1&plus;anti-sense HIF-1 therapy), versus other treatment regimes as shown. The triple treatment caused the most rapid eradication of tumour. Anti-angiogenic reagents administered alone or together with each other were not effective.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As outlined above in broad terms, the present invention provides a method of combination therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced or heavy tumour burdens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It has been noted that advanced tumour growth is accompanied by the ability of the tumours to acquire unknown mechanisms by which they may resist the body&apos;s systemic anti-tumour immune response. Although the administration of chemotherapeutic agents or other means of cancer therapy may initially cause regression in the growth of the tumours, the body&apos;s immune response is unable to prevent or limit the re-growth of tumourgenic tissue that has not been eradicated from the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The applicants have now determined that by combining methods of immunotherapy with methods of chemotherapy previously demonstrated to be ineffective in the long term ;treatment of advanced or heavy tumour burdens, regression of tumours is combined with the stimulation of a strong, systemic anti-tumour immune response </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The two therapeutic agents employed therefore operate in a synergistic manner to provide a combined effect which exceeds that predictable from the known properties of each. This is particularly true where, as is presently preferred, the immunotherapeutic agent is a preparation of DNA encoding a T cell co-simulatory cell adhesion molecule (CAM) or an integrin ligand and the tumour growth restricting agent is flavone acetic acid (FAA) or an analogue of xanthenone-4 acetic acid (XAA) such as DMXAA, or is an agent which disrupts the expression or activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Optimized gene transfer of T-cell co-simulatory cell adhesion molecules (CAM), including B7.1, B7.2, and xenogeneic (human) forms of the integrin ligands VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1, and ICAM-1 has been shown to cause rapid and complete rejection of established tumours. Prolonged systemic anti-tumour immunity is generated, whereas other cell adhesion molecules such as human E-cadherin have only a weak ability to slow tumour growth. However, CAM-mediated immunotherapy is problematic in that it is effective against only small tumours and it generates only weak anti-tumour systemic immunity. Larger tumour burdens are able to either impair of retard the generation of anti-tumour cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) rendering the tumours resistant to immunotherapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The anticancer agents flavone acetic acid (FAA) and 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) cause initial reductions in tumour size when administered, but tumours subsequently grow unchecked, and both reagents generate a weak and ineffective anti-tumour CTL response. DMXAA and FAA appear to exert their anti-tumour activities via several pathways including reduction of tumour blood flow leading to hemorrhagic necrosis and the induction of multiple immunomodulatory factors including cytokines, nitric oxide, and activated natural killer cells. However, neither agent is able to generate the desired anti-tumour systemic immunity, and they are ineffective against large tumour burdens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The finding made by the applicants that administration of these agents in combination is effective to both eradicated advanced or large tumours and to generate anti-tumour systemic immunity is therefore surprising and representative of a significant advance in cancer treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The immunotherapeutic agent can be, or include, DNA (usually cDNA) encoding human (Genbank U82483) or mouse (Genbank L21203) MAdCAM-1, human VCAM-1 (Genbank M60335), ICAM-1 (Genbank J03132), mouse (Genbank X06115) or human (Genbank L08599) E-cadherin, B7.1 (Genbank AF065896) or B7.2 (Genbank L25606). Such cDNA&apos;s can be synthesised or obtained from commercial or other sources. For example, human VCAM-1 can be obtained from Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (HGS), whereas B7.1 can be sourced from Dr. P. Linsley, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Seattle, Wash., USA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Sources for other cDNA&apos;s are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Human MAdCAM-1&mdash;from HGS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Mouse MAdCAM-1&mdash;from Dr Eugene Butcher, Stanford University, Stanford, USA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Human E-cadherin&mdash;from Drs Rimm and Morrow, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Conn, USA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Mouse E-cadherin&mdash;from Dr M Takeichi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Human B7.2&mdash;from Dr Gordon Freeman, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Md., USA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the invention, the immunotherapeutic agent will be administered in the form of a mammalian expression vector. While any such vector available to the skilled artisan may be selected, typical vectors include expression plasmids such as pCDNA8 and pCDM8, and adenoviral-and retroviral-based vectors (such as pLXSN and pLNCX). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the immunotherapeutic agent may be administered directly, in a form other than in a mammalian expression vector, that is, it is not essential that the immunotherapeutic agent be administered using gene therapy. For example, T cell costimulatory CAM proteins that could be attached to the cell surface could be administered systemically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The tumour growth restricting agent can be any available agent which exerts an anti-tumour effect, at least in part, by restricting tumour blood flow. The agent may also have other, equally potent, anti-tumour properties, including immunoregulatory properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In some preferred embodiments of the invention, the tumour growth restricting agent will be FAA, or a functional analogue of XAA. DMXAA is particularly preferred. Preferred analogues of XAA are those of the formula (I):

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> wherein R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>a each independently selected from the group consisting of H, C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>alkyl, halogen, CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, CN, NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, OH, OR, NHCOR, NHSO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>R, SR, SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>R or wherein each R is independently C1-C<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>alkyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from hydroxy, amino and methoxy, and wherein each of R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and R, may be present at any of the available positions 1 to 8; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> and wherein in each of the carbocyclic aromatic rings in formula (I), up to two of the methine (&mdash;CH&boxH;) groups may be replaced by an aza (&mdash;N&boxH;) group; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> and wherein any two of R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>may additionally together represent the group &mdash;CH&boxH;CH-CH&boxH;CH&mdash;, such that this group, together with the carbon or nitrogen atoms to which it is attached, forms a fused 6 membered aromatic ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In alternative, preferred embodiments, the tumour growth restricting agent will be an agent directed against hypoxia-inducible factor-1 HIF-1), in particular an agent which disrupts the expression or activity of H-1. HIF-1 is a transcription factor responsible for sensing hypoxia, and switching on hypoxia-inducible genes that stimulate the production of tumour blood vessels.) This may conveniently be achieved by anti-sense therapy, and in particular by the administration of an expression vector encoding an anti-sense version of HIF-1. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, a method of the invention comprises administration of the immunotherapeutic agent B7.1 or an expression vector encoding it, in combination with administration of an expression vector encoding an anti-sense version of HIF-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Other tumour growth restricting agents which may also be used include reagents which target the &agr;v&bgr;3 integrin and associated proteins, endostatin protein and cDNA, angiostatin cDNA, IL-12 cDNA, anti-sense constructs which target the VEGF&apos;s and their receptors Klk-1 and Flt-1, angiogenin, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and calreticulin. Other anti-angiogenic reagents which can be used in the methods of the present invention include cell permeable proteins such as VHL-carrier peptide, or anti-HIF scFv-carrier peptides that inhibit hypoxia-inducible pathways or integrin &bgr;-3 cytoplasmic domain-carrier peptides that disrupt the integrin &agr;V&bgr;3 required for angiogenesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The immunotherapeutic agent and the tumour growth restricting agent may be administered in any suitable form, using formulations for each agent already known in the art. The administrable form and dosage required will depend on the particular immunotherapeutic agent and tumour growth restricting agent chosen for use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For example, when the tumour growth restricting agent is DMXAA, the DMXAA is preferably administered at the lowest effective dose. In a particularly preferred embodiment, DMXAA is injected directly into the tumour tissue. The applicants have also found in this regard that injection of DMXAA directly into the tumour can reduce the effective dose required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The applicants have also found that a further tumour growth restricting agent (particularly an anti-angiogenic agent) can advantageously be administered in addition to the immunotherapeutic agent and first tumour growth restricting agent, to provide an additive therapeutic effect. For example, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, administration of an expression vector encoding the immunotherapeutic agent B7.1 and the tumour growth restricting agent DMXAA is combined with anti-sense therapy against HIF-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Also, when the tumour growth restricting agent is DMXAA and this is injected directly into the tumour, it is preferred that another less toxic anti-angiogenic reagent be administered simultaneously and systemically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Aspects of the invention will now be described with reference to the following experimental section which is exemplary only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Experimental </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Materials and Methods </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Mice and Cell Lines </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Female C57BL/6 mice, 6-9 weeks old, were obtained from the Animal Resource Unit, School of Medicine and Health Science, University of Auckland, Auckland. The EL-4 thymic lymphoma and mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLC) (H-2b) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md). These cell lines were cultured in vitro at 37&deg; C. in DMEM medium (Gibco BRL), supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Experimental Tumour Model. Tumours were established by subcutaneous injection of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>EL-4 and LLC cells into the left flank of mice, and growth determined by measuring two perpendicular diameters. Animals were euthanised when tumours reached more than 1 cm in diameter, in accord with Animal Ethics Approval (University of Auckland). EL-4 and LLC tumours reached 0.6-0.9 cm in diameter after approximately 21 and 14 days, respectively. All experiments included 5 or 6 mice per treatment group, and each experiment was repeated at least once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Administration FAA and DMXAA Analogues. FAA was gifted from the Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Drug Synthesis &amp; Chemistry laboratory, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, USA. The sodium salt of DMXAA was synthesized in the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, School of Medicine and Health Science, University of Auckland. Solutions of FAA and DMXAA in 5% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate and water, respectively, were prepared fresh for each experiment and protected from light. FAA and DMXAA were injected i.p. at 300 mg/Kg and 25 mg/Kg of body weight in a volume of 0.01 ml/g body weight, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Gene Transfer of B7.1. Complementary DNA encoding full-length human VCAM-1 was purchased from R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK; human B7.2 (Freemen et al, 1993) was provided by Dr. G. Freeman, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Md; human ICAM-1 was donated by Dr. J. Ni, Human Genome Sciences Inc., Rockville, Md.; mouse B7.1 (Chen et a 1992) was provided by Dr P. Linsley, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Seattle, Wash. We have previously reported the cloning and characterization of human MAdCAM-1 cDNA (Leung et al, 1996). The CAM pCDM8 expression vectors were prepared by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, and diluted to 600 &mgr;g/ml in a solution of 5% glucose in 0.01% Triton X-100. They were mixed in a ratio of 1:3 (wt:wt) with DOTAP cationic liposomes (boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Tumours were injected with 100 &mgr;l of DNA (60 ug)/liposome complexes, unless otherwise stated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Combining B7.1-mediated Immunotherapy with FAA/DMXAA-Medicated Vasculature Attack. Tumours, 0.6 to 0.9 cm in diameter, were injected at multiple sites with 100 &mgr;l of DNA (60 &mgr;g)/liposome complexes. Twenty-four hours later, DMXAA or FAA were administered i.p. as described above. Treated mice that remained tumour-free were rechallenged 6 weeks after administration of FAA or DMXAA and B7.1, by s.c. injection of EL-4 cells and LLC cells (0.1 ml) in the opposing flank (right flank). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Measurement of the Generation of Anti-Tumour CTL. Splenocytes were harvested 21, and 42 days following initial gene transfer, and 22 days following a parental tumour challenge. They were incubated at 37C with EL-4 target cells in graded E:T ratios in 96-well round-bottom plates. After a 4-hour incubation, 50 &mgr;l of supernatant was collected, and lysis was measured using the Cyto Tox 96 Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, Wis., USA). Background controls for non-specific target and effector cell lysis was calculated using the formula: 100&times;(experimental-spontaneous effector-target spontaneous target/maximum target-spontaneous target). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Adoptive Transfer of Anti-Tumour CTL. Adoptive transfer of Anti-tumour splenocytes was as described previously (Kanwar et al, 1999). Briefly, splenocytes obtained from mice 21 days following therapy were resuspended in Hank&apos;s balanced salt solution containing 1% FCS, and stimulated with 5 &mgr;g/ml PHA and 100 U/ml recombinant mouse IL-2 for 4 to 5 days. Animals bearing tumours 0.6 cm in diameter received both intratumoral and i.p. injections of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>cultured splenocytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Depletion of Leukocyte Subsets. Mice were depleted of CD8&plus;, and CD4&plus; T cells and NK cells by i.p. and i.v. injection 4 days prior to gene transfer, and thereafter every alternate day with 300 &mgr;g (0.1 ml) of the 53-6.72 (anti-CD8), Gk1.5 (anti-CD4), and PK136 (anti-NK) mAbs. Rat IgG (Sigma, USA) was used as a control antibody. Antibodies were an ammonium sulphate fraction of ascites, which titered to at least 1:2,000 by FACS (Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., Calif., USA) staining splenocytes. Depletion of individual leukocyte subsets was found to be more than 90% effective, as determined by FACScan analysis. Rat hybridomas secreting mAbs against mouse CD8 (53-6.72 mAb), CD4 (Gk1.5 mAb), and NK cells (Pk136 mAb) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., USA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In Situ Detection of Apoptotic Cells. Tumours were excised and immediately frozen in dry ice, stored at &minus;70&deg; C., and serial sections of 6 &mgr;m thickness prepared. TUNEL staining was performed using an In Situ apoptosis detection kit from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany. Briefly, frozen sections were fixed with paraformaldehyde solution (4% in PBS, pH 7.4), and permeabilized with a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate. After washing they were incubated with 20 &mgr;l TUNEL reagent for 60 min at 37&deg; C., and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Some slides were counterstained with propidium iodide (PI; Sigma, Calif., USA) to distinguish necrotic cells from those undergoing apoptosis. Adjacent sections were counterstained with haematoxylin and eosin and mounted. The total number of apoptotic or necrotic cells were counted. The apototic index (AI) or necrotic index (NI) was calculated as follows: AI or NI&equals;number of apoptotic or necrotic cells&times;100/total number of nucleated cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Immunohistology. Tumours were excised on the seventh day following administration of therapeutic agents and controls, immediately frozen in dry ice, stored at &minus;70&deg; C. in isopentane, and sections of 10 &mgr;m thickness prepared. Sections were mounted on poly L-lysine-coated slides, and endogenous peroxidases blocked by incubating slides for 30 min in 0.3% H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in methanol. Sections were stained with mouse anti-Hsp70 mAb (SPA-810 antibody; StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada) using a mouse-on-mouse immunodetection ABC Elite peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif., USA). They were developed with SIGMA FAST DAB (3,3&prime;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) with metal enhancer CoCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tablets, and counterstained with haematoxylin and eosin. As a control, the primary antibody was substituted with rat IgG (Sigma, USA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Statistical analysis. All experiments performed in vivo were repeated at least once with similar results obtained. Results were expressed as mean values&plus;standard deviation (S.D.), and a Student&apos;s test was used for evaluating statistical significance. A value of p&lt;0.05 denotes statistical significance, whereas p&lt;0.001 denotes results that are highly significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> CAM Gene Monotherapy is Unable to Check the Growth of Large Tumours. EL-4 cells (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>) subcutaneously implanted into ice grow rapidly, forming a solid tumour 1 cm in diameter with 4 weeks. We have previously demonstrated that small EL-4 tumours (0.1-0.3 cm diameter) transfected in situ with B7.1, B7.2, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 cDNA failed to grow, and mice remained tumour-free for at least two months (Kanwar et al, 1999). In contrast, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, larger tumours (&gt;0.5 cm) are refractory to treatment in response to B7.1 and several other costimulatory CAMs. Tumour growth is slowed, but ultimately the tumour grows unchecked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> DMXAA and FAA are Unable to Check the Growth of Large Tumours. Systemic administration of optimal doses of DMXAA and FAA to mice bearing large EL-4 tumours (0.6-0.8 cm in diameter) led to immediate reductions in the sizes of tumours (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), accompanied by marked tumour necrosis (refer below). DMXAA was the more potent of the two reagents, causing tumors to shrink to 0.1-0.2 cm over a period of 3 weeks, whereas the tumours of FAA-treated animals were reduced to 0.2-0.4 cm in diameter. However, tumours began to grow unchecked by day 28 and animals had to be sacrificed during the sixth week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Combined Therapy by Timed Delivery of B7.1 and DMXAA/FAA Eradicates Large Tumours. We hypothesized that simultaneous administration of the B7.1 pCDM8 expression vector and DMXAA/FAA might impair CAM-mediated anti-tumour immunity, as dying and necrotic tumour cells would not be able to adequately express B7.1. This notion proved correct, and hence established tumours (0.6-0.8 cm in diameter) were first treated with B7.1 to stimulate anti-tumour immunity, and DMXAA and FAA were administered one day later to retard tumour growth. Remarkably, tumours rapidly diminished in response to the combination of B7.1 and DMXAA accompanied by massive necrosis, such that by the third week of treatment tumours had completely disappeared (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The gross tumours of DMXAA-B7.1-treated animals took on the appearance of a wound that rapidly healed forming a scab that eventually flaked off leaving perfectly healed skin. Unlike B7.1 treatment, which leaves what appears to be a palpable fibrotic core, the tumour sites of DMXAA-B7.1-treated animals were completely healed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Similar results were obtained with the combination of FAA and B7.1, although tumours did not completely disappear until the sixth week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Combined Therapy Generates Potent and Prolonged Tumour-Specific Cytolytic T cell Activity. The anti-tumour CTL activity of splenocytes obtained from treated mice, 21 days following gene transfer, was significantly (p&lt;0.001) augmented in animals treated with the combination of B7.1 and DMXAA, and slightly enhanced with the combination of B7.1 and FAA, versus those receiving B7.1 monotherapy (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). In contrast DMXAA and FAA alone were very poor effectors, though they did enhance CTL production above that seen with empty vector and liposome controls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Animals previously cured by combination therapy completely rejected the substantial challenge of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>parental tumour cells for the 40 days they were monitored (FIG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, Table 1). Both DMXAA-B7.1 and FAA-B7.1 therapy provided complete protection, indicating that potent systemic anti-tumour immunity had been achieved. Anti-tumour CTL activity was still very strong 42 days following initial treatment with DMXAA-B7.1, and was stimulated further following the rechallenge with parental tumour cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> We have previously reported that adoptive transfer of splenocytes, from mice whose tumors had been treated with B7.1, leads to eradication of tumours in recipients(Kanwar et al, 1999). In accord, adoptive transfer of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>splenocytes from B7.1-DMXAA and B7.1-FAA treated mice into recipients bearing established EL-4 tumours (up to 0.8 cm in diameter) resulted in rapid and complete tumour regression (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Tumours larger than 0.8 cm in diameter were refractory to such treatment. In contrast, splenocytes from DMXAA or empty vector treated mice displayed no detectable anti-tumour activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Composition of the Leukocyte Effector Population. In vivo antibody blocking studies revealed that the primary rejection of tumours in response to either combined DMXAA-B7.1 or FAA-B7.1 therapy was very dependent on the presence of CD8&plus; T cells and NK cells, but only partially dependent on CD4&plus; T cells. Simultanious depletion of either CD8&plus; T cells and NK cells; CD4&plus; and CD8&plus; T cells; or CD4&plus;/CD8&plus; T cells and NK cells, severely impaired anti-tumour immunity leading to rapid tumour growth (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Anti-Tumour Immunity is Tumour-Specific. Similar results to the above have been obtained with the weakly immunogenic LLC. Thus, combinational B7.1-DMXAA therapy completely cured mice of subcutaneous LLC, and generated anti-tumour systemic immunity that protected all mice against a challenge with 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>parental tumour cells, and 80% of mice cured of EL-4 tumours were unable to resist a challenge of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>LLC cells, and vice versa mice cured of LLC were not protected against a challenge with 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>EL-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> cells; demonstrating that anti-tumour immunity is tumour-specific. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Gene Dosage Effect. Both FAA and DMXAA have an unusual &lsquo;threshold&rsquo; behavior in which only a very narrow range of high doses (22.5-25 mg/Kg body weight) are active, and acceptable in terms of toxicity (Baguley et al, 1993; Pedley et al, 1996). Further, we have previously reported that B7.1 and other costimulatory CAMs display a restrictive gene dosage effect, such that gene transfer of 60 &mgr;g of B7.1/pCDM<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> expression plasmid is optimal, whereas lesser or greater amounts are much less effective (Kanwar et al, 1999). To investigate whether a high gene dosage would impair combination therapy, tumours were injected with varying amounts (90-180 &mgr;g) of B7.1/pCDM8 plasmid followed by administration of an optimal dose of DMXAA (25 mg/Kg) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). All mice rapidly rejected their tumours, and a rechallenge of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>parental EL-4 cells. Thus an identical outcome is achieved with a broad high dose range of the therapeutic gene and an optimal dose of DMXAA. In contrast, when the DMXAA concentration was suboptimal, a gene dosage effect is clearly evident, such that only large amounts (180 &mgr;g) of B7.1/pCDM8 expression plasmid could generate effective anti-tumour immunity (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Mechanisms for B7.1 and DMXAA-Mediated Tumour Regression. We have previously reported that CAM-mediated anti-tumour immunity is accompanied by augmented CTL activity involving both the perform and Fas-ligand pathways, suggesting that EL-4 cells are targeted to undergo immune-mediated programmed cell death) Kanwar et al, 1999). This notion was confirmed by TUNEL staining of tumour sections prepared 7, 14, and 21 days after B7.1 gene transfer. Sections were counterstained with PI, which stains only the DNA of necrotic cells, allowing necrotic versus apoptotic cells to be distinguished. B7.1 immunotherapy was accompanied by marked tumour cell apoptosis (green fluorescence) at day 7, which peaked 14 days following gene transfer, and was replace at day 21 by marked necrosis (orange fluoresence) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>). In contrast, there was a predominance of necrotic cells in tumour sections from DMXAA-treated mice, where very few apoptotic cells were present (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). Surprisingly, combination therapy increased the number of apoptotic cells compared to B7.1 monotherapy (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), while retaining the same degree of necrosis observed with DMXAA monotherapy. Untreated tumours showed no sign of necrosis and apoptotic cells were absent (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> We hypothesized that the small increase in the generation of CTL in response to DMXAA may be in indirect effect, caused by the generation of CTL in response to heat shock proteins upregulated on stressed and dying tumour cells. Indeed, heat shock protein 70 was consistently found upregulated on tumour cells either surrounding or within the vicinity of blood vessels (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). Similarly, hsp70 was upregulated in tumours treated with B7.1, although not necessarily in the vicinity of blood vessels. In contrast, there was no sign of heightened hsp70 expression in tumours treated with empty vector alone.

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Gene transfer of an expression plasmid encoding antisense HIF-1&agr; induces the rejection of established tumours EL-4 tumours of 0.1 cm in diameter were established in C57BL/6 mice, and injected with a DNA/liposome transfection vehicle containing 100 &mgr;g antisense HIF-1&agr; pcDNA3B plasmid DNA. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumour sections prepared 2 days following gene transfer, revealed antisense therapy resulted in almost the complete inhibition of HIF-1 expressed endogenously in growing tumours (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>). Tumour growth was monitored for 4 weeks following gene transfer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The pattern of growth was compared to mice treated with 100 &mgr;g of empty vector control. Tumours grew rapidly in the control group, reaching 1 cm in size 14-17 days following gene transfer, whereas tumours treated with the antisense HIF-1&agr; plasmid completely and rapidly regressed within one week of gene transfer. Mice remained tumour-free for a further 21 day period during which they were monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Antisense HIF-1&agr; therapy does not eradicate large tumours, but slows their growth </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> We have previously demonstrated that tumours become refractory to immunotherapy once they reach 0.3 cm in diameter.<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>To determine whether antisense HIF-1&agr; therapy was similarly ineffective against large tumours, EL-4 tumours of 0.4 cm in diameter were established, and treated with 100 &mgr;g antisense HIF-1&agr; expression plasmid. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, none of the mice rejected their tumours, albeit there was a significant (P&lt;0.01) inhibition of tumour growth. All tumours eventually reached 1 cm in diameter within 2 weeks, and mice had to be euthanased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Vascular attack by antisense HIF-1&agr; synergizes with B7-1 immunotherapy to eradicate large tumours </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Here we consider the possibility that an anti-HIF-1&agr; reagent might be a suitable anti-angiogenic substitute for DMXAA in combination therapy. As reported previously<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, gene transfer of a B7-1 expression plasmid into small tumours (0.1 cm in diameter) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) led to complete tumour eradication within one week of gene transfer. There was no significant difference between the growth pattern of tumours treated with B7-1 and antisense HIF-1&agr; (P&gt;0.05). In contrast, large tumours (0.4 cm diameter) were intractable to treatment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), as had been the case with antisense HIF-1&agr; therapy. The failure of B7-1 therapy is not the result of poor transfection efficiency as B7-1 gene transfer led to expression of B7-1 in 90% of tumour cells, as reported in previous work.<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>For combination therapy, 0.4 cm diameter tumours were first injected with DNA/liposome complexes containing 100 &mgr;g B7-1, followed 48 h later by 100 &mgr;g antisense HIF-1&agr; plasmids. Combined gene therapy led to complete tumour regression within 10 days, and mice remained tumour-free for 3 weeks (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). To determine whether systemic anti-tumour immunity had been generated, cured mice were rechallenged with 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>parental tumour cells. Such mice resisted the challenge, and remained tumour-free for at least 2 months. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As a control, B7-1 immunotherapy was combined with an expression plasmid encoding the HIF-1&agr; cDNA fragment inserted into pcDNA3 in a sense orientation. In marked contrast to the above results, sense HIF-1&agr; could not enhance the therapeutic efficacy of B7-1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), producing results that were not statistically )P&lt;0.05) different from empty vector treated control mice. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Given that HIF-1&agr; antisense down-regulated the expression of HIF-1&agr; in EL-4 tumour cells, we sought to determine whether the expression of downstream effectors such as VEGF was abolished. Expression of VEGF was specifically reduced in response to antisense HIF-1&agr; (FIG <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A, compare <highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, resulting in a statistically significant (P&lt;0.01) 30% reduction in tumour vessel density (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B and C</cross-reference>), compared to mock treatment with empty vector. In addition tumour blood vessels present after antisense HIF-1&agr; therapy were small and poorly formed. </paragraph>

The fragment was cloned into pGEMT (Promega Corporation), and then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Company) at BamHI and Xhol sites in sense orientation, and into pcDNA3B at XhoI and BamHI sites in an antisense orientation. The pcDNA3B expression vector is identical to pcDNA3, except the polylinker is reversed (Lehnert et al., unpublished). The expression plasmid B7-1-pCDM<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which contains a 1.2 kb cDNA fragment encoding full-length mouse B7-1 was constructed from a cDNA clone provided by Dr P Linsley, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Seattle, Wash., USA. </paragraph>

Tumours were established by injection of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>EL-4 tumour cells into the right flank of mice, and growth determined by measuring two perpendicular diameters. Animals were killed when tumours reached more than 1 cm in diameter, in accord with Animal Ethics Approval (University of Auckland). Tumours reached 0.1 cm and 0.4 cm in diameter after approximately 14-18 days, and were injected with 100 &mgr;l expression plasmid (100 &mgr;g). For combinational treatment, reagents were delivered in a timed fashion, as described above for B7-1/DMXAA combination therapy. Thus, B7-1 cDNA was injected first, followed by HIF antisense cDNA 48 h later. Empty vectors served as control reagents. Cured mice were rechallenged 3 weeks after the disappearance of tumours by injecting 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>EL-4 cells subcutaneously into the opposing flank (left flank). All experiments included 6 mice per group, and each experiment was repeated at least once. Results were expressed as mean values &plusmn;standard deviation (s.d.), and a Student&apos;s t test was used for evaluating statistical significance. A value less than 0.05 (P&lt;0.05) denotes statistical significance. </paragraph>
