<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hard disk drive of the type that includes separate read and write head elements. More specifically the present invention concerns an improved disk drive adapted to overcome read errors due to variations in inter-element spacing, that is, the separation between read and write head elements. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a plan view of a conventional disk drive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with cover removed. The hard disk drive includes a stack of magnetic platters of which uppermost platter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is visible. Each platter comprises a rotatable storage disk operatively rotated at a constant speed of several thousand rpm by a spindle motor (not shown). Platter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> typically comprises a disk substrate having a surface on which a magnetic material is deposited. Digital data is stored on the disk as a series of variations in magnetic orientation of the disk&apos;s magnetic material. The variations in magnetic orientation, generally comprising reversals of magnetic flux, represent binary digits of ones and zeroes that in turn represent data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Data is written to and read from concentric tracks on each magnetic platter by read/write head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which includes a magneto-resistive (MR) head assembly. The MR head assembly produces, and detects, variations in magnetic orientation of the magnetic material as the disk rotates in order to write to and read from the track. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> it will be observed that the read element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the write element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are separated by an inter-element distance L. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a further read-write head assembly in which the inter-element separation is narrower than in the head assembly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The inter-element separation is narrower due to the manufacturing processes used to produce MR head assemblies. As a result the distance between the read and write elements of different units often varies so that the inter-element distance may decrease, for example to L-&Dgr;d, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As will be explained, variation in the inter-element distance leads to difficulties in reading data from the tracks so that the read bit error rate increases thereby necessitating read retries and reducing data transfer rate from the disk drive. It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method that addresses this problem. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, circuit board <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> contains signal processing and control circuitry as will be explained later with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Read/write head <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is supported by a slider <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which glides over the surface of platter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Slider <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is coupled to an actuator arm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which rotates about pivot assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The actuator arm is biased about the pivot by spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> against the action of a voice coil motor located beneath plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Modern disk drive architectures generally utilize an embedded servo system in which each data track is divided into a number of data sectors for storing fixed sized data blocks, one per sector. In addition, associated with the data sectors are a series of servo frames that are generally equally spaced around the circumference of the data track. The servo frames can be arranged between data sectors or arranged independently of the data sectors such that the servo frames split data fields of the data sectors, as is well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Typically each servo frame is radially aligned with corresponding servo frames of neighboring data tracks to form a set of radially extending, spoke-like servo sections that are equally spaced from one another around the circumference of the disk surface. However, when data are recorded in a zone bit arrangement, the number of data sectors within one rotation of a disk varies from zone to zone, thus causing the precise locations of servo frames of the spoke-like sections, relative to the data fields of the data sectors, to vary from zone-to-zone and within a zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a servo frame sequence consisting of; firstly a Servo Mark, an AGC data field which may be used to set read sensitivity, an ID Data field which typically comprises digital data encoded with a grey code identifying the track number, and a Position Error Signal (PES) Field consisting of four position bursts. The position bursts generally consist of one or more cycles of continuous carrier spanning the track to be followed and adjacent tracks on either side. Following the servo bit sequence there a DC gap (not shown) after which user data is written to form a data sector as will be explained later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is depicted a block diagram of a typical hard-disk controller. The controller includes a bi-directional preamplifier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which is coupled to a read/write channel circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The read/write channel circuit contains AGC circuitry for normalizing the output from preamplifier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Read/write channel circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also includes demodulator circuitry for converting the analog signal from the read/write head <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> into a digital signal suitable for processing by processor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The processor controls a positioning driver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which provides positioning currents to voice coil motor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. By means of spindle driver <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, microprocessor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> also controls spindle motor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which is rotatably coupled to platter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. An interface controller module <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided to facilitate data communications between the hard disk and external computational devices such as a host computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Read/write channel circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also sends data signals to preamplifier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The write amplifier is configured to drive the write element of read/write head <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in response to signals from preamplifier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> thereby converting the data signals into magnetic dipoles on the surface of the platter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Data segments of each track are typically encoded according to an error correcting code (ECC) which is decoded by channel circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Channel circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also includes logic circuits for detecting the servo mark fields of servo frames and for generating a servo gate signal when the servo mark of a data sector that is being searched for is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> the sequence of events in writing data to a data sector following a servo frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts schematically a track <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> moving in the direction indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> beneath read and write elements <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Read and write elements <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are electrically coupled to a controller comprising the system described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. As the track moves beneath read head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> the controller detects servo marker <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and decodes the ID Data in the servo frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The controller generates a SERVO_GATE flag upon determining that the ID Data corresponds to that of the servo frame that is being searched for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, after asserting the SERVO_GATE signal the controller waits for a write gate delay period to elapse before asserting a WRITE_GATE signal which initiates writing to the track. At the end of the write gate delay period the write head element is located at a distance Sw <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the servo marker. The commencement of writing causes a splice transient <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which is an unwanted artifact that is unavoidable. A DC Gap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is left between the end of the servo frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the splice transient <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, after the splice transient has settled a PLL Field <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is written. The PLL Field is used by the controller during read operations to lock it to the read frequency for the zone thereby enabling correct reading of following user data. The user data <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is written after the end of the PLL Field <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The sequence of events in reading data from the track will now be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Track <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> rotates under the read and write head elements <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> until the servo marker <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for servo frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is detected by controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Once the servo marker is detected and the ID Data field of sector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has verified the servo frame as being the one sought, then the controller asserts a SERVO_GATE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, after asserting the SERVO_GATE signal the controller waits for a write gate delay period to elapse before asserting a READ_GATE signal which initiates reading from the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At the end of the read gate delay period the read head element is located at a distance Sr <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from the servo marker. It will noted that the gate delay period is sufficient for the track to move so that reading commences at the beginning of PLL Field <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and after the splice transient <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has settled. The controller locks onto the read frequency signal from the PLL Field and then reads the user data <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Statistically the present inventors have found that in any batch of MR head assemblies most will have about the same inter-element separation. However, there will be a variation so that some will have a narrower separation and some will have a wider separation. The variation is due to manufacturing processes. Units incorporating MR head assemblies in which the inter-element separation varies significantly from the usual separation are subject to read errors as will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> are similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> except that the distance between the read and write elements is narrowed by an amount &Dgr;d to L-&Dgr;d. The narrowing of the inter-element separation results in the writing operation commencing a distance &Dgr;d further away from the end of servo frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as indicated by double-headed arrow <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, during a read operation the controller detects servo frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as previously described and waits for the read gate delay period to elapse before commencing reading. At the end of the read gate delay period the servo marker has moved a distance Sr downstream from the read head. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> however, the distance Sr is insufficient as reading commences during the DC Gap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This is because Gap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has lengthened due to the narrowed spacing between the read and write head elements. The controller starts to lock onto the DC Gap expecting that the read head is over the PLL Field <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Upon the read head coming adjacent splice transient <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> the controller will be thrown out of lock and may not recover until after the PLL Field has passed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Accordingly a number of retries may be required before lock is correctly acquired and the user data is correctly read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the case where the inter-element separation is wider, rather than narrower, the DC Gap will be shorter than expected and the reading operation may commence towards the end of the PLL Field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In that case there may not be a sufficient duration of PLL Field signal for the controller to lock so that it is able to correctly read the user data field <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Once again a number of retries may be required before the user data is correctly read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a hard disk drive according to an embodiment of the present invention. Controller <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes a memory device <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> which implements a register that records the optimum read gate delay for each zone. Alternatively the register may be implemented by means of standard on-board memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The optimum read gate delay for each zone is determined by measuring the inter-element separation using the standard error rate monitoring function of the read/write channel chip, as will now be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. As a result the read delay is optimized so that at the end of the read gate delay read head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is located a distance S<highlight><subscript>ropt </subscript></highlight>from servo marker <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and is correctly positioned over the start of PLL Field <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the time that reading commences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flowchart of a method, according to an embodiment of the present invention, for determining an optimal read gate delay for each zone. (Where a zoned bit data arrangement is not used the register may record the optimum read gate delay for each track.) Initially at step <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> an initial zone for processing is selected. Then at step <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> a predetermined test bit pattern is written to the data sector of the zone. At step <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> a counter variable j is initialized to zero. At step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> read gate delay variable RGD<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is set to MIN&plus;j&times;&Dgr;T where MIN is a delay value that corresponds to the narrowest inter-element separation that might feasibly occur and &Dgr;T is a small delay value. At step <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> the test bit pattern is read using the current RGD<highlight><subscript>ij </subscript></highlight>and at step <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> a bit error rate (BER) calculated and stored in variable BER<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. The BER is a parameter that is dependent on the inter-element spacing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> the test bit pattern is read and a bit error rate (BER) is calculated and assigned to variable BER<highlight><subscript>j</subscript></highlight>. BER<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is recorded in a data array against the value of RGD<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>at step <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> RGD<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is compared to a constant MAX which is a maximum read gate delay value corresponding to the widest inter-element separation that might feasibly occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> If RGD<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is less than the MAX value then control diverts to step <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> where counter variable j is incremented thereby increasing the value of RGD<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>at step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The procedure loops through step <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for j&equals;1, . . . ,n until RGD<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>is greater than or equal to MAX at step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Control then diverts to step <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> a search of the array is performed to locate RGD<highlight><subscript>opt </subscript></highlight>being the RGD<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>having the lowest corresponding BER. That value is recorded in register <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) as being the optimal read gate delay RGD<highlight><subscript>opt </subscript></highlight>for the current zone. The procedure is then repeated via steps <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> until the optimal read gate delay has been recorded in register <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for each zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The above method is implemented in software or firmware that may be stored in memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The instructions that implement each of the steps of the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> may be coded in any suitable computational language for execution by processor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and form a computer program product. The computer program product is stored on a computer readable memory, either in an integrated circuit memory device, for example memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as mentioned above, or externally on a passive substrate such as a magnetic or optical media, and is executable by a processor controlling the hard disk drive. The processor may be onboard processor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or it may be a processor in a host computer that is interfaced to the hard disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, during a read operation at the point that the controller sets the gate delay period the gate delay is obtained by looking up the value of RGD<highlight><subscript>opt </subscript></highlight>corresponding to the current zone. The values stored in register <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> will vary from disk drive to disk drive depending on the inter-element separation of the head assembly in each particular disk drive unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> It will be realized that while the method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is most convenient other methods for calculating the optimal read gate delay for each zone might be employed. For example one alternative approach would be to commence reading shortly after the servo frame and to measure the time period to the detection of the following splice transient. The read gate delay could then be set to correspond to a the measured time period plus a time sufficient to accommodate passing of the splice transient beneath the read head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Other methods based on directly measuring the inter-element separation might also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It will be realized that where the inter-element spacing is estimated the optimal read gate delay may be calculated as a function of the inter-element spacing, the rate of rotation of the platters of the hard disk drive and the radial position at which the read operation is taking place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is to be expressly understood that the claimed invention is not to be limited to the description of the preferred embodiment but encompasses other modifications and alterations within the scope of the inventive concept. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the foregoing disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made within the principles of the present invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed. Although the preferred embodiment described herein is directed to a disk drive for a personal computer, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the teaching of the present invention can be applied to other systems without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
