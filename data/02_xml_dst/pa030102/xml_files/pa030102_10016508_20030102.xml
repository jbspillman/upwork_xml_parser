<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This disclosure relates generally to labeling systems, and in particular but not exclusively, relates to a system for accurately labeling components of a device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Most complex devices consist of a number of components and sub-components located within the device. In some cases, it is important to be able to uniquely identify one or more of the components within the device. For example, computers are often linked to each other by networks. To enable the network link, each computer has a network card that allows it to be hooked up to the network and allows it to communicate with other computers on the network. Within each network, each network card located inside the computer must have a unique identification number, so that messages routed or sent to a particular computer can be properly routed to the address, the address consisting of the unique identification number of the access card. If there is more than one access card with the same identification number in a network, it can lead to misrouted mail, confusion among users, or complete paralysis and shut down of the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Because of the importance of uniquely identifying the address of each network card, it is very important that the identification number for each network card be accurately entered by, for example, network administrators into a database such as a routing table that will then allow messages or other network traffic to be directed to the proper computer. At present, the unique identification number each access card is somehow printed on the outside of the device into which they are incorporated. Usually, when the network card is manufactured, a series of labels are printed out and inserted into the bag in which the network card is packed for shipment to the customer who then puts together the larger device. The labels are usually printed out in large numbers, and then simply dropped inside the shipping container in which the network cards are sent to the laptop manufacturers. This, of course, can lead to the wrong label being inserted into the bag with each network card, meaning that the wrong code numbers will end up in the databases and can lead to the network into which the network card is installed not working properly.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of an apparatus and method for accurately labeling components of a device are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Reference throughout this specification to &ldquo;one embodiment&rdquo; or &ldquo;an embodiment&rdquo; means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrases &ldquo;in one embodiment&rdquo; or &ldquo;in an embodiment&rdquo; in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics can be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for accurately labeling a component such as a network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that forms part of a device such as a laptop computer. Most computers include a network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that allows them to connect to a network and communicate with other computers in the network. Each network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a network conforming to the IEEE <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> standard has an identifier known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address electronically encoded in its circuitry. The MAC address is a hardware address that uniquely identifies each node of a network. In any network, each network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> must have a unique MAC address, otherwise the network server will be unable to differentiate between the different computers hooked up to the network. In addition to each network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having its own MAC address, each MAC address must be accurately recorded in databases, routing tables and the like; even if all the network cards <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a network have unique MAC addresses, duplicate MAC addresses in databases or routing tables can result in severe network problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a reader <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> connected to, and in communication with, a computer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is in turn connected to, and in communication with, a printer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> capable of printing labels, such as adhesive labels. The reader <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is capable of reading the MAC address from the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and transmitting it to the computer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> receives the MAC address input from the reader <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and transmits it to the printer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The printer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in turn prints the MAC address of the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on a pair of labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Although this embodiment of the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is described in the context of a network card for laptop computer, the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be used for other components and devices as well, or in any situation in where labeling must accurately identify the contents of a container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In operation, the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> passes by and/or is inserted into the reader <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so that the MAC address encoded therein can be read. Once the MAC address is read from the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the reader transmits the MAC address to the computer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which converts the MAC address into appropriate printer instructions and transmits those instructions to the printer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The printer prints a pair of labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, each bearing the MAC address of the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Once printed, the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are removed from the printer and affixed to a container, such as electrostatic discharge (ESD) bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, into which the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will be inserted for shipping, and from which the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will later be removed for installation in a computer. In one embodiment, the two labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are removed from the printer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and affixed to an area of the electrostatic discharge (ESD) bag designated to receive the labels. In another embodiment, the MAC address labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be affixed to a base label already attached to the ESD bag, or can be an integral part of a base label (e.g., a warning label) that is run through the printer to print the MAC address labels. The labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are affixed to the base label in an area of the base label designated to receive them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of a base label <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that can be attached to the ESD bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The base label <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises an informational portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a portion comprising the two labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that have the MAC address printed thereon. Both labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are removably affixed to the base label <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in a designated area below the informational portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The exact appearance of the informational portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will depend upon the particular application to which the labels will be put. As shown, the informational portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is an electrostatic discharge warning, and the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> contain the MAC address of the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in Arabic numerals and a bar code, although the MAC address can also be printed on the labels in other forms, such as two-dimensional bar codes, alphanumeric codes, and the like. In other embodiments, the informational portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can have some other warning or information printed thereon, and the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can have other identifiers printed thereon. In the embodiment shown, both labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are identical, although in other embodiments they can be different. For example, the MAC address might be printed on one label in barcode only and on the other label in Arabic numerals only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The labels <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be made using paper, plastic, or any other material on which the MAC address can be printed. Preferably, they are made using a flexible fabric, such as polyester, so that they can easily conform to the changing shape of the underlying ESD bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to which it is attached. This prevents detachment of the label from the bag. The base label <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the ESD bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> with adhesives pre-applied to the backsides of the base label, while the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are attached to the base label <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with an adhesive that will allow the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to be removed from the ESD bag for later affixation elsewhere. Although two labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are illustrated in this embodiment, in other embodiments more than two labels can be used, depending on the number of places the MAC address of the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> must be accurately displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The MAC address printed on each label <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> uniquely identifies and corresponds to the MAC address of the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> stored on the inside of the ESD bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. By reading the MAC address directly from the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, immediately printing the MAC address on the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and immediately placing those labels on the ESD bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, accurate identification of the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and display of its MAC address is assured. This represents an improvement over the prior art, in which large number of labels were printed out en masse, and then simply deposited on the inside of the ESD bag when the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> was inserted therein. With the prior art, there is high potential for mixing up the labels, meaning that there is no assurance that the number on the label inserted in the bag will correspond to the MAC address of the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates use of the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> upon their removal from the base label <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on the ESD bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. When the manufacturer of a device such as laptop computer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> receives the ESD bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> containing the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is removed from the ESD bag and installed in the proper slot in the interior of the laptop <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. As soon as the network card is installed on the laptop, the first label <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is removed from the exterior of the ESD bag and pasted on the exterior of the laptop <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. By having a label on the exterior of the laptop, the MAC address of the network card contained therein can be easily determined without having to open up the laptop, remove the network card, and read the MAC address therefrom. The second label <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is removed from the ESD bag <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and is affixed to the exterior of the shipping container <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in which the laptop <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> will be sent to the end user. By displaying the label <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> on the outside of the shipping container <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the end user need not even open the shipping container to determine the MAC address of the network card inside the laptop. Instead, the end user can read the MAC number directly from the exterior of the packing container and enter it into the proper databases or routing tables, so that laptop <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> will function with the network once installed. This is of particular advantage to end users who buy large numbers of computers, because it would be a large burden to unpack every computer to determine its MAC address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> There are, of course, many other ways the labels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be used. For example, the labels can be pasted or affixed in other locations. The general intent is to allow users to easily and accurately determine the MAC address of the network card inside the laptop without having to either unpack the laptop from its shipping container, or open up the laptop and extract the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As discussed above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there can also be more than two labels, depending on the number of places where it is necessary to display the MAC address of the network card <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> inside the laptop <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The above description of illustrated embodiments of the invention, including what is described in the Abstract, is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. While specific embodiments of, and examples for, the invention are described herein for illustrative purposes, various equivalent modifications are possible within the scope of the invention, as those skilled in the relevant art will recognize. These modifications can be made to the invention in light of the above detailed description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The terms used in the following claims should not be construed to limit the invention to the specific embodiments disclosed in the specification and the claims. Rather, the scope of the invention is to be determined entirely by the following claims, which are to be construed in accordance with established doctrines of claim interpretation. </paragraph>
