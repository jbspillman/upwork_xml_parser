<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to equipment dollies and particularly to dollies for transporting, lifting, and loading equipment onto raised or lowered receiving surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A forklift or crane is generally required to lift and load heavy equipment onto a &ldquo;receiving surface,&rdquo; such as a raised or lowered platform, loading dock, truck, train, flatbed trailer, any load-carrying vehicle, or any similar surface that could receive equipment. Lighter equipment, supplies, and walk-behind power tools, such as rototillers, concrete power trowels, and floor polishers (&ldquo;equipment&rdquo;), that do not require a crane or forklift may still be too heavy to be lifted onto a vehicle or raised platform by the average person. Walk-behind power tools typically have heavy components, such as internal combustion engines or electric motors connected to functional devices, such as blades. Concrete power trowels, for example, weigh 300-400 lbs. Even power tools that are lightweight enough to lift may be bulky and too cumbersome for one person to lift. For example, a lightweight lawn mower may require two or more people to lift and load it onto the bed of a pickup truck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Besides being too heavy or bulky to lift, equipment may be difficult to move or transport across the ground or floor. Although many walk-behind power tools such as lawn mowers and snow blowers have wheels so that they can be pushed along the ground, other walk-behind power tools have wheels that are designed for stable transport over only short distances. The wheels do not engage the ground unless a human operator maintains downward pressure on a handle to shift the weight of the tool from a pad or blade to the wheels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Furniture and appliance &ldquo;hand dollies&rdquo; provide one solution for moving equipment along surfaces, such as ground surfaces or stairs. Hand dollies alone, however, are unable to significantly raise and lower equipment onto a receiving surface. To move equipment with a furniture dolly to a receiving surface that is at a height significantly different from the ground surface requires a ramp or other suitable equipment. Although some trucks or perhaps loading docks may have built-in or permanent ramps, others do not. Makeshift ramps may be constructed from materials such as plywood, or no ramp at all is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,378 to Puls (the &ldquo;Puls reference&rdquo;) discloses a device that attaches to the front end of a snowmobile to assist in the movement or storage of the snowmobile. Although the Puls reference provides some lift provision, it cannot convey a snowmobile from one level to a significantly higher or lower receiving surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other devices that attempt to address the problem of lifting and loading equipment onto a receiving surface tend to rely on standard vertical forklift technology that simply raises and lowers equipment using hydraulic, mechanical, or other means. These forklift devices can also permit the movement of equipment over surfaces, but they are heavy, expensive, and difficult to transport. Therefore, these forklift devices are rarely available at small jobsites. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a lift and load dolly suitable lifting (or lowering) and loading equipment from a starting surface to a receiving surface. More specifically, the dolly is suitable for loading equipment onto the dolly, supporting the equipment on the dolly, transporting equipment on the dolly, and lifting or lowering equipment (either together with the dolly or by itself) from a starting surface onto a receiving surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A dolly of the present invention preferably includes a base frame and a slideable load bracket connected to the base frame. A power system may be used for extending and retracting the load bracket between an equipment-transfer mode, an equipment transport mode, and a weight-shift mode. The load bracket alone or the load bracket and the base frame are pivotable in relation to at least part of the front end of the base frame. Mobility-enabling devices and an operational member may also be connected to the base frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes methods for lifting and lowering equipment using the dolly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objectives, features, and advantages of the invention will be more readily understood upon consideration of the following detailed description of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a dolly, cart, or other device (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;dolly 100&rdquo;) suitable for loading equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) or supporting and transporting equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention is also suitable for lifting or lowering equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from a starting surface onto a receiving surface (FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). The equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be transferred onto the receiving surface either together with the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>) or by itself (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>). Power systems such as those shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be included to assist in the equipment-transfer process. In one preferred embodiment, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes mechanisms to support the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in an equipment-maintenance position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). The present invention also includes methods such as those set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A, 16B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for lifting or lowering equipment from a starting surface onto a receiving surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Structure: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention preferably includes a base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is movably connected with the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> substantially supports the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, particularly as it is lifted or lowered onto a receiving surface. At least one mobility-enabling device <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is attached to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to allow the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to be easily transported from one location to another. An operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may also be attached to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> allows the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to be controlled and maneuvered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown, the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the present invention has a top side <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a bottom side <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and a rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be a frame (as shown) or a solid piece. Additional bracing may be included for structural support. A load bracket immobilizer (not shown) may also be incorporated into the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to secure the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in one or more specific positions in relation to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The load bracket immobilizer may consist of one or more straps, clamps, hooks, springs, locks, or other mechanisms suitable for holding the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in one or more specific positions in relation to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The load bracket immobilizer may be used, for example, for providing extra securing means for when the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is tilted upward on a receiving surface with load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is extended beyond the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is movably connected with the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a leading end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> disposed toward the front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a following end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> opposite the leading end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be a solid piece (as shown) or a frame. If the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a frame, additional bracing may be included for structural support. One or more equipment positioner <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) may be included in the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to help correctly position the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the shown embodiments, the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is slidably connected with the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so that the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be slid along a track, rollers, tube, or other sliding means between an extended position beyond the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a retracted position substantially coextensive with the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The sliding may be smooth or incremental and may be powered by a power system (discussed below). Stoppers or other movement limiting mechanisms may be used to prevent the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> from extending too far. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An equipment immobilizer <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be incorporated into the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to secure the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The equipment immobilizer <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may consist of one or more straps, clamps, hooks, or other mechanisms suitable for securing the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The load bracket immobilizer discussed above may also be incorporated into the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (in addition to or instead of being incorporated in the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) to secure the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in a specific position in relation to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The shown dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a plurality of wheels as its mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> attached to the bottom side <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In one preferred embodiment, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the wheels may be pneumatic tires that allow the dolly to be used over varied terrain. In this embodiment the pneumatic tires are large enough to raise the bottom side <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> above the wheel wells inside the truck bed. This also enables the user to store additional items under the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may include other types of wheels or tires, locking casters, rollers, belts, treads, tracks, skids, skis, or other appropriate mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. It should also be noted that any number of mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be used (including only a single mobility-enabling device <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>). The size of the mobility-enabling device <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may also be varied depending on the intended purpose of the dolly. The mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are preferably attached so that they are can be steered and locked, but these features are optional. The placement of the mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may also be varied according to the intended function of the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> show one preferred embodiment of mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that can swivel 360 degrees, lock in place to prevent the dolly from moving (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), extend horizontally (to give the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> a wider wheelbase), and flatten (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> detail the connection of these mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. This connection, however, is meant to be exemplary and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The shown dolly also has an optional operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (shown as a control handle) attached to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</cross-reference> show a first preferred embodiment of the operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, shaped like an H, so that the handle of the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be placed between the upright members and secured to the cross-member for storage or maintenance. FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show a second preferred embodiment of the operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> shaped like a T. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 15</cross-reference> show a third preferred embodiment of the operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, shaped like a T, with an additional (possibly removable) cross-member. Using the additional cross-member or maintenance securer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of this embodiment, the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be tilted and then secured in the tilted or maintenance position. The first H-shaped embodiment could be used in a similar fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The optional operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be foldable, removable, or retractable. Further, the operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may not be included at all. This is particularly possible if the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has its own control handle that can be used to steer the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> when the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is secured to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Finally, it is possible that more than one operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be included. For example, if the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> could be extended beyond either the front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or the rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, then a user would not have to turn the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> around if there was an operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> at both the front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The feet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be wheels, casters, pads, or any other means of making a stable temporary contact with a receiving surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> show exemplary optional power systems for extending and retracting the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in relation to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The power system could be used at any time the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> was extended or retracted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows an exemplary two-winch, two-cable system in which one winch is the extender winch and one winch is the retractor winch. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an exemplary preferred embodiment of the power system that uses a geared train, a worm screw, and an electric motor for extending and retracting the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows another exemplary embodiment of a power system that uses a single winch, pulleys, cable, and an optional spring. Other power systems may include various combinations of motors, manual systems, winches, hand cranks, pistons, levers, or other power means. These power systems may move the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> using any combination of gears, chains, rods, belts, pulleys, cables, and other mechanical linkages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Other optional features may include built-in brackets and containers for holding tools.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference> shows one preferred method of using the present invention to load equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> onto the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, transport the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and lift the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (or the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> alone) from a lower surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (also referred to as a lower starting surface when the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is to be lifted) to a higher surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> (also referred to as a higher receiving surface when the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is to be lifted). This method assumes that the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, but any of the embodiments described above could use this method or a variation of this method. Some of the variations of the method are specifically set forth, and some would be obvious, based on the particular embodiments of the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the intended use of the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> One preferred method of loading <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on a dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> uses the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> that has the mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. In this method, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is configured in an equipment-transfer mode with horizontal, lowered, or flattened mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extended <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> beyond the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The equipment-transfer mode allows equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be easily pulled or pushed onto the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. It should be noted, that if the mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> cannot be lowered (such as those in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), alternative embodiments could include an integral ramp (not shown) in which a ramp is attached to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> so that the ramp can be slid, rotated, hinged, or otherwise extended beyond the front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to assist the user in loading the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> onto the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other means to assist the user in loading the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may also be included, or this feature could be optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Regardless of whether there are specific structural means incorporated in the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to assist the user in loading the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be configured in an equipment-transfer mode with the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extended beyond the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. If the mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are lowered sufficiently, the extended load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will substantially touch the ground so as to form a ramp. If the mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are not lowered at all or only lowered a few degrees, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be tilted forward (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) so that the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will form a ramp. The dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will not need to be configured in an equipment-transfer mode if the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is already loaded or if the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is to be lifted onto the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If it has not already been done, the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is then placed on the load bracket <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In some of the preferred embodiments, one or more optional positioners <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are used to help position the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In some of the preferred embodiments, the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is then secured <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> using the equipment immobilizer <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or other securing devices. The step of securing the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Once the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is on the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is then configured in an equipment transport mode <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) with the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> substantially coextensive with the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is preferably transportable <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> over a variety of surfaces and may be used to transport the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> about a job site or just positioned to where it is to be lifted or lowered onto a receiving surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> thereon, may then be used for lifting <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> alone (FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) or together with the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) from the lower starting surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</cross-reference>, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the equipment transport mode (with the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> substantially coextensive with the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) is then positioned in a receiving surface contact position <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. This may be done, for example, by pushing back on the operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to raise the front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> just above the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, transporting the tilted dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and then lowering the raised front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> until it rests on the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In the receiving surface contact position, at least part of the rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is put into contact with a lower starting surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and at least part of the front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is put into contact with a higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, at least one mobility-enabling device <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is used as the point of contact with the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In one preferred embodiment in which the mobility enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are wheels or casters, the mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are locked or secured to prevent them from rolling. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, at least one foot <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is used as the point of contact with the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (in phantom) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is then configured in a weight-shift mode <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, with the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extended beyond the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Throughout this step, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> remains substantially in the receiving surface contact position with at least part of the rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> remaining in contact with the lower starting surface <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and at least part of the second front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> remaining in contact with the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be extended using a power system. The weight-shift mode is designed to shift the center of gravity to allow easy pivoting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Once the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is configured in the weight-shift mode, the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may then be pivoted <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in relation to the front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. (This could also be described as being pivoted about the front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or being pivoted in relation to the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>.) As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 10</cross-reference>, the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be pivoted in conjunction with the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or the feet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> act as a pivot-point so that the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is lowered while simultaneously raising the rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> off the ground. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is pivoted alone. This embodiment may include a release mechanism, such as a latch (not shown), that releases the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> from sliding movement parallel to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so that the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may pivot in relation to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. After release, the leading end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is allowed to descend to the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The pivoting may be accomplished by means of a hinge <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> or other means of movably attaching the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. (A separate load bracket power system may be used to assist in this pivoting.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in one preferred embodiment, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are transported <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (generally by pushing or pulling the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) together onto the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. This step may be done after or simultaneously with the pivoting step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. This embodiment is particularly useful if the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be necessary for unloading at another site. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, once the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is on the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be optionally configured in the equipment transport mode <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> (with the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> substantially coextensive with the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) so that the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> takes up less room and is easy to transport and/or store. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the alternate preferred embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> alone may be transferred <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> from the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the higher receiving surface <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, after the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> have been pivoted <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, the rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may be supported either by a support brace <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), other support structure, or by the user or an assistant.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Equipment may include tools (e.g., rototillers, concrete power trowels, floor polishers, walk-behind power (or manual) tools, washers, dryers, refrigerators), vehicles (e.g., snowmobiles, motorcycles), supplies (e.g. boxed goods, loose supplies), or any equipment for which transport, lifting, and/or loading is desired. Although this invention was primarily designed for transporting equipment having unstable wheels or no wheels, the pneumatic wheels of one of the preferred embodiments allow easy transport over rough terrain, and therefore, the invention may be desirable for use even with equipment that has wheels suitable for normal transport but not suitable for rough terrain. Further, the lifting and loading capabilities of the present invention may be used with any type of equipment, although the size and strength of the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may have to be adapted for the size and weight of the equipment <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Alternate embodiments of the present invention are within the scope of the invention. For example, the various embodiments of the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be interchanged depending on the desired function of the dolly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Further, optional features such as the operational member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, maintenance securer <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, equipment immobilizer <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, equipment positioner <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, may be modified, omitted, or alternately positioned depending on their desired functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that terminology in this description is meant to assist in the understanding of the invention and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention. For example, the terms front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are meant to be relational. For example, if the load bracket <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be extended beyond the base frame <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in either direction, then these terms could be synonymous. Further, the term rear end <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may include any mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> attached thereto and the term front end <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> may include any mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or feet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> attached thereto. This is significant because the descriptions of the front and rear ends <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> contacting the starting and receiving surfaces may in fact have mobility-enabling devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or feet <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as the actual point of contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The terms and expressions that have been employed in the foregoing specification are used as terms of description, not of limitation, and are not intended to exclude equivalents of the features shown and described or portions of them. The scope of the invention is defined and limited only by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
