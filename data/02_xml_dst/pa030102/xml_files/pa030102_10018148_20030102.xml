<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a high-frequency current suppressor for suppressing high-frequency conduction noise in a signal transmission cable used for various electronic information equipment, such as a terminal equipment for mobile communication, an audio-visual equipment, or the like, and also to an earphone system using the high-frequency current suppressor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, various signal transmission cables are used for transmitting signals between devices or between components in various electronic information equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in various audio-visual equipment for enjoying music or movies, an earphone system including a signal transmission cable having a connection plug at its end, earphone or headphone is utilized to enable a user to enjoy music or movies without worrying about surrounding sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Further, an earphone system combining the above-described earphone or headphone for enjoying music etc. and a microphone has been used in recent years, for example, in a terminal equipment for mobile communication, such as a portable telephone, or the like. This makes hands-free communication available, namely makes it unnecessary for a user to hold the terminal equipment for mobile communication directly in his hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The earphone system including those earphones or headphones generally comprises a connection plug connected to an output terminal of a terminal equipment, an earphone or a headphone and/or a microphone, and a signal cable for connecting the connection plug with the earphone, or the like. A cable length of the signal cable ranges from several tens centimeters to a hundred and several tens centimeters. In addition, the cable length corresponds to order of wavelength in microwave band used for mobile communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, an output from antenna attached to a terminal equipment for mobile communication, such as a portable telephone, or the like is easily conducted to the signal cable of the earphone system due to electromagnetic coupling. As a result, electromagnetic wave is conducted to a head of the user through the signal cable. This sometimes increases localized SAR (absorbed electric power per specific weight) value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, electromagnetic waves produced from a terminal equipment for mobile communication or the like cause a problem in which an influence of the electromagnetic waves to a human body becomes serious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Various researches have been made in recent years as regards such an influence of the electromagnetic waves to a human body. It is sure that the influence would become serious problem more and more from now on in accordance with further popularization of the mobile communication equipment. In addition, unnecessary high-frequency noise (current) is sometimes conducted to a signal cable used for transmitting signals between devices or between components in various electronic information equipment. An erroneous operation of electronic information equipment is thereby caused to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a high-frequency current suppressor which is capable of being readily attached to a signal cable used for transmitting signals between devices or between components in various electronic information equipment and which can prevent the electronic information equipment from erroneous operations by reducing unnecessary high-frequency current conducted to the signal cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a high-frequency current suppressor which is capable of being readily attached to an earphone, a signal cable, or the like, and which can prevent electromagnetic wave from increasing SAR value in a human head by reducing unnecessary high-frequency current generated in the signal cable due to induction of the electromagnetic wave produced from a terminal equipment, and the like, and also to provide an earphone system using the high-frequency current suppressor. </paragraph>

Then, both ends of the cable are connected to the network analyzer, as the above-mentioned two ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, EXAMPLE 2 shows measuring effect of transmission characteristics by a network analyzer between two ports. In this measuring, the high-frequency current suppressor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> according to the fourth embodiment is attached to be fixed to the central portion of the cable, and then both ends of the cable are connected to the network analyzer, similarly to the EXAMPLE 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As will be understood from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, according to EXAMPLE 1 and EXAMPLE 2, suppressing effects between 25 dB and 35 dB can be obtained at quasi-microwave band in any high-frequency current suppressors <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Besides, other than the high-frequency current suppressors <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, alternative high-frequency current suppressors can be designed by changing material composition or size thereof. Accordingly, desirable suppressing characteristics can be obtained by adapting the material composition or the size of the high-frequency current suppressors to a cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Further, other than the high-frequency current suppressors according to the above-mentioned first through fourth embodiments, it will now be readily possible to put this invention into effect in various other manners. For example, a break <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> was formed to be a substantially straight line parallel to an axis of the cylindrical shape of the high-frequency current suppressors. The break can be formed to have an angle to the axis of the cylindrical shape. In addition, the break can be formed as a curve. Alternatively, the break can be composed of two edges interfitted to each other when the break is closed. In addition, shapes of the high-frequency current suppressors are not limited to the cylindrical shape. The high-frequency current suppressors can be formed to have a rectangular shape. Further, a member for preventing the cable from slipping or an adhesive layer can be provided at inner side of the cylindrical or the rectangular tube. </paragraph>

Furthermore, the flexible member comprises a break which elongates over all length along an axial direction of the cable. The high-frequency current suppressors <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can therefore be readily attached and fixed to a signal cable used for an earphone, a microphone, and the other electronic equipments. Excellent suppressing effects can be obtained at quasi-microwave band in any high-frequency current suppressors <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it is possible to provide a high-frequency current suppressor which can suppress unnecessary high-frequency current sufficiently and which is thereby effective to solve various EMI (electromagnetic interference) problems. It is also possible to prevent electromagnetic waves from increasing SAR value in a human head by applying the high-frequency current suppressor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to earphone, headphone or a signal cable connecting those to a terminal equipment for mobile communication. </paragraph>
