<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a prior art packet communication system described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-283804. Numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a transmission side terminal equipment, numeral <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> denotes a reception side terminal equipment, numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> denote A/D conversion circuits, numeral <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> denotes a packet assembly circuit, numeral <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> denotes a packet disassembly circuit, and numeral <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> denote D/A conversion circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In this packet communication system, the A/D conversion circuits <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are supplied with analog input signals ch<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(i), . . . , chX(i) which are input signals for the transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The analog input signals ch<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(i), . . . , chX(i) are mutually synchronized in A/D conversion timing in the transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The A/D conversion circuits <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> perform A/D conversion simultaneously on the supplied analog input signals ch<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(i), . . . , chX(i) respectively at periods T, and output resultant digital signals to the packet assembly circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The packet assembly circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provided in a stage subsequent to that of the A/D conversion circuits <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits a synchronization control packet to the reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at periods T, and notifies the reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of A/D conversion timing of the A/D conversion circuits <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Analog signal information (digital signal) obtained by A/D conversion conducted by the A/D conversion circuits <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is stored in as many information packets as required. In the wake of the synchronization control packet, the information packets are transmitted to the receiving side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For example, if input channels of the analog input signals ch<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(i), . . . , chX(i) are eight channels and two pieces of analog signal information (digital signal) are stored in one information packet, then four information packets are transmitted to the reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving a synchronization control packet, the packet disassembly circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> reproduces the A/D conversion timing of the transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, upon receiving information packets from the packet assembly circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the packet disassembly circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> takes out analog signal information (digital signal) included in the information packets, and delivers the analog signal information (digital signal) to a pertinent D/A conversion circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The D/A conversion circuits <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> provided in a stage subsequent to the packet disassembly circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> perform D/A conversion on respective analog signal information pieces (digital signals) in synchronism with an A/D conversion timing signal reproduced by the packet disassembly circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and output analog output signals ch<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>(o), . . . , chX(o) from analog signal output channels provided for the D/A conversion circuits <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in one-to-one correspondence. Owing to the operation heretofore described, a plurality of analog signals are transmitted from the transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> synchronously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When the prior art packet communication system is applied to a large scale packet communication system comprised of a plurality of transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, at least one reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and at least one relay equipment (such as an exchange equipment having an exchange function of N:N and a multiplexing equipment having a multiplexing and broadcast function of 1:N), there are the following problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To begin with, a first problem is that the transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the synchronization control packet to the reception side terminal equipment one-sidedly and consequently it is difficult to achieve timing synchronization between a plurality of transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and at least one reception side terminal equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a second problem is that in the case where packets directed to the same route and received by a relay equipment are subject to multi-relay in the order of arrival, multiplexing and demultiplexing are repeated every passage through a relay equipment, and arrival intervals of information packets fluctuates at each of the relay equipment and the reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. There is also a problem that a packet reception buffer having a large capacity becomes necessary in each of the relay equipments and the reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in order to cope with the fluctuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> And a third problem is that because of the above-mentioned fluctuation it is difficult to fix a maximum value of transmission delay time required since the transmission terminal equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits information packets until the reception terminal equipment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receives the information packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There is a problem that especially the second and third problems become further remarkable in the case where the transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has transmitted nonpreferential packets of best effort type and information packets mixedly, or in the case where the packet length is made not fixed but variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a packet communication system, a packet communication method, and a computer readable recording medium having a computer program for making a computer execute the method recorded thereon capable of reducing the capacity of the packet reception buffer and definitely assuring a maximum value of a transmission delay time of information packets. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A packet communication system according to the present invention is a packet communication system comprises: a plurality of terminal equipments that conduct communication operation at periodic timing; and relay equipments that relay packets given and received between said terminal equipments, wherein synchronization control packets for timing synchronization are transmitted between adjacent equipments to thereby establish synchronization of operation timing, each of said terminal equipments and relay equipments including a synchronization request unit which transmits a synchronization request packet to an adjacent equipment at own operation timing and thereby performs a synchronization request; a synchronization response unit which is responsive to acceptance of a synchronization request packet from said adjacent equipment, for transmitting a synchronization response packet corresponding to the synchronization request packet according to own synchronization timing and thereby conducting a synchronization response; a calculation unit which calculates a synchronization deviation value with respect to an adjacent equipment on the basis of a time difference between an arrival time of the synchronization response packet transmitted from said adjacent equipment and own operation timing; and a correction unit which corrects operation timing of the own equipment on the basis of the synchronization deviation value calculated by said calculation unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits a synchronization request packet to an adjacent equipment at its own operation timing and thereby conducts a synchronization request. When a synchronization request packet is accepted from the adjacent equipment, each of the terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits a synchronization response packet corresponding to the synchronization request packet according to its own synchronization timing and thereby conducts a synchronization response, calculates a synchronization deviation value with respect to an adjacent equipment on the basis of a time difference between an arrival time of the synchronization response packet transmitted from the adjacent equipment and own operation timing, and corrects the operation timing of the own equipment on the basis of the calculated synchronization deviation value. As a result, timing synchronization can be executed among a plurality of terminal equipments. The capacity of the packet reception buffer can be reduced. The maximum value of the transmission delay time of the information packets can be definitely assured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A packet communication system according to the next invention is wherein each of said terminal equipments comprises an information packet transmission unit which transmits information packets having a number and a length predetermined for each terminal equipment toward an opposite terminal equipment in the wake of the synchronization request, and each of said relay equipments comprises a storage unit which temporarily stores information packets received between the current operation timing and next operation timing; and a relay unit which relays information packets stored in said storage unit in the wake of the synchronization request packet at next operation timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the terminal equipments transmits information packets having a number and a length predetermined for each terminal equipment toward an opposite terminal equipment in the wake of the synchronization request, and each of the relay equipments temporarily stores information packets received between the current operation timing and the next operation timing, and relays information packets temporarily stored in the storage unit in the wake of the synchronization request packet at next operation timing. As a result, packet communication can be conducted efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A packet communication system according to the next invention is wherein each of said relay equipments further comprises an extraction unit which extracts only data portions of information packets received between current operation timing and next operation timing, when relaying information packets from an N side route of a 1:N multiplexing and broadcasting communication system to a 1 side route; and a packet generation unit which generates packets having data portions extracted by said extraction unit and arranged in a predetermined order, and said relay unit relays packets generated by said packet generation unit in the wake of the synchronization request packet at next operation timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the relay equipments extracts only data portions of information packets received between current operation timing and next operation timing, when relaying information packets from an N side route of a 1:N multiplexing and broadcasting communication system to a 1 side route, generates packets having data portions extracted by the extraction unit and arranged in a predetermined order, and relays the packets in the wake of the synchronization request packet at next operation timing. Although the amount of processing of the relay equipment is increased, therefore, the multiplexing efficiency is improved. As a result, it becomes possible to cope with a large scale system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A packet communication system according to the next invention is wherein said terminal equipments and relay equipments share a synchronization timing number that increases by 1 every operation timing according to timing synchronization control, and each of said relay equipments transmits packets having a number and a length predetermined for each terminal equipment toward an opposite terminal equipment in the wake of the synchronization request at operation timing specified by a synchronization timing number predetermined for each terminal equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, terminal equipments and relay equipments share a synchronization timing number that increases by 1 every operation timing according to timing synchronization control, and each of the relay equipments transmits packets having a number and a length predetermined for each terminal equipment toward an opposite terminal equipment in the wake of the synchronization request at operation timing specified by a synchronization timing number predetermined for each terminal equipment. Information packets are thus transmitted dispersedly. As compared with the case where the information packets are transmitted simultaneously, therefore, the multiplexing efficiency can be improved. As a result, it is possible to cope with a large scale system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A packet communication system according to the next invention is wherein each of said terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits an equipment management packet for notification and collection of failure information and update of initial setting parameters and operation programs of respective equipments, toward an adjacent equipment in the wake of the synchronization request packet according to a length and a number predetermined for each of said terminal equipments and relay equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits an equipment management packet for notification and collection of failure information and update of initial setting parameters and operation programs of respective equipments, toward an adjacent equipment in the wake of the synchronization request packet according to a length and a number predetermined for each of the terminal equipments and relay equipment. Therefore, each equipment can transmit and receive the equipment management packet together with the synchronization control packet and the information packets. As a result, it is possible to constitute a system having a higher reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A packet communication system according to the next invention is wherein each of said terminal equipments has packets of best effort type that are retransmitted by a communication procedure of a higher order layer even if said packets have been discarded because of system congestion, as nonpreferential information packets; when there is a time for transmitting information packets of a maximum length in an interval between transmission of an information packet and next operation timing, each of said terminal equipments transmits said nonpreferential information packets; and when there is a time required for transmission of information packets of a maximum length in an interval between relay and next operation timing, each of said relay equipments relays said nonpreferential information packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the terminal equipments has packets of best effort type that are retransmitted by a communication procedure of a higher order layer even if the packets have been discarded because of system congestion, as nonpreferential information packets. When there is a time for transmitting information packets of a maximum length in an interval between transmission of an information packet and next operation timing, each of the terminal equipments transmits the nonpreferential information packets toward opposite terminal equipment. When there is a time required for transmission of information packets of a maximum length in an interval between relay and next operation timing, each of the relay equipments relays the nonpreferential information packets. Therefore, each equipment can transmit and receive nonpreferential information packets together with the synchronization control packet and the information packets. By using the nonpreferential information packets, packet communication having a higher degree of freedom can be conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A packet communication system according to the next invention is wherein each of said relay equipments further comprises a detection unit which detects an error of a timing synchronization procedure or an excess of the number of information packets between said relay equipment and an adjacent equipment; and a relay stoping unit which is responsive to detection of an error of a timing synchronization procedure or an excess of the number of information packets conducted by said detection unit, for stopping the relay of information packets until said error of a timing synchronization procedure or excess of the number of information packets is canceled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the relay equipments detects an error of a timing synchronization procedure or an excess of the number of information packets between the relay equipment and an adjacent equipment. When an error of a timing synchronization procedure or an excess of the number of information packets has been detected, the relay equipment stops the relay of information packets until the error of a timing synchronization procedure or excess of the number of information packets is canceled. Therefore, information packets received from a fault equipment and disturbed in transmission period are not relayed, and consequently information packets received from other equipments can be relayed without obstructing them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A packet communication method according to the next invention is a packet communication method that is applicable to a packet communication system, said packet communication system including a plurality of terminal equipments that conduct communication operation at periodic timing; and relay equipments that relay packets given and received between said terminal equipments, wherein synchronization control packets for timing synchronization are transmitted between adjacent equipments to thereby establish synchronization of operation timing. The packet communication method comprises: a synchronization request step at which each of said terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits a synchronization request packet to an adjacent equipment at own operation timing and thereby conducting a synchronization request; a synchronization response step at which, in response to acceptance of a synchronization request packet from said adjacent equipment, each of said terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits a synchronization response packet corresponding to the synchronization request packet according to own synchronization timing and thereby conducts a synchronization response; a calculation step at which each of said terminal equipments and relay equipments calculates a synchronization deviation value with respect to an adjacent equipment on the basis of a time difference between an arrival time of the synchronization response packet transmitted from said adjacent equipment and own operation timing; and a correction step at which each of said terminal equipments and relay equipments corrects operation timing of the own equipment on the basis of the synchronization deviation value calculated at the calculation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits a synchronization request packet to an adjacent equipment at its own operation timing and thereby conducts a synchronization request. When a synchronization request packet is accepted from the adjacent equipment, each of the terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits a synchronization response packet corresponding to the synchronization request packet according to its own synchronization timing and thereby conducts a synchronization response, calculates a synchronization deviation value with respect to an adjacent equipment on the basis of a time difference between an arrival time of the synchronization response packet transmitted from the adjacent equipment and own operation timing, and corrects the operation timing of the own equipment on the basis of the calculated synchronization deviation value. As a result, timing synchronization can be executed among a plurality of terminal equipments. The capacity of the packet reception buffer can be reduced. The maximum value of the transmission delay time of the information packets can be definitely assured. </paragraph>

As a result, packet communication can be conducted efficiently. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the relay equipments extracts only data portions of information packets received between current operation timing and next operation timing, when relaying information packets from an N side route of a 1:N multiplexing and broadcasting communication system to a 1 side route, generates packets having data portions extracted at the extraction step and arranged in a predetermined order, and relays the packets in the wake of the synchronization request packet at next operation timing. Although the amount of processing of the relay equipment is increased, therefore, the multiplexing efficiency is improved. As a result, it becomes possible to cope with a large scale system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A packet communication method according to the next invention wherein said terminal equipments and relay equipments share a synchronization timing number that increases by 1 every operation timing according to timing synchronization control, and each of said relay equipments transmits packets having a number and a length predetermined for each terminal equipment toward an opposite terminal equipment in the wake of the synchronization request at operation timing specified by a synchronization timing number predetermined for each terminal equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, terminal equipments and relay equipments share a synchronization timing number that increases by 1 every operation timing according to timing synchronization control, and each of the relay equipments transmits packets having a number and a length predetermined for each terminal equipment toward an opposite terminal equipment in the wake of the synchronization request at operation timing specified by a synchronization timing number predetermined for each terminal equipment. Information packets are thus transmitted dispersedly. As compared with the case where the information packets are transmitted simultaneously, therefore, the multiplexing efficiency can be improved.

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the terminal equipments and relay equipments transmits an equipment management packet for notification and collection of failure information and update of initial setting parameters and operation programs of respective equipments, toward an adjacent equipment in the wake of the synchronization request packet according to a length and a number predetermined for each of the terminal equipments and relay equipment. Therefore, each equipment can transmit and receive the equipment management packet together with the synchronization control packet and the information packets. As a result, it is possible to constitute a system having a higher reliability. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the terminal equipments has packets of best effort type that are retransmitted by a communication procedure of a higher order layer even if the packets have been discarded because of system congestion, as nonpreferential information packets. When there is a time for transmitting information packets of a maximum length in an interval between transmission of an information packet and next operation timing, each of the terminal equipments transmits the nonpreferential information packets toward opposite terminal equipment. When there is a time required for transmission of information packets of a maximum length in an interval between relay and next operation timing, each of the relay equipments relays the nonpreferential information packets. Therefore, each equipment can transmit and receive nonpreferential information packets together with the synchronization control packet and the information packets. By using the nonpreferential information packets, packet communication having a higher degree of freedom can be conducted. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, each of the relay equipments detects an error of a timing synchronization procedure or an excess of the number of information packets between the relay equipment and an adjacent equipment. When an error of a timing synchronization procedure or an excess of the number of information packets has been detected, the relay equipment stops the relay of information packets until the error of a timing synchronization procedure or excess of the number of information packets is canceled. Therefore, information packets received from a fault equipment and disturbed in transmission period are not relayed, and consequently information packets received from other equipments can be relayed without obstructing them. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> This packet communication system includes a plurality of transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(hereafter referred generically to as &ldquo;transmission side terminal equipments 11&rdquo;) and a plurality of reception side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(hereafter referred generically to as &ldquo;reception side terminal equipments 12&rdquo;), which execute communication operation in synchronism with a periodic timing signal, and at least one multiplexing equipments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(hereafter referred generically to as &ldquo;multiplexing equipments 13&rdquo;), which relay packets transmitted and received between the transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and reception side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> By the way, in such a packet communication system, timing of all equipments included in the system is synchronized by making a synchronization control packet for timing synchronization go back and forth between a terminal equipment and a relay equipment that are adjacent to each other or between relay equipments. By the way, analog signals are input to the transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>conducts multiplexing processing of superposing signals of multiple channels supplied from the transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>combining them into one channel, and generating information packets. The multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>conducts multiplexing processing of superposing signals of multiple channels supplied from the transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>and combining them into one channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>receives information packets from the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>and relays them to the reception side multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>transmits the information packets relayed from the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the reception side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the packet communication system of the present embodiment, respective equipments are defined with respect to the synchronization control as follows, in order to conduct timing synchronization among all terminal equipments. Furthermore, also in the case where a loop path is formed in the system, similar defining is conducted by virtually cutting the loop path apart and regarding the loop path as a radial path centering around a master. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In other words, one of all equipments is determined to be a master. &ldquo;Master&rdquo; means a synchronization timing source of a period T in all equipments. By the way, in the present embodiment, the packet communication system is designed so that the sum of the total transmission time of information packets transmitted by all transmission terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> during a period T and transmission time of one packet of the synchronization control packet will not exceed the period T. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, multiplexing equipments other than the master are determined to be submasters. Each of the submasters is slave-synchronized with an adjacent master or submaster. Between submasters, a submaster located far away from the master is slave-synchronized with a submaster located near the master. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> For example, if the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(relay equipment) has been determined to be a master, then the multiplexing equipments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(relay equipments) other than the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(master) become submasters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In addition, the transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the reception side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> other than the master are made to be slaves. Each of the transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the reception side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (slaves) slave-synchronizes with an adjacent master or submaster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For example, if the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(relay equipment) has been determined to be a master, then the transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and the reception side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>become slaves. The transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(slaves) are slave-synchronized with the adjacent multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>(submaster). The transmission side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(slaves) are slave-synchronized with the adjacent multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(submaster). The reception side terminal equipments <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(slaves) are slave-synchronized with the adjacent multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(submaster). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the packet communication system of the present embodiment, timing synchronization is achieved by making a synchronization control packet go back and forth between adjacent equipments on the basis of the definition heretofore described. As combinations of adjacent equipments, there can be considered four ways: the master and a submaster, a submaster and a slave, the master and a slave, and a submaster near the master and a submaster far away from the master. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram showing a timing synchronization procedure between the master and a submaster that are adjacent to each other. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> denotes a synchronization control packet at the time of request, and numeral <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> denotes a synchronization control packet at the time of response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, timing synchronization between the master and a submaster that are adjacent to each other will be described hereafter. Since timing synchronization is conducted in the same way for other combinations other than the master and a submaster as well, description thereof will be omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the packet communication system of the present embodiment, first the submaster transmits a synchronization control packet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (request) to the master at a period longer than the period T in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal of the submaster itself (first timing synchronization procedure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, upon receiving the synchronization control packet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (request) in the first timing synchronization procedure, the master measures a time difference Tm in arrival time between an immediately preceding synchronization timing signal of itself and the pertinent synchronization timing signal (second timing synchronization procedure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the master stores a time difference Tm in the second timing synchronization procedure and a synchronization timing number (illustrated M&plus;1) at the time when the packet has been transmitted, in the synchronization control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (response), and transmits the synchronization control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (response) to the submaster in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal of itself (third timing synchronization procedure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, upon receiving the synchronization control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (response) in the third timing synchronization procedure, the submaster measures a time difference Ts in arrival time between an immediately preceding synchronization timing signal of itself and the pertinent synchronization timing signal (fourth timing synchronization procedure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Denoting a transmission delay time of an outward trip transmission path by Td<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a transmission delay time of a return trip transmission path by Td<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a deviation in synchronization timing between the master and the submaster by &Dgr;T, relations Tm&equals;&Dgr;T&plus;Td<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Td<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;&Dgr;T&plus;Ts are satisfied as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> And the transmission delay time Td<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the outward trip transmission path is equal to the transmission delay time Td<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the return trip transmission path. In other words, the outward trip and return trip transmission delay times of the transmission path are equal (Td<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;Td<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) Therefore, the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>&Dgr;T&equals;</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Tm&minus;Ts</italic></highlight>)/2&emsp;&emsp;(1)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> is satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the submaster calculates &Dgr;T by using the equation (1), and makes the synchronization timing of itself coincide with the synchronization timing signal of the master (fifth timing synchronization procedure). On the basis of the synchronization timing number (illustrated M&plus;1) stored in the synchronization control packet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (response) in the third timing synchronization procedure, the submaster makes the synchronization timing number of itself coincide with a synchronization timing number (illustrated M) of the master (sixth timing synchronization procedure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the packet communication system of the present embodiment, timing synchronization is achieved between adjacent equipments one after another by executing the first timing synchronization procedure to the sixth timing synchronization procedure described heretofore. Timing synchronization of all equipments ranging from the master to the terminal slaves are thus achieved by taking the master as a synchronization timing source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> By the way, the equation (1) is satisfied only when the outward trip and return trip transmission delay times of the transmission path are equal. Therefore, each equipment needs to transmit a synchronization control packet with a fixed delay from synchronization timing of itself without fluctuation. Internal configurations of the packet communication system of the present embodiment and its operation required therefor will be described hereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Internal configurations of the transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and the reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a transmission side terminal equipment, numeral <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> denotes a reception side terminal equipment, numeral <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> denotes a multiplexing equipment, numeral <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> denotes an A/D conversion circuit, numeral <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> denotes a packet assembly circuit, numeral <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> denotes a packet processing circuit, numeral <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> denotes a packet multiplexing and broadcasting circuit, and numerals <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, . . . , </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>denote synchronization control circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the packet communication system of the present embodiment, other synchronization control circuits in the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are first synchronized with a synchronization timing signal of one of the synchronization control circuits <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, . . . , </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>For example, if the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is the master and the synchronization control circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is the synchronization timing source, then the synchronization control circuits <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, . . . , </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are synchronized with the synchronization control circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>Furthermore, if the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a submaster and a master is connected beyond the synchronization control circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>then the synchronization control circuits <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, . . . , </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are synchronized with the synchronization control circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in the transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, information packets are transmitted as heretofore described. First, the synchronization control circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits a synchronization control packet to an adjacent equipment in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal in accordance with the above-mentioned timing synchronization procedure, and conducts timing synchronization (first transmission step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the A/D conversion circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> conducts A/D conversion on an input analog signal in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal (second transmission step). Thereafter, the packet assembly circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> stores analog signal information (digital signal) after the A/D conversion in data areas of information packets (third transmission step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in the case where a synchronization control packet is transmitted toward an adjacent equipment in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal, the packet assembly circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> transmits the information packets generated at the third transmission step toward the opposite reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the wake of the synchronization control packet in the period T, according to a packet length and the number of packets determined previously for each transmission side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, in the case where a synchronization control packet is not transmitted, the packet assembly circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> transmits the information packets toward the opposite reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal (fourth transmission step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, information packets received from an N side route of a 1:N multiplexing and broadcasting communication system are relayed to a 1 side route of the 1:N multiplexing and broadcasting communication system as described hereafter. That is, each of the synchronization control circuits <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, . . . , </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>transmits a synchronization control packet to an adjacent equipment in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal in accordance with the above-mentioned timing synchronization procedure, and thereby conducts timing synchronization (first relay step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the packet multiplexing and broadcasting circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> temporarily holds a plurality of information packets received in a period T, by using the synchronization timing of its own equipment as a reference (second relay step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in the case where a synchronization control packet is transmitted toward an adjacent equipment in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal, the packet multiplexing and broadcasting circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> transmits a plurality of information packets generated at the second relay step one after another in the wake of the synchronization control packet. In the case where a synchronization control packet is not transmitted, the packet multiplexing and broadcasting circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> transmits a plurality of information packets generated at the second relay step one after another in synchronism with a synchronization timing signal (third relay step). Furthermore, the multiplexing equipment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> conducts broadcast relay of information packets as well received from an 1 side route of a 1:N multiplexing and broadcasting communication system to an N side route of the 1:N multiplexing and broadcasting communication system in the same way as the foregoing description (fourth relay step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the reception side terminal equipment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> processes information packets as heretofore described.
