<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is known that the NAND-type memory array is based on the above construction and this basic construction is constantly arranged. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> First, the read operation includes applying a voltage of 0&tilde;1V to the bit line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0V to the triple P well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 3V to the source node <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 5V to the drain select line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 5V to the source select line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 3V to the cell gate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and applying a voltage of 3V to the triple N well <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The program operation includes applying a voltage of &minus;9V to the bit line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of &minus;9V to the triple P well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0V to the source node <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0V to the drain select line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of &minus;9V to the source select line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 9V to the cell gate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and applying a voltage of 0V to the triple N well <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The erase operation includes applying a voltage of 9V to the bit line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 9V to the triple P well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, making the source node <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> floated, making the drain select lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> floated, making the source select lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> floated, applying a voltage of &minus;9V the cell gate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and applying a voltage of 9V to the triple N well <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the above conventional NAND-type memory array, as the triple P well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is independently driven by the dip trench device isolation film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in structure, it is required that all the well bias be applied via the bit line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> upon reading, programming and erasure operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is inevitable that the bias is applied to the well in programming and erasure operations using this method. In a reading operation, however, there is a problem that the read speed is lowered due to a well loading if this method is used. In other words, if a voltage of 3V is applied to the source node <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a voltage of 3V is applied to the cell gate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> upon a reading operation, a bias passing the cell is applied to the bit line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which charges the well via the P&plus; junction <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As such, as the loading of the triple P well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is generated upon a reading operation, delay in the speed is caused. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the above, the P well node <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is for applying a bias of the well upon erasing and reading operation, the triple P well select gate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is for selecting the P well node <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the program well select gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is for applying a bias to the well via the bit line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> upon a programming operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A NAND-type memory array is based on the above construction and this basic construction is constantly arranged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> An operation of reading, programming and erasing the conventional NAND-type memory array will be described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> showing a node bias condition of the NAND-type memory array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> First, the read operation includes applying a voltage of 0&tilde;1V to the bit line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0&tilde;1V to the triple P well <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 3V to the source node <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 5V to the drain select line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 5V to the source select line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0V to the program well select gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and applying a voltage of 3V to the triple P well select gate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the above, upon a reading operation, if a voltage of 3V is applied to the source node of the cell, a voltage of 5V is applied to the source select line, a voltage of 5V is applied to the pass gate, a voltage of 3V is applied to the cell gate and a voltage of 5V is applied to the drain select line, the voltage in the source passes through a cell string and is transmitted to the bit line, so that the voltage can be read. At this time, as the program well select gate has a voltage of 0V, a bias of the bit line is not transmitted to the well but a bias of the P well node is applied to the P well due to 3V of the triple P well select gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The program operation includes applying a voltage of &minus;9V to the bit line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0V to the P well node <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0V to the source node <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0V to the drain select line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 0V to the source select line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 3V to the program well select gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and applying a voltage of &minus;9V to the triple P well select gate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the above, bit programming can be performed upon a programming operation. The bit line to be programmed are applied with a negative voltage and the bit line not to be programmed are applied with a voltage of 0V. In case of programming the bit line, as the negative bias of the bit line is applied to the connected N&plus; junction, and the triple P well and the N&plus; junction are diode turn-on, the bias of the triple P well becomes negative. As the program well select gate is 3V, the bias of the triple P well become same to that of the bit line via the P&plus; junction. At this time, if a positive bias is applied to the cell gate, the cell gate is programmed by means of a channel Fowle-Nordhein tunneling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The erase operation includes applying a voltage of 9V to the bit line <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, applying a voltage of 9V to the P well node <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, making the source node <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> floated, making the drain select line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> floated, making the source select line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> floated, applying a voltage of 0V to the program well select gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and applying a voltage of 12V to the triple P well select gate <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the above, upon an erasure operation, a positive bias is applied to the entire well and a negative bias is applied to a selected cell gate, so that an erasure operation is performed by channel Fowle-Nordhein tunneling. If a positive bias is applied to the P well and a bias higher than the P well node is applied to the triple P well select gate, a positive bias is applied to the entire P well separated via the P&plus; junction. If a negative bias is applied to the cell gate, the cell is erased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the present invention separates well and bit line by additionally using a well node for applying a bias to a well upon an erasure and reading operation, a triple well select gate for selecting the well node, and a program well select gate for applying a bias to the well via the bit line upon a programming operation. Therefore, the present invention has an advantage that it can prevent lower in the speed upon a reading operation and thus implement a device having a rapid reading speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
