<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the use of pharmaceutical agents to modulate cell-adhesion. In particular, the invention relates to the use of bisphosphonate compounds for inhibiting cell-adhesion and enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic and/or radiation treatments in the treatment of cancer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cell adhesion is a complex process that is important for maintaining tissue integrity and generating physical and permeability barriers within the body. Cell adhesion is mediated by specific cell surface adhesion molecules (CAMs). There are many different families of CAMs, including the immunoglobulin, integrin, selectin and cadherin superfamilies, and each cell type expresses a unique combination of these molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although cell adhesion is required for certain normal physiological functions including wound repair, there are situations in which cell adhesion is undesirable. For example, many pathologies, such as metastasis, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory diseases, involve abnormal cellular adhesion. Cell adhesion may also play a role in graft rejection. In such pathologies, modulation of cell adhesion may be desirable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Multiple Myeloma and Treatment Resistance </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy of the plasma cell characterized by migration and localization to the bone marrow where cells then disseminate and facilitate the formation of bone lesions. Despite initial responses to chemotherapy, myeloma patients ultimately develop drug resistance and become unresponsive to a wide spectrum of anticancer agents, a phenomenon known as multidrug resistance (MDR). The development of resistance to front-line chemotherapeutic drugs, such as melphalan (an alkylating agent) and doxorubicin (an anthracycline), is a major factor responsible for treatment failure; thus, the median survival of 3.5 years has remained largely unchanged for the past three decades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are many potential mechanisms for drug resistance in myeloma including reduction in intracellular drug accumulation due to overexpression of MDR1/Pglycoprotein, alterations in drug targets such as topoisomerase II, enhanced DNA repair, and overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as bcl-2. These mechanisms are chiefly due to alterations in the malignant cell itself and can be studied using in vitro human myeloma cell. However, these mechanisms alone cannot account for all drug resistance, nor are they likely to explain cell survival following initial cytotoxic drug exposure. Additional mechanisms conferring low level drug resistance are believed to play important roles in the survival and expansion of the malignant cell population. Recent studies have demonstrated that certain resistance mechanisms are observed only in vivo, suggesting that interactions between malignant cells and the surrounding microenvironment may be important in determining response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Factors that allow for tumor cell survival following initial drug exposure need to be identified because these factors may eventually allow for expression of genes associated with acquired drug resistance. In addition, through understanding the mechanism that suppresses drug-induced apoptosis as well as other mediators of drug resistance, improved therapies can be developed which interfere with, or inhibit the resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is known that intercellular interactions can contribute to tumor cell survival during exposure to cytotoxic stresses such as radiation. It is also known that certain resistance mechanisms may only be functional in vivo, where tumor cells continue to interact with environmental factors such as extracellular matrix (ECM) and cellular counter-receptors. For example, Teicher et al. showed that mammary tumors made resistant to alkylating agents in vivo are sensitized to cytotoxic drugs once removed from the animal, Tumor resistance to alkylating agents conferred by mechanisms operative only in vivo, Science 247:1457,1990. Adhesive interactions between same cell types are known to confer resistance to alkylating agents via alterations in cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors such as p27<highlight><superscript>kipl</superscript></highlight>, although the cell surface molecules mediating this type of kinetic resistance have yet to be identified. In addition, adhesion to ECM has been reported to induce P-glycoprotein expression and confer doxorubicin resistance in rat hepatocytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The integrin family of cellular adhesion molecules is a major class of receptors through which cells interact with extracellular matrix components (ECM). Recent evidence has implicated the integrins as being closely involved in the pathology of many diseases. Integrins have been shown to participate in intracellular signal transduction pathways that may contribute to tumor cell growth and survival. Experimental evidence has implicated the PI integrins and fibronectin as playing a part in apoptotic suppression and cell survival. For example, Zhang et al. has demonstrated that fibronectin adhesion through &agr;<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>,(VLA-5) prevents cells from undergoing serum-starvation induced apoptosis by upregulating Bcl-2. The alpha 5 beta I integrin supports survival of cells on fibronectin and up-regulates Bcl-2 expression, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92(13):6161, 1995. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Similar observations are made by Scott et al. and Rozzo et al., who found that anti-&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides, respectively, enhanced chromatin condensation and nucleosomal DNA laddering, characteristics of cells committed to apoptosis. Fibronectin suppresses apoptosis in normal human melanocytes through an integrin-dependent mechanism, J Invest Dennatol 108: 147, 1997. Induction of apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells by abrogation of integrin mediated cell adhesion, Int J Cancer 70:688, 1997. PI integrin activation through interactions with ECM components such as fibronectin directly decreases DNA strand breaks in tumor derived endothelial cells exposed to a number of DNA damaging agents, including etoposide and ionizing radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The &agr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(Very Late Activation Antigen 4, or VLA-4), &agr;<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(VLA-5), and &agr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>heterodimers are the major fibronectin receptors of the integrin family. Although VLA-5 and &agr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>expression are variable in most B cells during malignancy, VLA-4 is strongly expressed in myeloma cells collected from bone marrow. VLA-4 is unique among the integrins as it is the only heterodimer to have been shown to mediate cell-ECM as well as cell-cell interactions. VLA-4 binds to the CS-1 region of fibronectin as well as to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) via separate binding sites. Adhesion to fibronectin via VLA-4 has been shown to prolong eosinophil survival and to downregulate FAS antigen expression, leading to a decrease in cell death. In early hematopoietic and germinal center B cells, adhesion to fibronectin or VCAM-1 via VLA-4 suppresses the apoptotic pathway and contributes to positive selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As myeloma cells adhere in the bone marrow, they stimulate their own growth and cause osteoclast formation through the increased synthesis and secretion of cytokines such as IL-1&bgr;, TNF-&bgr;, M-CSF, and IL-6. IL-6, a potent growth factor for myeloma cells, is secreted from both tumor and stromal cells in response to co-adhesion and VLA-4 ligation. VLA-4 associates with or causes the phosphorylation of a number of signal transduction molecules, including CD19 receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases and focal adhesion kinase (pp125<highlight><superscript>FAK</superscript></highlight>, or FAK), which is an upstream activator of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), among other proteins. FAK plays a major role in suppressing apoptosis both in adherent and suspension cells, and its cleavage by caspases early in the apoptotic process further emphasizes its importance within the cell. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Bisphosphonate </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The bisphosphonates are a class of drugs that have been developed for use in various diseases of bone and calcium metabolism. These drugs all have a characteristic chemical grouping in common, consisting of twin phosphorus atoms symmetrically linked to a single carbon atom (P&mdash;C&mdash;P). Bisphosphonates have physicochemical and biological effects on osteoclasts that inhibit osteoclast activity and bone loss. Bisphosphonates are adsorbed to the surface of hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone. Lower bone resorption seen with these agents may be due to a direct action on osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells), an indirect effect on osteoclast recruitment, or both. At sufficient doses, bisphosphonates retard the mineralization of bone, by inhibiting formation of new crystals, blocking the transformation of amorphous calcium phosphate to hydroxyapatite, and delaying the aggregation of apatite crystals into larger crystals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, these agents do not inhibit the bone matrix synthesizing ability of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). Bisphosphonate bound to the bone surface becomes covered with new bone during the formation part of the remodeling cycle. It appears that drugs bound within the bone matrix are not active, and remain in the bone for years. Because intraskeletal bisphosphonates no longer have activity against osteoclasts, they must be administered continually in order to reap the benefits of their pharmacological activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> This group of drugs is used in the management of bone disease with increased osteoclastic bone destruction, and also for treatment of the high turnover form of osteoporosis characterized by increased osteoclastic activity. Rheumatoid arthritis has been also suggested as a target for this class of drugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Bisphosphonates in general are known as bone resorption inhibitors (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,972,913; 5,891,863; and 5,646,134). Other patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,561 disclose various bisphosphonates in a method of treating calcium metabolism disturbances like osteoporosis, Paget&apos;s disease or Bechterew&apos;s disease. Specifically, alendronate, 4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid monosodium trihydrate is a known bone resorption inhibitor and is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,922,007 and 5,019,651. Clodronate, (dichloromethylene)bisphosphonic acid disodium salt or dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP), is described in Belgian Patent 672,205 (1966). Tiludronate, (&lsqb;(4-chlorophenyl)thiomethylene&rsqb;-bisphosphonic acid) is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,876,248. BM 21.0995 (1-Hydroxy-3-(methylpentylamino)-propylidene-bisphosphonate), is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,814. YM 175 (&lsqb;(cycloheptylamino)methylene&rsqb;bisphosphonic acid, disodium salt) is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,970,335. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When used in combination with estrogen, the bisphosphonate compound risedronate, (sodium trihydrogen &lsqb;1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethylidene&rsqb;bisphosphonate) has shown a positive effect on bone loss in ovariectomized rats. Similarly, when used in conjunction with estrogen, piridronate, (&lsqb;2-(2-pyridinyl)ethylidene&rsqb;-bisphosphonic acid, monosodium salt) has shown bone resorption inhibition activity, (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,406). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Bisphosphonates have been used with limited success to correct hypercalcemia in malignancy. For example, clinical studies in patients with breast cancer metastatic to the skeleton, have indicated that prolonged co-administration of oral bisphosphonates, such as clodronate or pamidronate, in addition to systemic antineoplastic therapy, can reduce the frequency of morbid skeletal events, including the incidence of hypercalcemic episodes and the need for radiotherapy, (see abstract of Body JJ, Clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer to bone: past&mdash;present&mdash;future, Can J Oncol Dec. 5, 1995; Suppl 1:16-27). A possible use of pamidronate or 3-Amino-1-hydroxypropane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (APF) in prophylactic treatment of cancer patients to prevent bone metastases has also been described (see abstract of Wingen F, Schmahl D, Pharmacokinetics of the osteotropic diphosphonate 3-amino-1-acid in mammals, Arzneimittelforschung September 1987;37(9):1037-42). Articles by van der Pluijm et al., and Boissier et al., describe the bisphosphonate-mediated inhibition of adhesion of breast and prostate cancer cells to bone matrices in vitro (see abstract by van der Pluijm et al., Bisphosphonates inhibit the adhesion of breast cancer cells to bone matrices in vitro, Clin Invest Aug. 1, 1996;98(3):698-705; Boissier et al., Bisphosphonates inhibit prostate and breast carcinoma cell adhesion to unmineralized and mineralized bone extracellular matrices, Cancer Res Sep. 15, 1997;57(18):3890-4). Antitumor activities of taxoids when administered in combination with the bisphosphonate ibandronate are enhanced in an additive fashion especially against invasion and adhesion of human breast carcinoma cells to bone (see abstract by Magnetto S, et al., Additive antitumor activities of taxoids in combination with the bisphosphonate ibandronate against invasion and adhesion of human breast carcinoma cells to bone, Int J Cancer Oct. 8, 1999;83(2):263-9). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, none of the above cited art references discloses or even suggests the administration of bisphosphonates prior to chemo- or radiotherapy, nor in situations when such drugs may help to overcome cell adhesion inhibition-mediated drug resistance. In contrast, and teaching away from the instant invention, the rise of drug resistant tumor cells is usually associated with reduced migratory and invasive ability and a lower adhesion capacity (see abstract by Scotlandi K. et al., Multidrug resistance and malignancy in human osteosarcoma, Cancer Res May 15, 1996;56(10):(2434-9). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need in the art for compounds that modulate cell adhesion to improve, for example, the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy of cancer cells such as multiple myeloma without the aforementioned disadvantages. The present invention fulfills this need and further provides other related advantages that will become apparent to one of ordinary skill of the art upon reading the following disclosure. </paragraph>

Selection for drug resistance to melphalan and doxorubicin in mycloma cell lines results in upregulation of expression of VLA4 and increased adhesion to FN. Human myeloma cell lines 8226 and U266 adhere to fibronectin (FN) through &bgr;1 integrin interactions (VLA-4 and VLA-5). Melphalan and doxorubicin resistant variants of these cell lines show increased levels of VLA-4 mediated adhesion to FN as determined by anti-integrin mAbs. </paragraph>

Cells are allowed to adhere for one hour to fibronectin in serum free media, unadhered cells are then washed and 200 &mgr;l RPNH media containing 5 percent FBS is added back to each well. Growth is measured by MIT at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> illustrates thymidine incorporation. 96 well plates are coated with 50 &mgr;g/ml fibronectin (FN), 0.01 percent BSA or two percent Poly-Hema (prevents adhesion to plastic) per well. Cells are allowed to adhere for one hour to fibronectin in serum free media and, unadhered cells are removed and 200 &mgr;l RPMI media containing 5 percent FBS is added back to each well. Cells are pulsed with two &mgr;Ci 3H-thymidine for three hours at each respective time point. A cell harvester is used to collect DNA, and labeled DNA is counted on a scintillation counter. </paragraph>

Cells are allowed to adhere to fibronectin or poly-lysine coated plates for 48 or 76 hours. Unattached cells are removed by washing the plate with PBS before removing adhered cells. Cells which adhere to fibronectin are removed with PBS containing two mM EDTA. Cells are fixed, RNA is digested with RNase and the nuclei are stained with propidium iodide. Cell cycle is analyzed by FACS and a Cell Lysis software program is used to determine the percentage of cells in G1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Overexpression of CDK inhibitors correlates with a decrease in sensitivity to chemotheurapeutic agents. Cells that have been arrested in G1 have an increased capacity to repair DNA damage induced by DNA damaging agents such as cis-platinum and doxorubicin. Thus, physiological mediators of G1 arrest are important targets for sensitizing cells to existing chemotheurapeutic agents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;bisphosphonate&rdquo; denotes a compound having a characteristic chemical grouping of twin phosphorus atoms symmetrically linked to a single carbon atom (P&mdash;C&mdash;P), and wherein the carbon and phosphorus atoms may be further substitituted. Bisphosphonates are synthetic organic compounds structurally related to pyrophosphate in that the pyrophosphate P&mdash;O&mdash;P-bond is replaced by a P&mdash;C&mdash;P-bond. In contrast to pyrophosphate, bisphosphonates are resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis in osseous tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Within certain aspects of the present invention, one or more bisphosphonates as described herein may be present within a pharmaceutical composition. A pharmaceutical composition comprises one or more bisphosphonates, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients. Such compositions may comprise buffers (e.g., neutral buffered saline or phosphate buffered saline), carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, mannose, sucrose or dextrans), mannitol, proteins, polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine, antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA or glutathione, adjuvants (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) and/or preservatives. Within yet other embodiments, compositions of the present invention may be formulated as a lyophilizate. A bisphosphonate may, but need not, be encapsulated within liposomes using well known technology. Compositions of the present invention may be formulated for any appropriate manner of administration, including for example, topical, oral, nasal, intravenous, intracranial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular administration. For certain topical applications, formulation as a cream or lotion, using well known components, is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Integrin-mediated adhesion influences cell survival and can prevent programmed cell death. Drug-sensitive 8226 human myeloma cells express both VLA-4 (&agr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) and VLA-5 (&agr;<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) integrin fibronectin (FN) receptors, and are relatively resistant to the apoptotic effects of doxorubicin and melphalan when pre-adhered to FN, as compared with cells grown in suspension. This cell adhesion mediated drug resistance, or CAM-DR, is not due to reduced drug accumulation or upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. As determined by flow cytometry, mycloma cell lines selected for drug resistance, with either doxorubicin or melphalan, overexpress VLA-4. Functional assays reveal a significant increase in &agr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-mediated cell adhesion in both drug-resistant variants compared with the drug-sensitive parent line. When removed from selection pressure, drug-resistant cell lines revert to a drug sensitive and &agr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-low phenotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> It is therefore disclosed herein that FN-mediated adhesion confers a survival advantage for myeloma cells acutely exposed to cytotoxic drugs by inhibiting drug-induced apoptosis. This finding explains how some cells survive initial drug exposure and eventually express classical mechanisms of drug resistance such as MDR1 overexpression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;efficacy&rdquo; as applied to therapy, can mean that a lower dose of a therapeutic agent is required to achieve a therapeutic goal, or that shorter or fewer therapeutic treatements are required to achieve a therapeutic goal, or both. </paragraph>

As a control, an approximately equal cell number is added to uncoated wells or wells coated with BSA. After 24 hours, doxorubicin or melphalan is added to each well for one hour, drug-containing media is then removed and replaced by fresh media.

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Because active drug transport is a common mechanism of doxorubicin resistance and because in rare instances ECM adhesion can upregulate P-glycoprotein, possible reductions in intracellular drug accumulation in adhered myeloma cells are examined. A flow cytometry-based intracellular drug accumulation assay reveales that the concentration of doxorubicin, which emits at 573 nm after excitation, in FN-adhered myeloma cells is equal to that seen in non-adhered controls &lsqb;<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>&rsqb;. Due to the fact that some drug transporters may alter nuclear drug concentration with minimal effects on total intracellular drug, RT-PCR is used to investigate whether or not three known transport proteins are upregulated by FN adhesion. Two members of the ABC superfamily of transmembrane gycoproteins, MDR1 (encoding P-glycoprotein) and MRP (encoding the multidrug resistance-associated protein), which are known to actively extrude drugs such as doxorubicin, are unchanged following FN adhesion. Expression of LRP (lung resistance-associated protein), which has also been associated with drug resistance, is also unchanged in adhered myeloma cells compared to suspension cells. In addition to ruling out altered drug transport as a mechanism of adhesion-based drug resistance, these studies also show that ECM components of the bone marrow microenvironment environmental probably do not affect the intrinsic expression of these drug transporters in human myeloma cells. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Discussion </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Integrins and ECM interactions play critical roles in cell survival. During the course of initial or chronic drug exposure, myeloma cells overexpressing VLA-4 have a selection advantage over cells expressing low levels of this protein. Experiments involving the treatment of 8226/S with short term (1-48 hours) doses of doxorubicin or melphalan indicate that increases in &agr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>expression are not seen immediately, probably ruling out drug-induced transcriptional upregulation as a reason for FN receptor overexpression. Drug resistant cells removed from chronic drug exposure eventually lose their high &agr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>expression levels along with their resistant phenotype, implicating selection pressure as a prerequisite for &agr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>upregulation. This correlation between integrin expression and resistance levels is seen in both doxorubicin- and melphalan-selected variants of 8226/S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Cells in direct contact with immobilized FN are less sensitive to acute doxorubicin treatment. A decreased response to melphalan in FN-adhered cells is not consistently observed during acute exposure using MTT cytotoxicity analysis (possibly as a result of assay insensitivity), however, significant increases in cell survival are detected using Annexin V. Although the level of cytoprotection may be small following an acute survival assay, these differences may be sufficient to give rise to a large phenotypically distinct population over the course of chronic drug exposure in vitro or in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Soluble FN may have the capacity to induce &bgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>signaling without adhesion within myeloma cell cultures. The overexpression and utilization of &agr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>for FN adhesion by drug resistant myeloma cell lines may indicate a consequent increase in the number of intercellular interactions (through FN binding, VCAM-1 binding, or homotypic &agr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>binding by tumor cells exposed to DNA damaging agents, or the increased binding of soluble FN from serum). Many cultured myeloma cell lines, including 8226, produce a relatively high amount of cell surface FN compared to normal plasma cells, an observation also seen clinically in patient specimens. DNA damaging agents such as doxorubicin or melphalan may also induce increased production of ligand, as is shown with human mesangial cell cultures and FN synthesis. Cells under selection pressure may then utilize soluble or cell-bound integrin ligands, and subsequent &agr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-mediated signaling, as a cytoprotective mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Some previously established mechanisms of drug resistance are investigated as possible causes of the cytoprotective effect of FN observed. Since drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein have been well documented mediators of drug resistance in myeloma cells, possible alterations in intracellular drug concentration following adhesion are investigated. FN-adhered cells are found to contain doxorubicin levels equal to those seen in non-adhered cells using standard techniques. In some cases, intracellular drug compartmentalization can be altered by P-glycoprotein without high levels of drug extrusion, for this reason the expression of three drug transporters is analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of MDR1, MRP, and LRP are all equal between FN-adhered and non-adhered cells, probably ruling out induction of active drug transport as a possible mechanism of cytoprotection in these experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Another family of proteins known to effect apoptosis and drug response is the Bcl-2 family. VLA-5 and VLA-6 upregulate Bcl-2 and protect against apoptosis in certain cell types following ligation with FN or laminin, respectively. RNase protection and RT-PCR assays shows the RNA levels coding for this protein to be unchanged in FN-adhered cells. Furthermore, expression levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL, which is upregulated in keratinocytes following adhesion, are unchanged following FN adhesion. No changes in the expression of other anti-apoptotic (Bcl-w and Mcl-1) or pro-apoptotic genes (BAX, Bcl-XS, Bad and Bik) are detected by either of these assays. However, it is also possible that integrins affect post-translational modification of these proteins and their potential participation in CAM-DR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> These investigations provide significant insight on the effects of adhesion on cell cycle kinetics and how this imparts drug resistance to tumor cells. VLA-4-mediated adhesion decreases the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and the &agr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>over expressing cell lines 8226/LR5 and 8226/DOX6 have longer doubling times in culture compared to the 8226/S parent cell line (LR5&equals;30 hr, DOX6&equals;39 hr, S&equals;27 hr). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3 kinase)/AKT pathway has a major influence on cellular apoptotic commitment and PI3 kinase activation inhibits apoptosis in haemopoictic cells. Thus, this pathway is a mechanism of apoptotic suppression in FN-adhered cells. FN adhesion and VLA-4 ligation is known to initiate the PI3 kinase signaling cascade in some cases, but VLA-4 or VLA-5 have not yet been directly correlated with this pathway in myeloma cells. Furthermore, a frequent association is observed between these integrins and FAK, a known activator of PI3 kinase. Through activation by PI3-K lipid products or by direct phosphorylation, AKT phosphorylates the Bcl-XL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD), promoting cell survival possibly by dissociating it from Bcl-XL and decreasing the amount of BAX homodimers. The endpoint of the PI3-K/AKT signaling cascade may involve an eventual blockade of ced3/ICE activity and a subsequent inhibition of tumor cell death. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In summary, integrin-mediated FN adhesion is shown to cause a decreased response to chemotherapeutic drugs as well as a correlation between the expression of &agr;<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>integrin heterodimers and drug resistance. The term cell adhesion mediated drug resistance, or CAM-DR, describes this observation. Two well established causes of drug resistance, active drug transport and increased expression of Bcl-2 family members, are shown not to produce these effects. Clinically, elevated FN receptor expression or function in myeloma cells within the bone marrow may be an indicator of a more aggressive tumor cell which has a survival advantage against the cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer drugs. In vivo alterations in fibronectin receptor expression or function may have a magnified effect on myeloma cell survival when they are in direct association with stromal cells and ECM components of the bone marrow. The cytoprotection conferred by fibronectin receptors may be low level, but intrinsic, since most myeloma cells inherently express moderate to high levels of these integrins. Small changes in drug sensitivity in vitro are probably highly relevant clinically since even a 1 percent surviving tumor fraction can have drastic long term consequences. The CAM-DR mediated by FN adhesion may be sufficient to allow the eventual emergence of drug resistance mechanisms such as upregulation of P-glycoprotein, MRP, and alterations in topoisomerase II, which then become the predominant cytoprotective processes. Therefore, specific integrin subunits and the various signal transduction elements they utilize, provide promising therapeutic targets. Established antagonists of VLA-4 and VLA-5 integrin function may serve as chemosensitizers when administered in conjunction with conventional chemotherapeutics, leading to higher levels of drug response and improved clinical outcome. </paragraph>

Student&apos;s T-test is used to analyze differences in drug response using data collected from at least three different experiments. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> depict representative continuous exposure experiments using mitoxantrone and LPAM, respectively. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As a second method for determining cell survival, an Annexin V flow cytometric based assay is employed. Cells are seeded onto dishes coated with FN, poly-L-lysine (PLL), or BSA (or are kept in suspension) for 2 hours in serum-free media, exposed to drug for 90 minutes, washed, and incubated drug-free for an additional 24 hours. In some experiments, cells are exposed to drug for 24 hours (continuous exposure). The percent of apoptotic cells is then determined by staining with Annexin V, which recognizes inverted phosphatidyl serine on the external surface of the cell as an early apoptotic marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> demonstrates that FN adhesion confers significant protection from apoptosis induced by LPAM exposure. In these experiments, BSA is used as a control for non-specific protein interactions and PLL is used as a control for non-specific cell adhesion. Neither of these substrates confers a survival advantage to cells when compared to those treated in suspension. It is interesting to note that the addition of soluble FN to conditioned serum-free culture media does not cause a consistent suppression of drug-induced apoptosis, suggesting the CAM-DR phenotype requires both ligand occupancy of the FN receptor and integrin-specific cell adhesion. Table 3 summarizes drug and radiation responses of K562 cells adhered to FN vs. grown in suspension. Significant cytoprotection is primarily observed for DNA damaging agents (FN-mediated protection against the microtubule inhibitor vincristine is not significant). FN adhesion also afforded a higher degree of protection following acute (90 minutes) exposure to drug when compared to continuous exposure. Vincristine and Ara-C are only used in continuous exposure experiments due to the inherent insensitivity of K562 cells to these compounds.

<heading lvl="1">Generation and Characterization of Stable VLA-4 Transfectants </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Although the K562 cell line expresses only the VLA-5 FN receptor, CML cells from patients also express the VLA-4. Other cell types also show the anti-apoptotic potential of VLA-4. For these reasons, an &agr;4 positive K562 cell line is created for use in subsequent experiments. A vector containing the full coding sequence for the human &agr;4 integrin subunit is created and transfected into the K562 cell line. As a control, another population of K562 cells is also transfected with an empty vector construct (pcDNA3.1). Following a 4 week culture period with Geneticin (G418) to select for stable positive transfectants, cell populations are analyzed by flow cytometry for cell surface integrin expression. A limiting dilution assay is then used to subclone both high &agr;4 expressing and &agr;4 negative cell lines. Three independent positive and negative clones are grown to confluency and pooled to make the K562/VLA-4 and K562/pcDNA3 cell lines, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> shows cell surface expression of both the &bgr;1 and &agr;5 integrin subunits on the surface of both cell lines but the presence of &agr;4 only on the K562/VLA-4 cell line. RT-PCR using &agr;4 specific primers shows that the &agr;4 message is only detectable in the K562/VLA-4 cell line (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The ability of transfected cell lines to adhere to FN through various integrin subunits is determined using a colorimetric cell adhesion assay and function-blocking antibodies to &bgr;1, &agr;4 and &agr;5. Cells are pre-incubated with integrin-specific antibodies or control antibodies (non-specific mouse IgG) and then seeded onto FN coated 96 well plates for 90 minutes. Although a high level of VLA-4 is expressed on the surface of K562/VLA-4, these cells are incapable of adhering to FN through &agr;4, indicating that VLA-4 is in an inactive conformation. Addition of a &bgr;1-stimulating mAb (clone B3B11) is necessary to induce VLA-4-mediated FN adhesion in K562/VLA-4 but not K562/pcDNA3.1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Incubation with &agr;4 blocking antibody does not significantly reduce FN adhesion in either cell line, indicating that this subunit is either not expressed (in the case of K562/pcDNA3.1) or is not required for adhesion in the presence of the overabundance of VLA-5 (K562/VLA-4). Incubation with &agr;5 blocking antibody blocked almost all adhesion of K562/pcDNA3.1 to FN but only slightly reduced the adhesive capacity of K562/VLA-4. These experimentsshow that K562/pcDNA3.1 adheres to FN solely through VLA-5 (as does the K562 parent cell line), while K562/VLA-4 utilizes both VLA-4 and VLA-5 for FN adhesion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Contribution of &agr;4 and &agr;5 to CAM-DR in K562 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> K562/pcDNA3.l and K562/VLA-4 cells are incubated with mAb B3B11 and anti-&agr;4 or anti-&agr;5 blocking Ab prior to adhesion to FN coated 35 mm dishes to determine whether or not &agr;4 can contribute to CAM-DR in addition to &agr;5 in CML cells. Following a two hour adhesion period, plates are washed with serum-free media (suspension control cells also washed), and media containing 100 &mgr;M LPAM or Acid-OH vehicle control is then added to each sample for 90 minutes and cells are then incubated for an additional 24 hours. Apoptosis is analyzed using Annexin V staining and flow cytometry. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, K</cross-reference>562/VLA-4 cells adhering through both &agr;4 and &agr;5 integrins demonstrate a level of cytoprotection (in comparison to drug treated suspension cells) equivalent to K562/pcDNA3.1 cells adhered through &agr;5 alone (30.0&plusmn;1.5 percent vs. 29.9&plusmn;5.3 percent). When incubated with &agr;4 blocking antibody prior to FN adhesion, both cell lines still demonstrated significant protection against melphalan-induced apoptosis (28.4&plusmn;5.0 percent vs. 29.6&plusmn;2.3 percent). However, when incubated with &agr;5 blocking antibody prior to adhesion, the K562/pcDNA3.1 cells became sensitized to drug whereas the K562/VLA-4 cells remained significantly resistant (0&plusmn;11.1 percent vs. 20.6&plusmn;1.9 percent). It can be concluded that VLA-5 and VLA-4 are capable of inducing cytoprotection in K562 cells through similar mechanisms since the effects of both integrins are not additive compared to either one alone. CD34&plus;CML cells are known to express both of these integrins in vivo and it can be inferred that if either are functional, the CAM-DR phenotype may be initiated through their common &bgr;1 integrin chain. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BCR/ABL-Associated Tyrosine Kinase Activity is not Reconstituted by Integrin-Mediated Signaling </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The BCR/ABL protein is responsible for the constitutive phosphorylation of many kinases associated with integrin-mediated signaling. K562 cells adhered to FN have a higher survival rate than suspension grown cells following AG957 treatment. This leads to the hypothesis that VLA-5 is causing cell survival by substituting for BCR/ABL and inducing the activation of proteins such as p125FAK, p130Cas, PI-3 kinase, paxillin, and c-Abl. A temporal analysis of phosphotyrosine containing proteins by western blotting demonstrates that there is no further increase in the activity of kinases already active due to BCR/ABL, with the exception of an unknown 80 kDa protein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Following a 4 hour treatment with 20 &mgr;M AG957, BCR/ABL associated tyrosine phosphorylation is completely abrogated in suspension cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). In AG957 treated cells, FN adhesion does not reconstitute the phosphotyrosine pattern seen in untreated cells, however the 80 kDa band persists, albeit to a lesser extent. These results indicate that the mechanism of CAM-DR in K562 is independent of the BCR/ABL survival pathway, or at least the portion initiated by tyrosine kinase activation. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FN Adhered K562 Cells Maintain the CAM-DR Phenotype During A G957 Exposure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> With the exception of an unknown 80 kDa protein, FN adhered cells do not induce noticeable tyrosine phosphorylation following AG957 treatment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). It is unclear whether or not FN adhered cells would still be resistant to drug-induced apoptosis following AG957 exposure. Cells are adhered to FN or kept in suspension for 3 hours, then exposed to AG957 (10 or 20 &mgr;M) or DMSO vehicle control for 1 hour, and then treated with 100 &mgr;M LPAM or vehicle control for 90 minutes. Apoptosis is analyzed by Annexin V staining 24 hours later. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the CAM-DR phenotype is maintained even when FN adhesion is followed by AG957 treatment. Integrin activation is sufficient to protect K562 cells from the BCR/ABL inhibitor alone (Acid-OH LPAM controls) and in combination with the alkylating agent. These results further support the finding that integrin-induced cytoprotection is mediated through signaling events independent of the tyrosine kinases activated by BCR/ABL. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Discussion </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Myeloma cells adhered to FN are resistant to drug-induced apoptosis. Similarly, small cell lung cancer cells adhered to FN, collagen, and laminin are resistant to cytotoxic agents. Tumor cell-ECM interactions are also critical determinants in the survival of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. K562 cells adhered to FN are significantly resistant to apoptosis induced by a number of DNA damaging agents including LPAM, mitoxantrone, and &ggr;-irradiation. Non-specific, charge-based adhesion to poly-L-lysine coated surfaces did not result in decreased drug response. In addition, soluble FN added to culture medium did not provide a survival advantage to drug treated cells. These results indicate a requirement for both receptor occupancy by FN as well as physical attachment by the cell in order for cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) to occur. It remains to be determined which cytoskeletal elements may be required for a cytoprotective signal to be initiated when cells become adherent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> When compared to drug sensitive myeloma cells, drug resistant cells overexpress the integrin VLA-4 on their cell surface, indicating this integrin heterodimer may be critical for the emergence of a drug resistant cell population. VLA-4 may also have importance with regard to the survival of B and T cells. CAM-DR is mediated by VLA-5 in K562 cells (which are VLA-4 negative). It would thus be useful to determine if VLA-4 could be cytoprotective in these cells and whether a combination of FN receptor subtypes could lead to enhanced cell survival above and beyond that mediated by either receptor alone. Since CML cells isolated from patients are known to express both VLA-4 and VLA-5, this information could prove to be useful for the future application of pharmacological inhibitors against &agr;4, &agr;5, or &bgr;1 integrin subunits in this disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> When adhered to FN, K562/pcDNA3.1 cells (expressing only VLA-5) and K562/VLA-4 cells (expressing both VLA-5 and VLA-4) are found to have comparable responses when treated with LPAM. Blocking antibody experiments also demonstrate that VLA-4 by itself could also be cytoprotective in K562 cells. It can therefore be concluded that each of these integrins share similar signaling capabilities likely based on their common &bgr;1 subunit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The BCR/ABL kinase is believed to be critical to the survival of CML cells through its effects on a number of signal transduction pathways. Inhibitors of this fusion protein show promise as apoptosis-inducing drugs in CML cells. BCR/ABL inhibition by relatively high doses of the tyrphostin AG957 can have negative effects on FN adhesion. At the concentrations of inhibitor used in cytotoxicity assays, the adhesion of K562 cells to FN is not affected by more than 20-40 percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In addition to the cytotoxic agents examined, K562 CML cells are found to be resistant to the BCR/ABL inhibitor AG957 when adhered to FN. These observations show that integrins, in at least the K562 cell line, may signal through tyrosine kinases similar to those activated by BCR/ABL, effectively reconstituting the survival pathway inhibited by AG957. In some instances, when activated through FN adhesion, integrins are known to mimic many of the aspects of BCR/ABL signaling through the recruitment of c-Abl. Proteins such as p125FAK, p130Cas, paxillin, and PI3-kinase are activated (through tyrosine phosphorylation) by both BCR/ABL and &bgr;1 integrins independently. Therefore, FN adhesion allow K562 cells to survive BCR/ABL inhibition by substituting as the initiator of this survival pathway. However, it is discovered that the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern induced by the BCR/ABL kinase is completely abrogated by AG957 in both suspension and FN adhered cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), indicating that integrin ligation is providing a survival signal independent of this group of signaling proteins. A protein band of approximately 80 kDa is activated by FN adhesion and persisted, to a lesser degree, in AG957 treated cells. Note that this protein is affected as well by AG957, indicating a degree of non-specificity of this compound. Although these experiments rule out the integrin-induced activation of focal adhesion proteins such as FAK (125 kDa), p130Cas (125 and 115 kDa), paxillin (65 kDa) and c-Abl (145 kDa), other &bgr;1 integrin-activated proteins that are not detected by phosphotyrosine analysis, such as serine/threonine phosphorylated proteins, may contribute to the CAM-DR phenotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> &ggr;-irradiation and drugs such as melphalan, mitoxantrone, and AG957 induce apoptosis through different means. The ability of &bgr;1 integrins to protect cells from apoptosis induced by such a wide range of functionally distinct agents suggests a block in the initiation or execution of apoptosis at a point of general convergence. The Bcl-2 family of proteins fits the profile of general regulators of apoptotic commitment and these proteins are affected by integrin activation. -An RNase protection assay demonstrates no consistent changes in the levels of RNA pertaining to any one of ten Bcl-2 family member genes in FN adhered K562 cells. In addition, the protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl , Bax, and Mcl-1 are not altered by FN adhesion in K562 cells. This is consistent with findings reported for the RPMI 8226 myeloma cell line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The ECM protein FN has been found to play a key role in the survival of a number of hematopoietic cell lines under conditions of cytotoxic stress. CML cells remaining in contact with the bone marrow may form the basis of a tumor cell population that is resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effects of chemotherapy. The cellular changes induced by the VLA-4 and VLA-5 integrin molecules seem to be mediated by &bgr;1 since each of these receptors are capable of providing cytoprotection, but not additively. In vitro, the CAM-DR phenotype also allows cells to survive the apoptosis-inducing actions of AG957, a specific inhibitor of the BCR/ABL kinase. AG957 is able to disrupt the tyrosine phosphorylation of all proteins activated by the BCR/ABL kinase in K562 cells at relatively low concentrations, leading to cell death. Integrin activation, despite providing protection against BCR/ABL inhibition, did not result in the phosphorylation of any of these proteins. Finally, it is determined that FN adhered K562 cells remain resistant to melphalan following AG957 exposure, a further indication that the mechanism of CAM-DR is independent of proteins within the BCR/ABL cell survival pathway. In conclusion, &bgr;1 integrins are implicated in the induction of drug resistance of K562 CML cells, among other hematopoietic cell lines. Small molecule antagonists against the &bgr;1 integrin subunit therefore will prove beneficial as chemosensitizers in the treatment of cancer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE THREE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> A pre-established microcrotiter adhesion assay is used to determine if bisphosphonates are effective at preventing adhesion of myeloma cells to FN. Bisphosphonates of varying potencies (etidronate, clodronate, pamidronate, zoledronate) are examined for inhibiting tumor cell adhesion to FN and other bone mar-row matrices. VLA-4 and VLA-5 are shown to play a major role in maintaining hematopoietic cells within the bone marrow and for keeping myeloma cells in an environment which promotes tumor growth and/or blocks apoptosis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> To determine if bisphosphonates are able to sensitize pre-adhered myeloma cells to cytotoxic drugs in-vitro, cells are exposed to various concentrations of bisphosphonates both before and after adhesion to FN and exposure to cytotoxic drugs. Changes in the percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis are examined by using MTT based cytotoxicity assays and Annexin V flow cytometric analysis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> To determine if bisphosphonates are able to prevent or reverse FN induced G1 cell cycle arrest cells are allowed to adhere for 24 to 48 hours before the addition of bisphosphonates. Cell cycle arrest is detected using propidium iodide and BudR cell cycle analysis as measured by flow cytometry. Presumably malignant cells are already attached to the extracellular matrix before treatment with chemotherapy. Thus, the most effective agents will reverse, as well as prevent, cell adhesion to FN </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> To investigate the effect of bisphosphonates in disrupting &bgr;1 mediated signal transduction in myeloma cells the effects of bisphosphonates on Bcl-XL expression in myeloma cells is measured using western blot and RTIPCR analysis. Results indicate that FN mediated adhesion is capable of upregulating Bcl-XL expression in myeloma cells which could block apoptosis. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the problem of chemotherapy and radiation induced drug resistance and describes methods for enhancing the efficacy of both cytotoxic drugs and radiation in the treatment of cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The tumor cell microenvironment influences the way a tumor cell behaves and responds to cytotoxic drugs. The microenvironment can enhance tumor cell survival and prevent drug-induced apoptosis. This interaction between tumor cell and environment explains how some tumor cells survive initial drug exposure and eventually express classical mechanisms of drug resistance. Two different forms of tumor cell-environment interaction are disclosed. In the first form, soluble chemical modulators, such as cytokines, are secreted by non-tumor, stromal cells. These soluble modulators interact with tumor cell surface receptors, which in turn activate signal transduction pathways that enhance tumor cell survival and prevent apoptosis. Interleukin-6 appears to be a classical example of a soluble modulator secreted by the tumor microenvironment capable of increasing tumor cell survival and preventing apoptosis. Approaches to block signal transduction pathways mediated by IL-6, or other soluble modulators of apoptosis, can enhance cytotoxic drug activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In the second form of tumor cell-environment interaction, direct tumor cell contact with other cells or the ECM is associated with drug resistance. This form of drug resistance has been given the term cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). To date, &bgr;1 integrin adhesion and activation mediates the most well characterized CAM-DR phenotype. Other cell adhesion molecules are also likely to play a role in the CAM-DR phenotype. Interrupting this cell adhesion, or the signal transduction pathways associated with it, represents a new drug target for the treatment of cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> These two forms of tumor cell-environment interaction are illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In summary, it is herein disclosed that cancer cell interaction with the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin and collagen, prevents cell death (apoptosis) induced by cytotoxic drugs and radiation, a phenomenon described as &ldquo;Cell Adhesion Mediated Drug Resistance&rdquo; (CAM-DR). Further, it is disclosed that integrin-mediated adhesion, including &agr;<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &agr;<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>for fibronectin and &agr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>for collagen, prevents both drug and radiation induced cancer cell death. Therefore, integrin-mediated adhesion confers a survival advantage to cancer cells that have been exposed to drugs or radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> It is also shown that specific agents including bisphosphonates can be utilized to inhibit integrin-mediated cell adhesion thereby rendering cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, integrin-mediated cell adhesion confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and represents a novel and specific target for the development of therapies that can interfere with or inhibit CAM-DR. Furthermore, inhibition of CAM-DR has the potential to enhance treatment responses by sensitizing cancer cells to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In particular, the use of bisphosphonate compounds for inhibiting adhesion and enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic and/or radiation treatments in the treatment of cancer is disclosed.
