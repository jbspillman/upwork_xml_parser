<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The Staphylococci make up a medically important genera of microbes known to cause several types of diseases in humans. <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>is a Gram positive organism which can be found on the skin of healthy human hosts and it is responsible for a large number of bacteremias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>has been successfully treated with the penicillin derivative Methicillin in the past, but is now becoming increasingly resistant (MRSA&mdash;Methicillin Resistant <highlight><italic>S. aureus</italic></highlight>) to this antibiotic &lsqb;Harbath et al., (1998) Arch. Intern. Med. 158:182-189&rsqb;. For example, <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>endocarditis mortality can range from 26-45%, and combined &bgr;-lactam/aminoglycoside therapy is proving increasingly ineffective in disease eradication &lsqb;R&oslash;der et al., (1999) Arch. Intern. Med. 159:462-469&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is no longer uncommon to isolate <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>strains which are resistant to most of the standard antibiotics, and thus there is an unmet medical need and demand for new anti-microbial agents, vaccines, drug screening methods, and diagnostic tests for this organism. Antibiotics can be grouped into broad classes of activities against surprisingly few targets within the cell. Generally, the target molecule is a cellular protein that provides an essential function. The inhibition of activity of the essential protein leads either to death of the bacterial cell or to its inability to proliferate. Critical cellular functions against which antibiotics are currently in use include cell wall synthesis, folate and fatty acid metabolism, protein synthesis, and nucleic acid synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A proven approach in the discovery of a new drug, referred to as target-based drug discovery to distinguish it from cell-based drug discovery, is to obtain a target protein and to develop in vitro assays to interfere with the biological function of the protein. Nucleic acid metabolism is essential for all cells. The DNA synthesis machinery includes a number of proteins that act in concert to achieve rapid and highly processive replication of the chromosome in bacteria &lsqb;reviewed in Kornberg, A., and Baker, T. A. 1992, DNA Replication, Second edition, New York: W. H. Freeman and Company, pp. 165-194; Benkovic, S. J. et al., 2001, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 70: 181-208&rsqb;. As described below for DNA polymerase III, biological machines are often comprised of multiprotein complexes. Coordinated interactions among proteins of the bacterial primosome and replisome are essential to their efficiency. Thus, any members of essential multiprotein complexes are hypothetical targets for drug development. However, the fact that a protein can be associated with a certain biological function does not necessarily imply that it represents a suitable target for the development of new drugs &lsqb;Drews J. 2000, Science 287:1960-1964&rsqb;. For instance, although DNA replication is a well-known and essential process for bacterial growth, only a relatively small number of DNA replication proteins are targeted by currently-available antibiotics. Importantly, screening of compounds for those that inhibit the function of a target must be preferably rapid and selective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There thus remains a need to identify new bacterial targets and new target domains, and more particularly <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>bacterial targets which could be used to screen for and identify antibacterial and more particularly anti-<highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>agents. There also remains a need to identify new antimicrobial agents, vaccines, drug screening methods and diagnosis and therapeutic methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to meet these and other needs. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The assays described herein may be used as initial or primary screens to detect promising lead compounds for further development. The same assays may also be used in a secondary screening assay to measure the activity of candidate compounds on a STAAU_R9 polypeptide. Often, lead compounds will be further assessed in additional, different screens. This invention also includes secondary STAAU_R9 screens which may involve biological assays utilizing <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>strains or other suitable bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Tertiary screens may involve the study of the effect of the agent in an animal. Accordingly, it is within the scope of this invention to further use an agent identified as described herein in an appropriate animal model. For example, a test compound identified as described herein (e.g., a STAAU_R9 inhibiting agent, an antisense STAAU_R9 nucleic acid molecule, a STAAU_R9-specific antibody, or a STAAU_R9-binding partner) can be used in an animal model to determine the efficacy, toxicity, or side effects of treatment with such an agent. Alternatively, an agent identified as described herein can be used in an animal model to determine the mechanism of action of such an agent.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the discovery of an essential gene and its encoded polypeptide in <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>and portions thereof useful for example in screening, diagnostics, and therapeutics. More specifically, the invention also relates to <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptides and polynucleotides as described in greater detail below, and to a pair of polynucleotides encoding a pair of interacting polypeptides, to the pair of polypeptides themselves, or interacting domains thereof. In a particular embodiment, the pair includes a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide or interacting domain thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6) and a 96 ORF 78 or interacting domain thereof. In one embodiment, the invention relates to STAAU_R9 having the nucleotide or amino acid sequence disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2, respectively. The sequences presented as SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2 represent an exemplification of the invention, since those of ordinary skill will recognize that such sequences can be usefully employed in polynucleotides in general, including ribopolynucleotides. 96 ORF 78 was described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/676,519. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The methodology of two previous inventions (U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/110,992, filed Dec. 3, 1998, and PCT International Application WO1999/IB99/02040, filed Dec. 3, 1999) has been used to identify and characterize essential polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences from <highlight><italic>S. aureus. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Thus, in a particular embodiment of the present invention, there is provided polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences isolated from <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>that can be used in a drug screening assay to identify compounds with anti-microbial activity. The polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences can be isolated using a method similar to those described herein, or using another method. In addition, such polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences can be chemically synthesized. The identification of the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 sequence as a target for a bacteriophage validates the approach of the present invention to identify bacterial targets and also validates STAAU_R9 as a key target for antibacterial drug development as well as diagnosis and treatment methods based thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of terms used in the present description, a number of definitions are provided hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The terminology &ldquo;active on&rdquo;, with reference to a particular cellular target, such as the product of a particular gene, means that the target is an important part of a cellular pathway which includes that target and that an agent or compound acts on that pathway. Thus, in some cases the agent or compound may act on a component upstream or downstream of the stated target (i.e. indirectly on the target), including a regulator of that pathway or a component of that pathway. In general, an antibacterial agent is active on an essential cellular function, often on a product of an essential gene (i.e. directly on the target). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The terminology &ldquo;active on&rdquo; also refers to a measurable effect of the compound on the target it is active on (as compared to the activity of the target in the absence of the compound). The activity referred thereto is any one of a biological activity of one of the polypeptides of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;inhibit&rdquo;, &ldquo;inhibition&rdquo;, &ldquo;inhibitor&rdquo;, and &ldquo;inhibitor&rdquo; all refer to a function of reducing a biological activity or function. Such reduction in activity or function can, for example, be in connection with a cellular component (e.g., an enzyme), or in connection with a cellular process (e.g., synthesis of a particular protein), or in connection with an overall process of a cell (e.g., cell growth). In reference to cell growth, the inhibitory effects may be bacteriocidal (killing of bacterial cells) or bacteriostatic (i.e.&mdash;stopping or at least slowing bacterial cell growth). The latter slows or prevents cell growth such that fewer cells of the strain are produced relative to uninhibited cells over a given time period. From a molecular standpoint, such inhibition may equate with a reduction in the level of, or elimination of, the transcription and/or translation and/or stability of a specific bacterial target(s), and/or reduction or elimination of activity of a particular target biomolecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terminology &ldquo;STAAU_R9 polypeptide&rdquo; or &ldquo;dnaG polypeptide&rdquo; refers to a polypeptide encompassing <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STMU_R9-derived polypeptides, variant thereof or an active domain of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9. Non-limiting examples of STAAU_R9 polypeptides include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 2, variants or fragments thereof. As used herein, the term &ldquo;active domain of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9&rdquo;, &ldquo;biologically active polypeptide of STAAU_R9&rdquo; or the like refers to a polypeptide fragment or portion of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 that retains an activity of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9. The term &ldquo;STAAU_R9 polypeptide&rdquo; is also meant to encompass <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 or an active domain of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 that is fused to another polypetide, such as a non-STAAU_R9 polypeptide sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> These include, but are not limited to, nucleotide sequences comprising all or portions of the STAAU_R9 nucleic acid depicted in SEQ ID NO:1 which are altered by the substitution, deletion or mutation of different codons that encode a functionally equivalent amino acid residue within the sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment of the present invention, and as shown in Example 3, the nucleic acid sequence can comprise a nucleotide sequence which results from deletion of at least one nucleotide at the 3&prime; end and/or at the 5&prime; end, and preferably at the 5&prime; end of the nucleic acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:1 or a derivative thereof. Thus, as well-known in the art, SEQ ID NO:1 (and its encoded polypeptide &lsqb;SEQ ID NO:2&rsqb;) can be used to generate deletion mutants. Thus, for example, the present invention provides deletion mutants of SEQ ID NO:2 (amino acids 1-599), spanning amino acids 35-599, 229-599, 380-599, 449-599, 490-599 and 561-599 (SEQ ID NO:6) of SEQ ID NO:2 which retain at least one of their biological activities. It should be understood that the deletions of a few amino acids of SEQ ID NO:6, which do not affect the biological activity of SEQ ID NO:6, are also covered by the present invention. It should be understood that the nucleic acid sequences encoding such deletion mutants are also within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;STAAU_R9 activity&rdquo; &ldquo;polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 2 activity&rdquo; &ldquo;polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 6 activity &ldquo;dnaG polypeptide activity&rdquo; or &ldquo;biological activity&rdquo; of STAAU_R9 or other polypeptides of the present invention is defined as a detectable biological activity of a gene, nucleic acid sequence, protein or polypeptide of the present invention. This includes any physiological function attributable to the specific biological activity of STAAU_R9, or phage ORF of the present invention. This includes measurement of the DNA synthesis activities of STAAU_R9 in cells or in vitro. Non-limiting examples of the biological activities may be made directly or indirectly. STAAU_R9 biological activity, for example, is not limited, however, to its function in DNA synthesis. Biological activities may also include simple binding to other factors (polypeptides or otherwise), including compounds, substrates, and of course interacting proteins. Thus, for STAAU_R9, biological activity includes any standard biochemical measurement of STMU_R9 such as conformational changes, phosphorylation status or any other feature of the protein that can be measured with techniques known in the art. STAAU_R9 biological activity also includes activities related to STAAU_R9 gene transcription or translation, or any biological activities of such transcripts or translation products. The instant invention is also concerned with STAAU_R9 interaction with an inhibitory polypeptide of the present invention, biological activity of STAAU_R9 and fragment thereof also includes assays which monitor binding and other biochemical measurements of these polypeptides. Furthermore, for certainty, the terminology &ldquo;biological activity&rdquo; also includes measurements based on the interaction of domains of interacting proteins of the present invention (i.e. the phage ORFs or domains thereof). Non-limiting examples of &ldquo;biological activity&rdquo; include one or more of the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> i) Binding to a Bacterial Growth Inhibitory ORF Derived from a Bacteriophage Including a 96 ORF 78 Polypeptide or Part Thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Determining the binding between polypeptides of the present invention can be accomplished by one of the methods described below or known in the art for determining direct binding. While it might be advantageous in certain embodiments of the present invention to provide a binding assay which is amenable to automation and more particularly to high-throughput, the present invention is not so limited. The binding or physical interaction between a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, provided herein, or fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6) and a bacteriophage protein 96 ORF 78 or portion thereof may be between isolated polypeptides consisting essentially of the sequence necessary for binding, or, alternatively, the respective polypeptide sequence may be comprised within a larger polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A number of non-limiting methods, useful in the invention, to measure the binding of bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 to a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6) are described below. Binding can be measured by coupling one molecule to a surface or support such as a membrane, a microtiter plate well, or a microarray chip, and monitoring binding of a second molecule by any number of means including but not limited to optical spectroscopy, fluorometry, and radioactive label detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> For example, Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET), in which the close proximity of two fluorophores, whether intrinsic to, as in the case of a naturally-fluorescent amino acid residue such as tryptophan, or either covalently or non-covalently bound to a separate molecule, causes the emission spectrum of one fluorophore to overlap with the excitation spectrum of the second, and thus dual fluorescence following excitation of only one fluorophore is indicative of binding. An additional assay useful in the present invention is fluorescence polarization, in which the quantifiable polarization value for a given fluorescently-tagged molecule is altered upon binding to a second molecule. Surface plasmon resonance assays can be used as a quantitative method to measure binding between two molecules by the change in mass near an immobilized sensor caused by the binding of one protein from the aqueous phase to a second immobilized on the sensor. A scintillation proximity assay can also be used to measure binding of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, and fragment thereof and a bacteriophage ORF or fragment thereof in which binding in the proximity to a scintillant converts radioactive particles into a photon signal that is detected by a scintillation counter or other detector. Additionally, binding can be evaluated by a Bio Sensor assay, which is based on the ability of the sensor to register changes in admittance induced by ion-channel modulation following binding. Phage display is also a powerful quantitative assay to measure protein:protein interaction using colourimetric ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> ii) The Stimulation of the DNA Synthesis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The terminology &ldquo;biological activity&rdquo; also relates to DNA synthesis stimulation by a polypeptide having the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 sequence provided herein, a fragment or variant thereof, or a protein comprising a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide fragment or variant thereof, that directly interacts with bacteriophage protein 96 ORF 78, or a STAAU_R9-binding fragment of the 96 ORF 78 proteins or variant thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A number of methods, useful in the invention, to measure the stimulation of DNA synthesis by a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of STAAU_R9 are described below. The level of DNA synthesis can be evaluated by, for example, the measurement of incorporation of radioactively- or fluorescently-labeled nucleotides into DNA of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>cells in an in vivo bacterial DNA replication assay, or by measuring the ratio of single-stranded (ss) to double-stranded (ds) plasmid DNA in a plasmid DNA replication assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the DNA synthesis could be measured by using soluble in vitro systems based on the use of a variety of different DNA substrates including ss DNA, either linear or circular. In one embodiment, the replication assay involves crude, enriched, or partially purified cellular protein extracts or recombinantly produced proteins. In another embodiment, the reconstituted protein assay involves partially purified or pure forms of native proteins or fusion proteins or fragments thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In one cell-free in vitro assay, an extract prepared from <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>is supplied to a plasmid substrate, for example a circular M13 ssDNA substrate, in a reaction including exogenous radiolabeled deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dATP, dTTP, dGTP and dCTP), MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and ATP. Another means to assay for STAAU_R9 activity is to measure the level of radiolabeled nucleotide incorporated into DNA in a reconstituted in vitro assay using ssDNA substrate and <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>purified proteins &lsqb;Yuhakov et al. 1999, Cell 96: 153-163&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> iii) The Activity of DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (Primase; RNA Primer Synthesis) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The biological activity also encompasses a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of a polypeptide having the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 sequence provided herein, a fragment, or a variant thereof or a protein comprising a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide or a fragment thereof that directly interacts with bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 protein or a STAAU_R9-binding fragment of the 96 ORF 78 protein, fragment, or variant thereof. A number of methods, useful in the invention, to measure the primase activity of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of STAAU_R9 are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> To assay the RNA primer synthesis activity of STAAU_R9, for example, a solid-phase immunoassay can be used. In the assay, a DNA template for primase is immobilized onto a solid support and then contacted with a reaction mixture that comprises STAAU_R9 primase and ribonucleotide triphosphates. RNA primer synthesis activity present in the mixture results in the polymerization of ribonucleotide triphosphates on the template forming a DNA-RNA heteroduplex. Typically, the heteroduplex is detected either by an antibody that is specific for such DNA-RNA hybrid regions &lsqb;Mohanram et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,038&rsqb;, or by incorporation into the newly-synthesized RNA portion of the heteroduplex of a label, such as digoxygenin, which itself is readily detected by a label-specific antibody. Bound antibodies are typically detected by a second antibody that is coupled to a chromogenic enzyme or fluorescent label, allowing for rapid quantitation of the bound antibody and thus for quantitation of the original RNA primer synthesis activity within the assay mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> iv) The Stimulation of DNA Unwinding Activity by DNA Helicase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The biological activity also relates to the activity of a polypeptide having the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>sequence provided herein, or a protein comprising a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, a fragment, or variant thereof, to stimulate <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>DnaC helicase (also referred to DnaB in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and in <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus</italic></highlight>) activity in unwinding DNA (e.g. SEQ ID NO 6). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Helicases are capable of unwinding duplex DNA with a 5&prime; to 3&prime; unwinding polarity. The following helicase assay can be adapted from an in vitro assay with DnaB helicase and DnaG primase of <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus </italic></highlight>&lsqb;Bird, L. E., Pan, H., Soultanas, P., and Wigley, D. B. (2000) Biochem. 39:171-182&rsqb;. Under the conditions of the assay described below, helicase demonstrates weak DNA unwinding activity in the absence of DnaG primase. To determine the effect of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 on the unwinding activity of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>DnaC helicase, for example, a duplex DNA substrate with a 3&prime; single-stranded (ss) DNA tail (preformed fork) is incubated with a fixed quantity of purified DnaC helicase and increasing amounts of purified STAAU_R9. The reaction mixture is subjected to conditions that support helicase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The reaction contains 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM ATP, 50 &mgr;g/ml BSA and 0.24 nM &lsqb;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;-labeled oligomer annealed to M13 ssDNA. The addition of increasing amounts of DnaG primase to DnaC helicase predictably results in the melting of the DNA duplex such that the radiolabel is separated from the M13 mp18 DNA. The separation of the oligonucleotide from the M13 mp18 DNA is readily detected by gel electrophoresis and exposure of the gels to autoradiography film. The migration of the unwound radiolabeled oligonucleotide away from the larger duplex DNA is indicative of the presence of helicase unwinding-stimulating activity in the assay mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> v) The Stimulation of the DNA Helicase ATPase Activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The biological activity also relates to stimulating the activity of a polypeptide derived from the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>primase DNA sequence provided herein, or a protein comprising a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, a fragment or a variant thereof, in stimulating the ATPase activity of DnaC helicase (e.g. SEQ ID NO 6). A number of methods, useful in the invention, to measure the DnaC ATPase stimulating activity of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of STAAU_R9 are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The ability of DnaG primase to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaC helicase can be determined in an ATPase assay in which, for example, ATP hydrolysis is measured under steady-state conditions. In the assay, ATP hydrolysis is linked to the oxidation of NADH, which provides for a convenient spectrophotometric determination of ATPase activity. Alternatively, ATPase activity is assayed indirectly by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi release assay) as a result of ATP hydrolysis by DnaC helicase. The Pi release assay mixture has a total volume of 100&mgr;L and includes DnaC helicase enzyme, DnaG primase, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, and 1 mM substrate (ATP). After the required incubation time, an equal volume of ammonium molybdate-malachite green reagent is added and the absorbance at 630 nm is measured. The presence of a candidate modulator to the mixture of DnaC helicase and DnaG primase will result in an inhibition of Pi release and will be detected as a reduction in the absorbance at 630 nm of the reaction mixture after addition of ammonium molybdate-malachite green reagent relative to a sample without the candidate inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide&rdquo; or equivalent language encompasses polynucleotides that include a sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention, particularly a bacterial polypeptide and more particularly a polypeptide of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 protein having an amino acid sequence set out in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, SEQ ID NO: 2. The term also encompasses polynucleotides that include a single continuous region or discontinuous regions encoding the polypeptide (for example, polynucleotides interrupted by integrated phage, an integrated insertion sequence, an integrated vector sequence, an integrated transposon sequence, or otherwise altered due to RNA editing or genomic DNA reorganization) together with additional regions that also may contain coding and/or non-coding sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;STAAU_R9 gene&rdquo; &ldquo;DnaG gene&rdquo; is meant to encompass a polynucleotide encoding a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide. Any additional nucleotide sequences necessary to direct transcription of RNA encoding a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, either in a cell or in vitro, will be termed &ldquo;regulatory sequences&rdquo;, which include but are not limited to transcriptional promoters and enhancers, and transcription terminators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;ORF 78&rdquo; or &ldquo;phage 96 ORF 78&rdquo; or &ldquo;96 ORF 78&rdquo; encompasses a polynucleotide represented by the sequence provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO: 3), which encodes a gene product known as the 96 ORF 78 gene product, and, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, variants thereof that encode products that retain specific binding to the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide. For example, naturally occurring variants of 96 ORF 78 that encode variants of the 96 ORF 78 gene product are included. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;polynucleotide(s)&rdquo; generally refers to any polyribonucleotide or poly-deoxyribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. &ldquo;Polynucleotide(s)&rdquo; include, without limitation, single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions or single-, double- and triple-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded, or triple-stranded regions, or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, &ldquo;polynucleotide&rdquo; as used herein refers to triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. The strands in such regions may be from the same molecule or from different molecules. The regions may include all of one or more of the molecules, but more typically involve only a region of some of the molecules. One of the molecules of a triple-helical region often is an oligonucleotide. As used herein, the term &ldquo;polynucleotide(s)&rdquo; also includes DNAs or RNAs as described above that contain one or more modified bases. Thus, DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons are &ldquo;polynucleotide(s)&rdquo; as that term is intended herein. Moreover, DNAs or RNAs comprising unusual bases, such as inosine, or modified bases, such as tritylated bases, to name just two examples, are polynucleotides as the term is used herein. It will be appreciated that a great variety of modifications have been made to DNA and RNA that serve many useful purposes known to those of skill in the art. The term &ldquo;polynucleotide(s)&rdquo; as it is employed herein embraces such chemically, enzymatically or metabolically modified forms of polynucleotides, as well as the chemical forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells, including, for example, simple and complex cells. &ldquo;Polynucleotide(s)&rdquo; also embraces short polynucleotides often referred to as oligonucleotide(s). Polynucleotides can also be DNA and RNA chimeras. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;polypeptide(s)&rdquo; refers to any peptide or protein comprising two or more amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds. &ldquo;Polypeptide(s)&rdquo; refers to both short chains, commonly referred to as peptides, oligopeptides and oligomers and to longer chains generally referred to as proteins. Polypeptides may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. &ldquo;Polypeptide(s)&rdquo; include those modified either by natural processes, such as processing and other post-translational modifications, but also by chemical modification techniques. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature, and they are well known to those of skill in the art. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degree at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains, and the amino or carboxyl termini. Modifications include, for example, acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, glycosylation, lipid attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation, selenoylation, sulfation and transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins, such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. See, for instance: Proteins&mdash;Structure and Molecular Properties, 2nd Ed., T. E. Creighton, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1993); Wold, F., Posttranslational Protein Modifications: Perspectives and Prospects, pgs. 1-12 in Posttranslational Covalent Modification of Proteins, B. C. Johnson, Ed., Academic Press, New York (1983); Seifter et al., Meth. Enzymol. 182:626-646 (1990); and Rattan et al., Protein Synthesis: Posttranslational Modifications and Aging, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 663: 48-62(1992). Polypeptides may be branched or cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched and branched circular polypeptides may result from post-translational natural processes and may be made by entirely synthetic methods, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;variant(s)&rdquo; refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that differs from a reference polynucleotide or polypeptide, respectively, but retains one or more of the biological activities of the initial (e.g. non-variant) polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention (e.g. STAAU_R9). A typical variant of a polynucleotide differs in nucleotide sequence from another reference polynucleotide. Changes in the nucleotide sequence of the variant may or may not alter the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide encoded by the reference polynucleotide. Nucleotide changes may result in amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence, or in the formation of fusion proteins, as discussed below. A typical variant of a polypeptide differs in amino acid sequence from another reference polypeptide. Generally, differences are limited so that the sequences of the reference polypeptide and the variant are closely similar overall and, in many regions, identical. A variant and reference polypeptide may differ in amino acid sequence by one or more substitutions, additions, deletions in any combination. A substituted or inserted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code. The present invention also includes variants of each of the polypeptides of the invention, that is polypeptides that vary from the referents by conservative amino acid substitutions whereby a residue is substituted by another with like characteristics. Typically, such substitutions are among Val, Leu and lie; among Ser and Thr; among the acidic residues Asp and Glu; and among the basic residues Lys and Arg; or aromatic residues Phe and Tyr. Particularly preferred are variants in which 1-10, 1-5, 1-3, 2-3, or 1 amino acid or amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination. A variant of a polynucleotide or polypeptide may be a naturally occurring such as an allelic variant, or it may be a variant that is not known to occur naturally. Non-naturally occurring variants of polynucleotides and polypeptides may be made by mutagenesis techniques, by direct synthesis, and by other recombinant methods known to skilled artisans. In one embodiment of the present invention, a variant of STAAU_R9 is thus meant to refer to a sequence thereof which diverges in the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 which is absent in SEQ ID NO:6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;fragment&rdquo;, when used in reference to a polypeptide, is a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence that is entirely the same as part but not all of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide according to the invention from which it &ldquo;derives&rdquo;. As with <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptides, fragments may be &ldquo;free-standing&rdquo; (&ldquo;consisting of&rdquo;), consisting essentially of, or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which they form a part or region, most preferably as a single continuous region in a single larger polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;isolated&rdquo;, when used in reference to a nucleic acid means that a naturally occurring sequence has been removed from its normal cellular (e.g., chromosomal) environment or is synthesized in a non-natural environment (e.g., artificially synthesized). Thus, the sequence may be in a cell-free solution or placed in a different cellular environment. The term does not imply that the sequence is the only nucleotide chain present, but that it is essentially free (about 90-95% pure at least) of non-nucleotide material naturally associated with it, and thus is distinguished from isolated chromosomes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;enriched&rdquo;, when used in reference to a polynucleotide means that the specific DNA or RNA sequence constitutes a significantly higher fraction (2-5 fold) of the total DNA or RNA present in the cells or solution of interest than in normal or diseased cells or in cells from which the sequence was originally taken. This could be caused by a person, by preferential reduction in the amount of other DNA or RNA present, or by a preferential increase in the amount of the specific DNA or RNA sequence, or by a combination of the two. However, it should be noted that enriched does not imply that there are no other DNA or RNA sequences present, just that the relative amount of the sequence of interest has been significantly increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;significantly higher fraction&rdquo; indicates that the level of enrichment is useful to the person making such an enrichment and indicates an increase in enrichment relative to other nucleic acids of at least about 2-fold, or 5- to 10-fold or even more. The term also does not imply that there is no DNA or RNA from other sources. The other source of DNA may, for example, comprise DNA from a yeast or bacterial genome, or a cloning vector such as pUC19. This term distinguishes from naturally occurring events, such as viral infection, or tumor type growths, in which the level of one mRNA may be naturally increased relative to other species of mRNA. That is, the term is meant to cover only those situations in which a person has intervened to elevate the proportion of the desired nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;purified&rdquo; in reference to nucleic acid does not require absolute purity (such as a homogeneous preparation). Instead, it represents an indication that the sequence is relatively more pure than in the natural environment (compared to the natural level, this level should be at least 2-5 fold greater, e.g., in terms of mg/mL). Individual clones isolated from a genomic or cDNA library may be purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The claimed DNA molecules obtained from these clones could be obtained directly from total DNA or from total RNA. cDNA clones are not naturally occurring, but rather are preferably obtained via manipulation of a partially purified naturally occurring substance (messenger RNA). The construction of a cDNA library from mRNA involves the creation of a synthetic substance (cDNA) and pure individual cDNA clones can be isolated from the synthetic library by clonal selection of the cells carrying the cDNA library. Thus, the process which includes the construction of a cDNA library from mRNA and isolation of distinct cDNA clones yields an approximately 10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>-fold purification of the native message over its proportion in naturally occurring cells. Thus, purification of at least one order of magnitude, preferably two or three orders, and more preferably four or five orders of magnitude is expressly contemplated. A genomic library can be used in the same way and yields the same approximate levels of purification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;isolated&rdquo;, &ldquo;enriched&rdquo;, and &ldquo;purified&rdquo; used with respect to nucleic acids, above, may similarly be used to denote the relative purity and abundance of polypeptides. These, too, may be stored in, grown in, screened in, and selected from libraries using biochemical techniques familiar in the art. Such polypeptides may be natural, synthetic or chimeric and may be extracted using any of a variety of methods, such as antibody immunoprecipitation, other &ldquo;tagging&rdquo; techniques, conventional chromatography and/or electrophoretic methods. Some of the above utilize the corresponding nucleic acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;complement&rdquo; when used in reference to a given polynucleotide sequence refers to a sequence of nucleotides which can form a double-stranded heteroduplex in which every nucleotide in the sequence of nucleotides is base-paired by hydrogen bonding to a nucleotide opposite it in the heteroduplex with the given polynucleotide sequence. The term may refer to a DNA or an RNA sequence that is the complement of another RNA or DNA sequence. As used herein, the term &ldquo;hybridizes&rdquo; refers to the formation of a hydrogen-bonded heteroduplex between two nucleic acid molecules. Generally, a given nucleic acid molecule will hybridize with its complement, or with a molecule that is sufficiently complementary to the given molecule to permit formation of a hydrogen-bonded heteroduplex between the two molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;probe&rdquo; refers to a polynucleotide of at least 15 nucleotides (nt), 20 nt, 30 nt, 40 nt, 50 nt, 75 nt, 100 nt, 200 nt, 500 nt, 1000 nt, and even up to 5000 to 10,000 nt in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Identity&rdquo; and &ldquo;similarity,&rdquo; as used herein and as known in the art, are relationships between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as the case may be, as determined by comparing the sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Amino acid or nucleotide sequence &ldquo;identity&rdquo; and &ldquo;similarity&rdquo; are determined from an optimal global alignment between the two sequences being compared. A non-limiting example of optimal global alignment can be carried-out using the Needleman&mdash;Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453). &ldquo;Identity&rdquo; means that an amino acid or nucleotide at a particular position in a first polypeptide or polynucleotide is identical to a corresponding amino acid or nucleotide in a second polypeptide or polynucleotide that is in an optimal global alignment with the first polypeptide or polynucleotide. In contrast to identity, &ldquo;similarity&rdquo; encompasses amino acids that are conservative substitutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; substitution is well-known in the art and broadly refers to a substitution which does not significantly change the chemico-physical properties of the substituted amino acid. For example, a &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; substitution is any substitution that has a positive score in the blosum62 substitution matrix (Hentikoff and Hentikoff, 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915-10919). By the statement &ldquo;sequence A is n % similar to sequence B&rdquo; is meant that n % of the positions of an optimal global alignment between sequences A and B consists of identical residues and conservative substitutions. By the statement &ldquo;sequence A is n % identical to sequence B&rdquo; is meant that n % of the positions of an optimal global alignment between sequences A and B consists of identical residues or nucleotides. Optimal global alignments in this disclosure used the following parameters in the Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> For polypeptides: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Substitution matrix: blosum62. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Gap scoring function: -A-B*LG, where A&equals;11 (the gap penalty), B&equals;1 (the gap length penalty) and LG is the length of the gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> For nucleotide sequences: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Substitution matrix: 10 for matches, 0 for mismatches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Gap scoring function: -A-B*LG where A&equals;50 (the gap penalty), B&equals;3 (the gap length penalty) and LG is the length of the gap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The term &lsquo;identity&rsquo; and &lsquo;similarity&rsquo; between sequences can be extended to their fragments. An optimal local alignment between sequences A and B is the highest scoring alignment of fragments of A and B. By the statement &ldquo;sequence A is n % similar locally to B&rdquo; is meant that n % of the positions of an optimal local alignment between sequences A and B consists of conservative substitutions and identical residues. By the statement &ldquo;sequence A is n % identical locally to B&rdquo; is meant that n % of the position of an optimal local alignment between sequences A and B consists of identical residues or nucleotides. A non-limiting example of optimal local alignment can be carried-out using the Smith-Waterman algorithm &lsqb;Smith, T. F and Waterman, M. S. 1981. Identification of common molecular subsequences. J. Mol. Biol. 147:195-197&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Of course, the above-listed parameters are but one specific example of alignment algorithm parameters. Numerous algorithms and parameters are available and known to the person of ordinary skill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Typical conservative substitutions are among Met, Val, Leu and lie; among Ser and Thr; among the residues Asp, Glu and Asn; among the residues Gin, Lys and Arg; or aromatic residues Phe and Tyr. In calculating the degree (most often as a percentage) of similarity between two polypeptide sequences, one considers the number of positions at which identity or similarity is observed between corresponding amino acid residues in the two polypeptide sequences in relation to the entire lengths of the two molecules being compared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; is meant to encompass constructions using the binding (variable) region of such an antibody, and other antibody modifications. Thus, an antibody useful in the invention may comprise a whole antibody, an antibody fragment, a polyfunctional antibody aggregate, or in general a substance comprising one or more specific binding sites from an antibody. The antibody fragment may be a fragment such as an Fv, Fab or F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragment or a derivative thereof, such as a single chain Fv fragment. The antibody or antibody fragment may be non-recombinant, recombinant or humanized. The antibody may be of an immunoglobulin isotype, e.g., IgG, IgM, and so forth. In addition, an aggregate, polymer, derivative and conjugate of an immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof can be used where appropriate. Neutralizing antibodies are especially useful according to the invention for diagnostics, therapeutics and methods of drug screening and drug design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;specific for an epitope present on a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide&rdquo;, when used in reference to an antibody, means that the antibody recognizes and binds an antigenic determinant present on a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide or fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6) according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;antigenically equivalent derivative(s)&rdquo; encompasses a polypeptide, polynucleotide, or the equivalent of either which will be specifically recognized by certain antibodies which, when raised to the protein, polypeptide or polynucleotide according to the invention, interferes with the immediate physical interaction between pathogen and mammalian host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;essential&rdquo;, when used in connection with a gene or gene product, means that the host cannot survive without, or is significantly growth compromised, in the absence or depletion of functional product. An &ldquo;essential gene&rdquo; is thus one that encodes a product that is beneficial, or preferably necessary, for cellular growth in vitro in a medium appropriate for growth of a strain having a wild-type allele corresponding to the particular gene in question. Therefore, if an essential gene is inactivated or inhibited, that cell will grow significantly more slowly than a wild-type strain or even not at all. Preferably, growth of a strain in which such a gene has been inactivated will be less than 20%, more preferably less than 10%, most preferably less than 5% of the growth rate of the wild-type, or the rate will be zero, in the growth medium. Preferably, in the absence of activity provided by a product of the gene, the cell will not grow at all or will be non-viable, at least under culture conditions similar to normal in vivo growth conditions. For example, absence of the biological activity of certain enzymes involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis can result in the lysis of cells under normal osmotic conditions, even though protoplasts can be maintained under controlled osmotic conditions. Preferably, but not necessarily, if such a gene is inhibited, e.g., with an antibacterial agent or a phage product, the growth rate of the inhibited bacteria will be less than 50%, more preferably less than 30%, still more preferably less than 20%, and most preferably less than 10% of the growth rate of the uninhibited bacteria. As recognized by those skilled in the art, the degree of growth inhibition will generally depend upon the concentration of the inhibitory agent. In the context of the invention, essential genes are generally the preferred targets of antimicrobial agents. Essential genes can encode &ldquo;target&rdquo; molecules directly or can encode a product involved in the production, modification, or maintenance of a target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;target&rdquo; refers to a biomolecule or complex of biomolecules that can be acted on by an exogenous agent or compound, thereby modulating, preferably inhibiting, growth or viability of a bacterial cell. A target may be a nucleic acid sequence or molecule, or a polypeptide or a region of a polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;signal that is generated by interaction of a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or fragments thereof to a 96 ORF 78 or fragment thereof&rdquo; or the like refers to the measurable indicator of polypeptide interaction in a binding assay, wherein the interacting polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, fragment thereof or variant thereof and 96 ORF 78, fragment thereof or variant thereof.

For example, the signal may include, but is not limited to (i) a signal resulting from binding of 96 ORF 78 to a STAAU_R9 polypeptide, including a fluorescence signal (time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay; fluorescence polarization assay), spectrophotometer absorbance measurement of a colourimetric signal (phage display ELISA), mass change measurement (surface plasmon resonance analysis), or a viability measurement on selective medium (yeast two-hybrid analysis); or (ii) a reduction of a radiolabeled signal (DNA synthesis assay). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;standard&rdquo;, used in reference to polypeptide activity, means the amount of activity observed or detected (directly or indirectly) in a given assay performed in the absence of a candidate compound. A &ldquo;standard&rdquo; serves as a reference to determine the effect, positive or negative, of a candidate compound on polypeptide activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;increase in activity&rdquo; refers to an enhanced level of measurable activity of a polypeptide in a given assay in the presence of a candidate compound relative to the measurable level of activity in the absence of a candidate compound. Activity is considered increased according to the invention if it is at least 10% greater, 20% greater, 50% greater, 75% greater, 100% greater or more, up to 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold or more than in the absence of a candidate compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;decrease in activity&rdquo; refers to a reduced level of measurable activity of a polypeptide in a given assay in the presence of a candidate compound relative to the measurable level of activity in the absence of a candidate compound. Activity is considered decreased according to the invention if it is at least 10% less, preferably 15% less, 20% less, 50% less, 75% less, or even 100% less (i.e., no activity) than that observed in the absence of a candidate compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;conditions that permit their interaction&rdquo;, when used in reference to a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or fragments thereof, and a candidate compound means that the two entities are placed together, whether both in solution or with one immobilized or restricted in some way and the other in solution, wherein the parameters (e.g., salt, detergent, protein or candidate compound concentration, temperature, and redox potential, among others) of the solution are such that the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or fragments thereof, and the candidate compound may physically associate. Conditions that permit protein:candidate interaction include, for example, the conditions described herein for TR-FRET, fluorescent polarization, Surface Plasmon Resonance and Phage display assays. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;antibacterial agent&rdquo; or &ldquo;antibacterial compound&rdquo; refers to an agent or compound that has a bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic effect on one or more bacterial strains, preferably such an agent or compound is bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic on at least <highlight><italic>S. aureus. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;synthesizing&rdquo; refers to a process of chemically synthesizing a compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> As used in the context of treating a bacterial infection a &ldquo;therapeutically effective amount&rdquo;, &ldquo;pharmaceutically effective amount&rdquo; or &ldquo;amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic effect&rdquo; indicates an amount of an antibacterial agent which has a therapeutic effect. This generally refers to the inhibition, to some extent, of the normal cellular functioning of bacterial cells required for continued bacterial infection. Further, as used herein, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of an antibacterial agent that produces the desired therapeutic effect as judged for example by clinical trial results and/or animal models. This amount can be routinely determined by one skilled in the art and will vary depending on several factors, such as the particular bacterial strain involved and the particular antibacterial agent used. In the same context, an &ldquo;amount sufficient to reduce adhesion&rdquo; of a bacterium to a tissue or tissue surface indicates an amount of an antibacterial agent that is effective for prophylactically preventing or reducing the extent of bacterial infection of the given tissue or tissue surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As used in the context of treating a bacterial infection, contacting or administering the antimicrobial agent &lsquo;in combination with existing antimicrobial agents&rsquo; refer to a concurrent contacting or administration of the active compound with antibiotics to provide a bactericidal or growth inhibitory effects beyond the individual bactericidal or growth inhibitory effects of the active compound or the antibiotic. Existing antibiotic refers for example to the group consisting of penicillins, cephalosporins, imipenem, monobactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, trimethoprim/sulfonamide, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, vancomycin, polymyxins, chloramphenicol and lincosamides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;tissue&rdquo; refers to an aggregation of cells of one or more cell types which together perform one or more specific functions in an organism. As used herein, a &ldquo;tissue surface&rdquo; refers to that portion of a tissue that forms a boundary between a given tissue and other tissues or the surroundings of the tissue. A tissue surface may refer to an external surface of an animal, for example the skin or cornea, or, alternatively, the term may refer to a surface that is either internal, for example, the lining of the gut, or to a surface that is exposed to the outside surroundings of the animal only as the result of an injury or a surgical procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;measuring the binding of a candidate compound&rdquo; refers to the use of an assay permitting the quantitation of the amount of a candidate compound physically associated with a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, fragment or variant thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;candidate compound&rdquo; as used herein, is any compound with a potential to modulate the expression or activity of a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;simultaneously&rdquo; when used in connection with the assays of the present invention, refers to the fact that the specified components or actions at least overlap in time, and is thus not restricted to the fact that the initiation and termination points are identical. For certainty, a simultaneous contact of a STAAU_R9 polypeptide with a candidate compound and a bacteriophage polypeptide is an overlap in contact periods, which can but does not necessarily reflect the fact that the latter two are introduced into an assay mixture at the exact same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;directly or indirectly detectably labeled&rdquo; refers to the attachment of a moiety to a candidate compound that renders the candidate compound either directly detectable (e.g., an isotope or a fluorophore) or indirectly detectable (e.g., an enzyme activity, allowing detection in the presence of an appropriate substrate, or a specific antigen or other marker allowing detection by addition of an antibody or other specific indicator). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;method of screening&rdquo; refers to a method for evaluating a relevant activity or property of a large plurality of compounds, rather than just one or a few compounds. For example, a method of screening can be used to conveniently test at least 100, more preferably at least 1000, still more preferably at least 10,000, and most preferably at least 100,000 different compounds, or even more. In a particular embodiment, the method is amenable to automated, cost-effective high throughput screening on libraries of compounds for lead development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In a related aspect or in preferred embodiments, the invention provides a method of screening for potential antibacterial agents by determining whether any of a plurality of compounds, preferably a plurality of small molecules, is active on STAAU_R9. Preferred embodiments include those described for the above aspect, including embodiments which involve determining whether one or more test compounds bind to or reduce the level of activity of a bacterial target, and embodiments which utilize a plurality of different targets as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;compounds&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to, small organic molecules, peptides, polypeptides and antibodies that bind to a polynucleotide and/or polypeptide of the invention, such as for example inhibitory ORF gene product or target thereof, and thereby inhibit, extinguish or enhance its activity or expression. Potential compounds may be small organic molecules, a peptide, a polypeptide such as a closely related protein or antibody that binds the same site(s) on a binding molecule, such as a bacteriophage gene product, thereby preventing bacteriophage gene product from binding to STAAU_R9 polypeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;compounds&rdquo; also potentially includes small molecules that bind to and occupy the binding site of a polypeptide, thereby preventing binding to cellular binding molecules, such that normal biological activity is prevented. Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small organic molecules, peptides or peptide-like molecules. Preferred potential compounds include compounds related to and variants of inhibitory ORF products encoded by a bacteriophage and of STAAU_R9 and any homologues and/or peptido-mimetics and/or fragments thereof. Other examples of potential polypeptide antagonists include antibodies or, in some cases, oligonucleotides or proteins which are closely related to the ligands, substrates, receptors, enzymes, etc., as the case may be, of the polypeptide, e.g., a fragment of the ligands, substrates, receptors, enzymes, etc.; or small molecules which bind to the polypeptide of the present invention but do not elicit a response, so that the activity of the polypeptide is prevented. Other potential compounds include antisense molecules (see Okano, 1991 J. Neurochem. 56, 560; see also &ldquo;Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression&rdquo;, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988), for a description of these molecules). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;small molecule&rdquo; refers to compounds having molecular mass of less than 3000 Daltons, preferably less than 2000 or 1500, still more preferably less than 1000, and most preferably less than 600 Daltons. Preferably but not necessarily, a small molecule is not an oligopeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;mimetic&rdquo; refers to a compound that can be natural, synthetic, or chimeric and is structurally and functionally related to a reference compound. In terms of the present invention, a &ldquo;peptidomimetic,&rdquo; for example, is a non-peptide compound that mimics the activity-related aspects of the 3-dimensional structure of a peptide or polypeptide, for example a compound that mimics the structure of a peptide or active portion of a phage- or bacterial ORF-encoded polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;bacteriophage inhibitor protein&rdquo; refers to a protein encoded by a bacteriophage nucleic acid sequence, which inhibits bacterial function in a host bacterium. Thus, it is a bacteria-inhibiting phage product. The term &ldquo;bacteriophage inhibitor protein&rdquo; encompasses a fragment, derivative, or active portion of a bacteriophage inhibitor protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In more than one embodiment of the above assay methods of the present invention, it may be desirable to immobilize either STAAU_R9 or its target molecule or ligand to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of one or both of the proteins or polypeptides, as well as to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding of a test compound to a STAAU_R9 protein (or fragment, or variant thereof) or interaction of a STAAU_R9 protein with a target molecule or ligand in the presence and absence of a candidate compound, can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing the reactants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Examples of such vessels include microtitre plates, test tubes and micro-centrifuge tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment a fusion protein can be provided which adds a domain that allows one or both of the proteins to be bound to a matrix. For example, glutathione-S-transferase/STAAU_R9 fusion proteins or glutathione-S-transferase/target fusion proteins (e.g. glutathione-S-transferase/96 ORF 78) can be adsorbed onto glutathione sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) or glutathione derivatized microtitre plates, which are then combined with the test compound or the test compound and either the non-adsorbed target protein or STAAU_R9 protein and the mixture incubated under conditions conducive to complex formation (e.g. at physiological conditions for salt and pH). Following incubation the beads or microtitre plate wells are washed to remove any unbound components, the matrix immobilized in the case of beads, complex determined either directly or indirectly, for example, as described above. Alternatively, the complexes can be dissociated from the matrix, and the level of STAAU_R9 binding or activity determined using standard techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Other techniques for immobilizing proteins on matrices (and well-known in the art) can also be used in the screening assays of the invention. For example, either a STAAU_R9 protein or a STAAU_R9 target molecule or ligand can be immobilized utilizing conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Biotinylated STAAU_R9 protein or target molecules or ligand can be prepared from biotin-NHS (N-hydroxy-succinimide) using techniques known in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, Ill.), and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin-coated 96 well plates (Pierce Chemical). Alternatively, antibodies reactive with target molecules or ligand but which do not interfere with binding of the STAAU_R9 protein (or part thereof to its target molecule or ligand can be derivatized to the wells of the plate, and unbound target or STAAU_R9 protein trapped in the wells by antibody conjugation. Methods for detecting such complexes, in addition to those described above for the GST-immobilized complexes, include immunodetection of complexes using antibodies reactive with the STAAU_R9 protein or target molecule, as well as enzyme-linked assays which rely on detecting an enzymatic activity associated with the STAAU_R9 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;active portion&rdquo;, when refering to a bacteriophage-derived sequence, relates to an epitope, a catalytic or regulatory domain, or a fragment of a bacteriophage inhibitor protein that is responsible for, or a significant factor in, bacterial target inhibition. The active portion preferably may be removed from its contiguous sequences and, in isolation, still effect inhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;treating a bacterial infection&rdquo; refers to a process whereby the growth and/or metabolic activity of a bacterium or bacterial population in a host, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human, is inhibited or ablated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;bacterium&rdquo; refers to a single bacterial strain and includes a single cell and a plurality or population of cells of that strain unless clearly indicated to the contrary. In reference to bacteria or bacteriophage, the term &ldquo;strain&rdquo; refers to bacteria or phage having a particular genetic content. The genetic content includes genomic content as well as recombinant vectors. Thus, for example, two otherwise identical bacterial cells would represent different strains if each contained a vector, e.g., a plasmid, with different inserts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;diagnosing&rdquo; refers to the identification of an organism or strain of an organism responsible for a bacterial infection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;infection with <highlight><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></highlight>&rdquo; refers to the presence, growth or proliferation of cells of a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>strain within, or on a surface of, an animal, such as a mammal, preferably a human. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;bacteriophage 96 ORF 78-encoded polypeptide&rdquo; refers to a polypeptide encoded by SEQ ID NO: 3 or to a fragment or derivative thereof encompassing an active portion of a bacteriophage 96 ORF 78-encoded polypeptide of sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 4. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;detectable marker&rdquo;, when used in the context of a yeast two-hybrid assay, refers to a polypeptide that confers a trait upon a cell expressing that polypeptide that signals the presence or amount of that polypeptide expressed.

<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The methodology used to identify the STAAU_R9 polypeptide is described in detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/110,992, filed Dec. 3, 1998, and PCT International Application W01999/IB99/02040, filed Dec. 3, 1999. Briefly, this PCT application concerns bacteriophages that can infect a selected bacterium. The sequencing and characterization of the phage genetic information allow the identification of all open reading frames (ORFs) encoded by the phage, including those that are essential or instrumental in inhibiting their host. Each ORF is identified using computer softwares and individually expressed in the host. The effect of this expression on host viability is then measured. Identification of ORFs from the phage genome which inhibit the host bacterium both provides a compound that could be used as a bacterial inhibitor compound per se (or derivatized or modified to obtain further inhibitors) and as a tool for the identification of the bacterial target affected by the phage-encoded inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Using methodology described in detail in Example 1 and 2, a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>polypeptide that specifically bound the bacterial growth inhibitory 96 phage ORF 78 protein was isolated. Briefly, the 96 ORF 78 protein was used as a ligand in an affinity chromatography binding step with <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>protein extract. The selected <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>interacting polypeptide was purified and further analyzed by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry using MALDI-ToF technology &lsqb;Qin, J., et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>69:3995-4001&rsqb;. Computational analysis (http://prowl.rockfeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound) of the mass spectrum obtained identifies the corresponding ORF in the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>nucleotide sequence in the University of Oklahoma <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>genomic database at http://www.genome.ou.edu/staph.html. The interaction between 96 ORF 78 and the candidate target protein, herein referred as STAAU_R9 or fragment thereof, was also confirmed in a yeast two-hybrid assay. The interactions between bacterial STAAU_R9 or fragment thereof and 96 ORF 78 were further characterized using affinity blotting and surface plasmon resonance assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The sequence similarity between individual members of evolutionarily distant members of a protein family is usually not randomly distributed along the entire length of the sequence but is often clustered into &ldquo;domains&rdquo;. These correspond to conserved three-dimensional folds that form catalytic and/or regulatory structures that perform the important biochemical function of the group of proteins. Commercially and publicly available computer software programs can identify such motifs and domains in a new query sequence, providing additional functional information for the query sequence. Such motifs and folds are themselves deposited in public databases which can be directly accessed (for example, SwissProt database; 3D-ALI at EMBL, Heidelberg; Pfam; Blocks: PROSITE). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 identified in the phage 96 ORF 78 binding studies was compared with all other sequences in the public domain databases. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, results revealed that STAAU_R9 is related to a large number of bacterial DNA primases, including those of <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus </italic></highlight>(34% identity), <highlight><italic>B. subtilis </italic></highlight>(36% identity) and <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(27% identity). More specifically, STAAU_R9 is highly related to the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>strain 912 DNA primase (gi&verbar;2494147&verbar;sp&verbar;O05338&verbar;PRIM_STAAU DNA PRIMASE) with a 92% amino acid identity and 93% similarity at the amino acid level across the entire sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The results of a Hidden Markov Model searching analysis of the STAAU_R9 amino acid sequence revealed the presence of two highly related Pfam motifs in the STAAU_R9 region spanning amino acids 1 to 339 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>). A N-terminal CHC2 zinc finger domain extends from the amino acids position 3 to 100, and the Toprim domain, located centrally (amino acid position 260 to 339), corresponds to a conserved catalytic domain in bacterial DnaG-type primases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Function of DNA Primase </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid metabolism is essential for all cells. The DNA synthesis machinery includes a number of proteins that act in concert to achieve rapid and highly processive replication of the chromosome in bacteria &lsqb;reviewed in Kornberg, A., and Baker, T. A. 1992, <highlight><italic>DNA Replication, </italic></highlight>Second edition, New York: W. H. Freeman and Company, pp. 165-194&rsqb;. Coordinated interactions among proteins of the bacterial primosome and replisome are essential to its efficiency. DNA primases play an essential role in chromosome replication because in addition to initiating leading-strand synthesis, they synthesize short RNA primers on the lagging strand and thus allow for replication of the lagging strand during chromosomal replication. The primase genes of both <highlight><italic>B. subtilis </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>dnaG, were isolated in studies with conditionally-lethal temperature-sensitive DNA replication mutants &lsqb;Rowen, L. and Kornberg, A. 1978, J. Biol. Chem. 253:758-64; Alonso, J. C. et al. 1988, Mol. Gen. Genet. 214: 482-489&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DnaG interacts with the replicative DNA helicase, DnaB, within the primosome to achieve regulated synthesis of RNA primers used to prime DNA synthesis of the lagging strand. DNA helicase is thought to unwind duplex DNA progressively and allow for binding of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme necessary for DNA synthesis. The DnaG primase of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>comprises two functional domains: a N-terminal 49 kDa domain that retains template recognition- and primase activities in replication assays; and a C-terminal 16 kDa domain that is required for functional interaction with DnaB &lsqb;Tougu, K., et al. 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:4675-4682; Lu, Y.-B., et al. 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93:12902-12907&rsqb;. Further delimitation of the DnaB helicase-binding region of DnaG primase revealed that only the C-terminal 16 amino acids of DnaG are required for functional interaction with <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DnaB &lsqb;Tougu, K., and Marians, K. J. 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271:21398-21405&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Extensive characterization of the interactions between DnaG primase and DnaB helicase of <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus </italic></highlight>&lsqb;Bird, L. E., et al. 2000, Biochem. 39:171-182&rsqb; stemmed from the observation that the two proteins form a stable complex in vitro. Systematic truncation of <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus </italic></highlight>primase and helicase, using limited proteolysis and PCR mutagenesis, followed by gel filtration and biochemical assays revealed that the C-terminal domain of primase is sufficient to interact with DnaB and to stimulate the ATPase and helicase activities of DnaB helicase. Although it has not been tested directly, the N-terminus of <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus </italic></highlight>primase contains signature primase domains and thus the organization of <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus </italic></highlight>primase is likely to match that of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>primase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In addition to its interactions with helicase, primase also undergoes physical interactions with the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (DNA Pol III HE) &lsqb;Wu, C. A., et al. 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267:4074-4083&rsqb;. The association of primase with the DNA Pol III HE during primer synthesis regulates its catalytic activity and this regulatory interaction occurs independently of formation of a preinitiation complex of the DNA Pol III HE on the primer terminus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DnaG primase also binds to the single-stranded DNA binding protein SSB within the replication fork. The primase-SSB interaction is essential for tight association between primase and the nascent RNA primer. However, in order for the DNA polymerase III &bgr; subunit, the sliding clamp, to be assembled onto the primed site, primase must first be displaced from its RNA primer. This displacement function is mediated by a single subunit of the DNA Pol III HE, chi, in conjunction with SSB &lsqb;Yuzhakov, A., et al. 1999, Cell 96:153-163&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> In summary, <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>primase has been shown to interact with several members of the DNA replication machinery, namely helicase, the DNA Pol III HE, and SSB. Binding sites on DnaG for its interaction with the DNA Pol III HE and with SSB are poorly understood at present. In Gram-positive bacteria such as <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus, </italic></highlight>DnaG primase was shown to contain three domains: a) a 12 kDa N-terminal zinc-binding domain which is central for its ability to recognize template DNA; b) a 36 kDa catalytic core domain essential to polymerize ribonucleotides on a DNA template; and c) a C-terminal 15 kDa DnaB-binding domain which allows interaction with helicase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The cellular functions and the binding partners of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 are still unclear and could at best be suggested from polypeptide similarities with the other bacterial primases. Based on sequence analysis, <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 likely contains a) an N-terminal zinc-binding domain that could be involved in template DNA recognition; and b) a central catalytic core domain. As shown from the optimal global alignment analysis of amino acid sequence of STAAU_R9-related proteins, the C-terminal region of STAAU_R9 is only weakly conserved amongst bacterial DNA primases (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Homologues of DnaG have been identified in all prokaryotes studied to date and in several bacteriophages. Based on comparative sequence analyses, these primases appear structurally distinct from the primases that are essential to archaeal and eukaryotic chromosome replication. It is therefore difficult to predict a priori which of the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>DnaG interactions, if any, could be targeted by a compound that would inhibit primase activity, namely ribonucleotide polymerization on a DNA template, stimulation of helicase unwinding activity, stimulation of helicase ATPase activity, or binding to other cellular components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, despite the demonstration of protein-protein interactions of primase with helicase, with DNA Pol III HE, and with SSB in vitro, and despite evidence that these interactions within the primosome are critical to obtaining efficient primase activities and chromosome replication in vivo &lsqb;Lu, Y.,et al. 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93:12902-12907&rsqb;, there are currently no available drugs directed against primase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The demonstration that bacteriophage have adapted to inhibiting a host bacterium by acting on a particular cellular component or target provides a strong indication that this component is an appropriate target for developing and using antibacterial agents, e.g. in therapeutic treatments. The present invention provides additional guidance over mere identification of bacterial essential genes, as the present invention also provides an indication of accessibility of the target to an inhibitor, and an indication that the target is sufficiently stable over time (e.g., not subject to high rates of mutation) as phage acting on that target were able to develop and persist. Thus the present invention identifies STAAU_R9, and more particularly, a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6, as an appropriate target for development of antibacterial agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> Identification of the Surface of Interaction on STAAU_R9 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> This invention relates, in part, to a specific interaction between a growth-inhibitory protein encoded by the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>bacteriophage genome and an essential <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>protein. In one embodiment, this interaction forms the basis for drug screening assays. More specifically, the invention relates to the interacting domains of the protein encoded by the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 and the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 proteins, forming the basis for screening assays. The invention provides a method for the identification of 96 ORF 78 and, more preferably, STAAU_R9 polypeptide fragments which are involved in the interaction between STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Several approaches and techniques known to those skilled in the art can be used to identify and to characterize interacting fragments of STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78. These fragments may include, for example, truncation polypeptides having a portion of an amino acid sequence of any of the two proteins, or variants thereof, such as a continuous series of residues that includes an amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Fragments of STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78 can be cloned by genetic recombinant technology and tested for interaction using a yeast two-hybrid assay as exemplified below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Partial proteolysis of proteins in solution is one method to delineate the domain boundaries in multi-domain proteins. By subjecting proteins to limited digestion, the most accessible cleavage sites are preferentially hydrolyzed. These cleavage sites preferentially reside in less structured regions which include loops and highly mobile areas typical of the joining amino acids between highly structured domains. Purified STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78 proteins can be subjected to partial proteolysis. The proteolysis can be performed with low concentrations of proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and Asp-N) with STAAU_R9 or 96 ORF 78 in solution, resulting in the generation of defined proteolytic products as observed by SDS-PAGE. An acceptable concentration and reaction time is defined by the near complete conversion of the full-length protein to stable proteolytic products. The proteolytic products are then subjected to affinity chromatography containing the appropriated partner of interaction (96 ORF 78_or STAAU_R9 purified proteins) to determine a protein sub-region able to interact. Interacting domains are identified by mass spectrometry to determine both the intact fragment mass and the completely digested with trypsin (by in-gel digestion) to better determine the amino acid residues contained within the partial proteolytic fragment. Using both sets of data, the amino acid sequence of the partial proteolytic fragment can be precisely determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Another approach is based on peptide screening using different portions of 96 ORF 78 or STAAU_R9 to identify minimal peptides from each polypeptide that are able to disrupt the interaction between the two proteins. It is assumed that fragments able to prevent interaction between STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78 correspond to domains of interaction located on either of the two interacting proteins. The different peptide fragments can be screened as competitors of interaction in protein: protein binding assays such as the ones described below. Fine mapping of interaction site(s) within a protein can be performed by an extensive screen of small overlapping fragments or peptides spanning the entire amino acid sequence of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Suitable STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78-derived amino acid fragments representative of the complete sequence of both proteins can be obtained by chemical synthesis. For instance, in the multipin approach, peptides are simultaneously synthesized by the assembly of small quantities of peptides (ca. 50 nmol) on plastic pins derivatized with an ester linker based on glycolate and 4-(hydroxymethyl) benzoate &lsqb;Maeji 1991 Pept Res, 4:142-6&rsqb;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> It is most preferred that a polypeptide of the invention is derived from <highlight><italic>S. aureus, </italic></highlight>however, it may be obtained from other organisms of the same taxonomic genus. A polypeptide of the invention may also be obtained, for example, from organisms of the same taxonomic family or order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Fragments of STAAU_R9 also are included in the invention. These fragments may include, for example, truncation polypeptides having a portion of an amino acid sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO: 2), a fragment or a variant thereof, such as a continuous series of residues that includes an amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence. Degradation forms of the polypeptides of the invention produced by or in a host cell, particularly <highlight><italic>S. aureus</italic></highlight>, are also preferred. Further preferred are fragments characterized by structural or functional attributes such as fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix-forming regions, beta-sheet and beta-sheet-forming regions, turn and turn-forming regions, coil and coil-forming regions, hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions, substrate binding region, and high antigenic index regions. Fragments of STAAU_R9 may be expressed as fusion proteins with other proteins or protein fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Preferred fragments also include an isolated polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 10, 15, 20, 30, 39, 50, 100, or 200 or more contiguous amino acids from the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 10, 15, 20, 25 or more contiguous amino acids from the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6, wherein such preferred fragments retain at least one biological activity of a STAAU_R9 polypeptide.

In preferred embodiments the polypeptide is a fragment of full-length STAAU_R9 polypeptide (or variant thereof that includes the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6 (or a variant). Preferably the fragment includes up to 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5% of the full-length sequence. Such fragments include for example, fragments in which 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, or 90% or more of the amino acids from the N-terminal end of the full-length polypeptide are deleted. Additional embodiments include fragments of SEQ ID NO. 6, e.g., fragments represented by deleting 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acids from one or both ends of SEQ ID NO. 6, but highly preferably the fragment retains specific interaction (e.g., binding) to 96 ORF 78. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Also preferred are biologically &ldquo;active&rdquo; fragments which are those fragments that mediate activities of <highlight><italic>S. aureus STAAU</italic></highlight>_R9, including those with a similar activity or an improved activity, or with a decreased undesirable activity. Also included are those fragments that are antigenic or immunogenic in an animal, especially in a human. Particularly preferred are fragments comprising domains that confer a function essential for viability of <highlight><italic>S. aureus. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Fragments of the polypeptides of the invention may be employed for producing the corresponding full-length polypeptide by peptide synthesis; therefore, these variants may be employed as intermediates for producing the full-length polypeptides of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>Polynucleotides </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The invention likewise provides polynucleotides that encode STAAU_R9 polypeptides, particularly polynucleotides that encode the polypeptide herein designated <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9, or other STAAU_R9 polypeptides described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, a polynucleotide, highly preferably isolated, enriched, or purified, is provided that comprises a region encoding a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, the polynucleotide comprising a sequence set out in SEQ ID NO: 1. Such a polynucleotide encodes a full length STAAU_R9 gene, a fragment or a variant thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6). It is contemplated that this full-length gene is essential to the growth and/or survival of an organism which possesses it, such as <highlight><italic>S. aureus. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> As a further aspect of the invention there are provided isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding and/or expressing a fragment of a full-length STAAU_R9 polypeptide, particularly a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, a fragment or a variant thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6). Further embodiments of the invention include biologically, diagnostically, prophylactically, clinically or therapeutically useful polynucleotides, polypeptides, variants thereof, and compositions comprising same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide of the invention can be obtained using <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>cells as starting material, the nucleotide sequence information disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1, and standard cloning and screening methods, such as those for cloning and sequencing chromosomal DNA fragments from bacteria. For example, to obtain a polynucleotide sequence of the invention, such as the polynucleotide sequence disclosed as in SEQ ID NO: 1, a library of clones of chromosomal DNA of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>or another suitable host is probed with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide, preferably a 17-mer or longer, derived from a partial sequence. Clones carrying DNA identical to that of the probe can be distinguished using stringent hybridization conditions. As herein used, the terms &ldquo;stringent conditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;stringent hybridization conditions&rdquo; mean hybridization occurring only if there is at least 95% and preferably at least 97% identity between the sequences. A specific example of stringent hybridization conditions is of an overnight incubation of a hybridization support (e.g., a nylon or nitrocellulose membrane) at 42&deg; C. in a solution comprising: 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cpm/ml labeled probe, 50% formamide, 5&times;SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5&times;Denhardt&apos;s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 micrograms/ml of denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the hybridization support in 0.1&times;SSC at 65&deg; C. Hybridization and wash conditions are well known to those skilled in the art and are exemplified in Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989), particularly Chapter 11 therein. Solution hybridization may also be used with the polynucleotide sequences provided by the invention. By sequencing the individual clones thus identified by hybridization, it is possible to confirm the identity of the clone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an amplification process can be utilized to isolate the polynucleotide. In this approach, the sequence disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 1 is targeted by two oligonucleotides, one identical to a sequence on the coding DNA strand at or upstream of the ATG initiation codon and the other which anneals to the opposite strand at or downstream of the stop codon. Priming from these oligonucleotides in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) yields a full-length gene coding sequence. Such suitable techniques are described by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). Many variations of the basic technique are well-known to those familiar with PCR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the present invention provides for an isolated polynucleotide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of: (a) a polynucleotide sequence which has at least 60% identity, preferably at least 70% identity, more preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95%, most preferably at least 97-99%, or exact identity, to that of SEQ ID NO: 1; (b) a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide which has at least 40% identity, preferably at least 50% identity, preferably at least 60% identity, more preferably at least 70% identity, more preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 90%, yet more preferably at least 95%, most preferably at least 97-99% or exact identity to SEQ ID NO: 2 over the entire length of SEQ ID NO: 2; or the complement of a sequence of (a) or (b) above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention provides for an isolated polynucleotide comprising or consisting of: (a) a polynucleotide sequence which has at least 60% identity, preferably at least 70% identity, more preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95%, most preferably at least 97-99% or exact identity, to that of SEQ ID NO: 5; (b) a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide which has at least 35% identity, preferably at least 40% identity, preferably at least 50% identity, preferably at least 60% identity, more preferably at least 70% identity, more preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 90%, yet more preferably at least 95%, most preferably at least 97-99% or exact identity to SEQ ID NO: 6; or the complement of a sequence of (a) or (b). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a polynucleotide sequence identical over its entire length to the coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. Also provided by the invention is a coding sequence for a mature polypeptide or a fragment thereof by itself as well as a coding sequence for a mature polypeptide or a fragment in reading frame with another coding sequence, such as a sequence encoding a leader or secretory sequence, a pre-, or pro-, or prepro-protein sequence. The polynucleotide of the invention may also contain at least one non-coding sequence, including for example, but not limited to at least one non-coding 5&prime; and 3&prime; sequence, such as the transcribed but non-translated sequences, termination signals (such as rho-dependent and rho-independent termination signals), ribosome binding sites, Kozak sequences, sequences that stabilize or destabilize mRNAs, introns, and polyadenylation signals. The polynucleotide sequence may also comprise additional coding sequence encoding additional amino acids. For example, a marker sequence that facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide can be encoded. In certain embodiments of the invention, the marker sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, as provided in the pQE vector (Qiagen, Inc.) and described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 86: 821-824 (1989), or an HA peptide tag &lsqb;Wilson et al., Cell 37: 767 (1984)&rsqb;, both of which may be useful in purifying polypeptide sequences fused to them. Polynucleotides of the invention also include, but are not limited to, polynucleotides comprising a structural gene and its naturally associated sequences that control gene expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> While it is most preferred that a polynucleotide of the invention be derived from <highlight><italic>S. aureus, </italic></highlight>it may also be obtained from other organisms of the same taxonomic genus. A polynucleotide of the invention may also be obtained, for example, from organisms of the same taxonomic family or order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Further preferred embodiments are polynucleotides encoding <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 variants that have the amino acid sequence of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 in which several, a few, 5 to 10, 1 to 5, 1 to 3, 2, 1 or no amino acid residues are substituted, modified, deleted and/or added, in any combination. Further preferred embodiments are polynucleotides encoding <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 variants that have the amino acid sequence of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 6 in which several, a few, 5 to 10, 1 to 5, 1 to 3, 2, 1 or no amino acid residues are substituted, modified, deleted and/or added, in any combination. Especially preferred among these polynucleotides are those encoding silent nucleotide alterations that do not alter the coding sequence or activities of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptides they encode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the polynucleotide encodes a STAAU_R9 polypeptide having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:6 and in which several, a few, 5 to 10, 1 to 5, 1 to 3, 2 or 1 amino acid residues are substituted, modified, deleted and/or added, in any combination, in the sequence or sequences surrounding the sequence encoding SEQ ID NO:6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments are polynucleotides encoding polypeptides that retain substantially the same biological function or activity as the mature polypeptide encoded by a DNA of SEQ ID NO: 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> In accordance with certain preferred embodiments of this invention there are provided polynucleotides that hybridize, particularly under stringent conditions, to <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polynucleotide sequences, such as those polynucleotides in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides of the invention are useful as hybridization probes for RNA, cDNA and genomic DNA to isolate full-length cDNAs and genomic clones encoding genes that have a high degree of sequence identity to the STAAU_R9 gene. Such probes generally will comprise at least 15 to about 100 residues or base pairs, although such probes will preferably have about 20 to 50 nucleotide residues or base pairs. Particularly preferred probes are about 20 to about 30 nucleotide residues or base pairs in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> A coding region of a related STAAU_R9 gene from a bacterial species other than <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>may be isolated by screening a library using a DNA sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 1 to synthesize an oligonucleotide probe. A labeled oligonucleotide having a sequence complementary to that of a gene of the invention is then used to screen a library of cDNA, genomic DNA or mRNA to determine to which member(s) of the library the probe hybridizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> There are several methods available and well known to those skilled in the art to obtain full-length DNAs, or extend short DNAs, for example those based on the method of Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) &lsqb;see, for example, Frohman, et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:8998-9002, 1988&rsqb;. Recent modifications of the technique, exemplified by the MARATHON&trade; technology (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) for example, have significantly simplified the search for longer cDNAs. In the MARATHON technology, cDNAs are prepared from mRNA extracted from a chosen cell and an &lsquo;adaptor&rsquo; sequence is ligated onto each end. Nucleic acid amplification by PCR is then carried out to amplify the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; 5&prime; end of the DNA using a combination of gene specific and adaptor specific oligonucleotide primers. The PCR reaction is then repeated using &ldquo;nested&rdquo; primers, that is, primers designed to anneal within the amplified product (typically an adaptor-specific primer that anneals further 3&prime; in the adaptor sequence and a gene-specific primer that anneals further 5&prime; in the selected gene sequence). The products of this reaction can then be analyzed by DNA sequencing and a full-length DNA constructed either by joining the product directly to the existing DNA to give a complete sequence, or by carrying out a separate full-length PCR using the new sequence information for the design of the 5&prime; primer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may be employed, for example, as research reagents and materials for discovery of treatments of and diagnostics for diseases, particularly human diseases, as further discussed herein relating to polynucleotide assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides of the invention that are oligonucleotides derived from a sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 are useful for the design of PCR primers in reactions to determine whether or not the polynucleotides identified herein in whole or in part are transcribed in bacteria in infected tissue. That is, the polynucleotides of the invention are useful for diagnosis of infection with a bacterial strain carrying those sequences. It is recognized that such sequences also have utility in diagnosis of the stage of infection and type of infection the pathogen has attained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides polynucleotides that encode a polypeptide that is the mature protein plus additional amino or carboxyl-terminal amino acids, or amino acids interior to the mature polypeptide. Such sequences may play a role in processing of a protein from precursor to a mature form, may allow protein transport, may lengthen or shorten protein half-life or may facilitate manipulation of a protein for assay or production, among other things. As generally is the case in vivo, the additional amino acids may be processed away from the mature protein by cellular enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> A precursor protein, having a mature form of the polypeptide fused to one or more prosequences may be an inactive form of the polypeptide. When prosequences are removed such inactive precursors generally are activated. Some or all of the prosequences may be removed before activation. Generally, such precursors are called proproteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide of the invention thus may encode a mature protein, a mature protein plus a leader sequence (which may be referred to as a preprotein), a precursor of a mature protein having one or more prosequences that are not the leader sequences of a preprotein, or a preproprotein, which is a precursor to a proprotein, having a leader sequence and one or more prosequences, which generally are removed during processing steps that produce active and mature forms of the polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In addition to the standard A, G, C, T/U representations for nucleotides, the term &ldquo;N&rdquo; may also be used in describing certain polynucleotides of the invention. &ldquo;N&rdquo; means that any of the four DNA or RNA nucleotides may appear at such a designated position in the DNA or RNA sequence, except it is preferred that N is not a nucleotide that when taken in combination with adjacent nucleotide positions, read in the correct reading frame, would have the effect of generating a premature termination codon in such reading frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> For each and every polynucleotide of the invention there is also provided a polynucleotide complementary to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Vectors, Host Cells, and Expression Systems </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to vectors that comprise a polynucleotide or polynucleotides of the invention, host cells that are genetically engineered with vectors of the invention and the production of polypeptides of the invention by recombinant techniques. Cell-free translation systems can also be employed to produce such proteins using RNAs derived from the DNA constructs of the invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Recombinant STAAU_R9 and bacteriophage polypeptides of the present invention may be prepared by processes well known to those skilled in the art from genetically engineered host cells comprising expression systems. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention relates to expression systems that comprise a STAAU_R9 or bacteriophage polynucleotide or polynucleotides of the present invention, to host cells which are genetically engineered with such expression systems, and to the production of polypeptides of the invention by recombinant techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> For recombinant production of a STAAU_R9 polypeptide of the invention, host cells can be genetically engineered to incorporate expression systems or portions thereof or polynucleotides of the invention. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include bacterial cells (Gram positive and Gram negative), fungal cells, insect cells, animal cells and plant cells. Polynucleotides are introduced to bacteria by standard chemical treatment protocols, such as the induction of competence to take up DNA by treatment with calcium chloride (Sambrook et al., supra). Introduction of polynucleotides into fungal (e.g., yeast) host cells is effected, if desired, by standard chemical methods, such as lithium acetate&mdash;mediated transformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> A great variety of expression systems are useful to produce polypeptides of the invention. Such vectors include among others, chromosomal-, episomal- and virus-derived vectors. For example, vectors derived from bacterial plasmids, from bacteriophages, from transposons, from yeast episomes, from insertion elements, from yeast chromosomal elements, from viruses, and from vectors derived from combinations thereof, are useful in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Polypeptides of the invention are recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid or urea extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and lectin chromatography. Well known techniques for refolding may be employed to regenerate an active conformation when the polypeptide is denatured during isolation and/or purification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Diagnostic, Prognostic, Serotyping, and Mutation Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> This invention is also related to the use of STAAU_R9 polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention for use as diagnostic reagents. Detection of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polynucleotides and/or polypeptides in a eukaryote, particularly a mammal, and especially a human, will provide a diagnostic method for diagnosis of disease, staging of disease or response of an infectious organism to drugs. Eukaryotes, particularly mammals, and especially humans, particularly those infected or suspected to be infected with an organism comprising the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 gene or protein, may be detected at the nucleic acid or amino acid level by a variety of well known techniques as well as by methods provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Polypeptides and polynucleotides for prognosis, diagnosis or other analysis may be obtained from a putatively infected and/or infected individual&apos;s bodily materials. Polynucleotides from any of these sources, particularly DNA or RNA, may be used directly for detection or may be amplified enzymatically by using PCR or any other amplification technique prior to analysis. RNA, particularly mRNA, cDNA and genomic DNA may also be used in the same ways. Using amplification, characterization of the species and strain of infectious or resident organism present in an individual, may be made by an analysis of the genotype of a selected polynucleotide of the organism. Deletions and insertions can be detected by a change in size of the amplified product in comparison to a genotype of a reference sequence selected from a related organism, preferably a different species of the same genus or a different strain of the same species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Point mutations can be identified by hybridizing amplified DNA to labeled STAAU_R9 polynucleotide sequences. Perfectly or significantly matched sequences can be distinguished from imperfectly or more significantly mismatched duplexes by DNase or RNase digestion, for DNA or RNA respectively, or by detecting differences in melting temperatures or renaturation kinetics. Polynucleotide sequence differences may also be detected by alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of polynucleotide fragments in gels as compared to a reference sequence. This may be carried out with or without denaturing agents. Polynucleotide differences may also be detected by direct DNA or RNA sequencing. See, for example, Myers et al, (1985) Science 230, 1242. Sequence changes at specific locations also may be revealed by nuclease protection assays, such as RNase, V1 and S1 protection assay or a chemical cleavage method. See, for example, Cotton et al., (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 85, 4397-4401. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, an array of oligonucleotide probes comprising STAAU_R9 nucleotide sequence or fragments thereof can be constructed to conduct efficient screening of, for example, genetic mutations, serotype, taxonomic classification or identification. Array technology methods are well known and have general applicability and can be used to address a variety of questions in molecular genetics including gene expression, genetic linkage, and genetic variability (see, for example, Chee et al., (1996) Science 274, 610). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Thus in another aspect, the present invention relates to a diagnostic kit which comprises: (a) a polynucleotide of the present invention, preferably the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 5); (b) a nucleotide sequence complementary to that of (a); (c) a polypeptide of the present invention, preferably the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6); or (d) an antibody to a polypeptide of the present invention, preferably to the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that in any such kit, (a), (b), (c) or (d) may comprise a substantial component. Such a kit will be of use in diagnosing a disease or susceptibility to a disease, among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> This invention also relates to the use of STAAU_R9 polynucleotides of the present invention as diagnostic reagents. Detection of a mutated form of a polynucleotide of the invention, preferably, SEQ ID NO: 1, which is associated with a disease or pathogenicity will provide a diagnostic tool that can add to, or define, a diagnosis of a disease, a prognosis of a course of disease, a determination of a stage of disease, or a susceptibility to a disease, which results from under-expression, over-expression or altered expression of the polynucleotide. Organisms, particularly infectious organisms, carrying mutations in such polynucleotide may be detected at the polynucleotide level by a variety of techniques, such as those described elsewhere herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> The STAAU_R9 nucleotide sequences of the present invention are also valuable for organism chromosome identification. The sequence is specifically targeted to, and can hybridize with, a particular location on an organism&apos;s chromosome, particularly to a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>chromosome. The mapping of relevant sequences to chromosomes according to the present invention may be an important step in correlating those sequences with pathogenic potential and/or an ecological niche of an organism and/or drug resistance of an organism, as well as the essentiality of the gene to the organism. Once a sequence has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location, the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. Such data may be found on-line in a sequence database. The relationship between genes and diseases that have been mapped to the same chromosomal region are then identified through known genetic methods, for example, through linkage analysis (coinheritance of physically adjacent genes) or mating studies, such as by conjugation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The differences in a polynucleotide and/or polypeptide sequence between organisms possessing a first phenotype and organisms possessing a different, second different phenotype can also be determined. If a mutation is observed in some or all organisms possessing the first phenotype but not in any organisms possessing the second phenotype, then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of the first phenotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Polypeptides and polynucleotides for prognosis, diagnosis or other analysis may be obtained from a putatively infected and/or infected individual&apos;s bodily materials. Particularly DNA or polynucleotides, from any of these sources may be used directly for detection or may be amplified enzymatically using PCR or other amplification technique with oligonucleotide amplification primers derived from the polynucleotide sequence of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9. RNA, particularly mRNA, or RNA reverse transcribed to cDNA, is also useful for diagnostics. Following amplification of a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9related polynucleotide from a sample, characterization of the species and strain of infecting or resident organism is made by an analysis of the amplified polynucleotide relative to one or more reference polynucleotides or sequences relative to a standard from a related organism (i.e. a known strain of <highlight><italic>S. aureus</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a process for diagnosing bacterial infections such as those caused by <highlight><italic>S. aureus, </italic></highlight>the process comprising determining from a sample derived from an individual, such as a bodily material, an increased level of expression of a polynucleotide having a sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1 relative to a sample taken from a non-diseased individual. Increased or decreased expression of a STAAU_R9 polynucleotide can be measured using any one of the methods well known in the art for the quantitation of polynucleotides, such as, for example, PCR, RT-PCR, RNase protection, Northern blotting and other hybridization methods, and spectrometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> In addition, a diagnostic assay in accordance with the invention for detecting over-expression of STAAU_R9 polypeptide compared to normal control tissue samples may be used to detect the presence of an infection, for example. Assay techniques that can be used to determine levels of a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, in a sample derived from a host, such as a bodily material, are well-known to those of skill in the art. Such assay methods include radioimmunoassays, competitive-binding assays, Western Blot analysis, antibody sandwich assays, antibody detection and ELISA assays. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> The STMU_R9 polynucleotides of the invention may be used as components of polynucleotide arrays, preferably high density arrays or grids. These high density arrays are particularly useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. For example, a set of spots each comprising a different gene, and further comprising a polynucleotide or polynucleotides of the invention, may be used for probing, such as hybridization or nucleic acid amplification, using a probe obtained or derived from a bodily sample, to determine the presence a particular polynucleotide sequence or related sequence in an individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Antibodies Specific for <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>Peptides or Polypeptides </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> The STAAU_R9 polypeptides and polynucleotides of the invention or variants thereof, or cells expressing them are useful as immunogens to produce antibodies immunospecific for such polypeptides or polynucleotides, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In certain preferred embodiments of the invention there are provided antibodies against <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptides or polynucleotides encoding them. Antibodies against STAAU_R9-polypeptide or STAAU_R9-polynucleotide are useful for treatment of infections, particularly bacterial infections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Antibodies generated against the polypeptides or polynucleotides of the invention are obtained by administering the polypeptides and/or polynucleotides of the invention or epitope-bearing fragments of either or both, analogues of either or both, or cells expressing either or both, to an animal, preferably a nonhuman, using routine protocols. For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, any technique known in the art that provides antibodies produced by continuous cell line cultures is useful. Examples include various techniques, such as those in Kohler, G. and Milstein, C., Nature 256: 495-497 (1975); Kozbor et al., Immunology Today 4: 72 (1983); and Cole et al., pg. 96-96 in Monoclonal Anbitodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc. (1985). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,968) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies to polypeptides or polynucleotides of this invention. Also, transgenic mice, or other mammals, are useful to express humanized antibodies immunospecific to the polypeptides or polynucleotides of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> When antibodies are administered therapeutically, the antibody or variant thereof is preferably modified to make it less immunogenic in the individual. For example, if the individual is human the antibody is most preferably &ldquo;humanized,&rdquo; where the complementarity determining region or regions of the hybridoma-derived antibody has been transplanted into a human monoclonal antibody, for example as described in Jones et al. (1986), Nature 321, 522-525 or Tempest et al., (1991) Biotechnology 9, 266-273. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, phage display technology is useful to select antibody genes with binding activities towards a STMU_R9 polypeptide of the invention. In one possible scheme, antibody fragments specific for <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 are selected from an immune library of antibody genes expressed as fusions with coat protein of filamentous phage. Alternatively, naive libraries are screened by phage display techniques to identify genes encoding antibodies specified for STAAU_R9 or from naive libraries &lsqb;McCafferty, et al., (1990), Nature 348, 552-554; Marks, et al., (1992) Biotechnology 10, 969-783; a recent reference is de Haard et al. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274: 18218-18230&rsqb;. The ability to recover, for various targets, antibodies with subnanomolar affinities obviates the need for immunization. The affinity of these antibodies can also be improved by, for example, chain shuffling &lsqb;Clackson et al., (1991) Nature 352: 628&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> The above-described antibodies may be employed to isolate or to identify clones expressing the polypeptides or polynucleotides of the invention, for example to purify the polypeptides or polynucleotides by immunoaffinity chromatography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> A variant polypeptide or polynucleotide of the invention, such as an antigenically or immunologically equivalent derivative or a fusion protein of the polypeptide is also useful as an antigen to immunize a mouse or other animal such as a rat or chicken. A fused protein provides stability to the polypeptide acting as a carrier, or acts as an adjuvant or both. Alternatively, the antigen is associated, for example by conjugation, with an immunogenic carrier protein, such as bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet haemocyanin or tetanus toxoid. Alternatively, when antibodies are to be administered therapeutically, alternatively a multiple antigenic polypeptide comprising multiple copies of the polypeptide, or an antigenically or immunologically equivalent polypeptide thereof may be sufficiently antigenic to improve immunogenicity so as to obviate the use of a carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a STAAU_R9 polynucleotide of the invention for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes, in particular genetic immunization. The use of a STAAU_R9 polynucleotide of the invention in genetic immunization preferably employs a suitable delivery method such as direct injection of plasmid DNA into muscles &lsqb;Wolff et al., Hum Mol Genet (1992) 1: 363, Manthorpe et al., Hum. Gene Ther. (1983) 4: 419&rsqb;, delivery of DNA complexed with specific protein carriers &lsqb;Wu et at., JBiol Chem.

<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> The invention is based in part on the discovery that STAAU_R9 is a target for the bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 inhibitory factor. The inventors have recognized the utility of the interaction in the development of antibacterial agents. Specifically, the inventors have recognized that 1) STAAU_R9 is a critical target for bacterial inhibition; 2) 96 ORF 78 or derivatives or functional mimetics thereof are useful for inhibiting bacterial growth; and 3) the interaction between STAAU_R9 or fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6) of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>and 96 ORF 78 may be used as a target for the screening and rational design of drugs or antibacterial agents. In addition to methods of directly inhibiting STAAU_R9 activity, methods of inhibiting STAAU_R9 expression are also attractive for antibacterial activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> In several embodiments of the invention, there are provided methods for identifying compounds which bind to or otherwise interact with and inhibit or activate an activity or expression of a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide of the invention comprising: contacting a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide of the invention with a compound to be screened under conditions to permit binding to or other interaction between the compound and the polypeptide and/or polynucleotide to assess the binding to or other interaction with the compound, such binding or interaction preferably being associated with a second component capable of providing a detectable signal in response to the binding or interaction of the polypeptide and/or polynucleotide with the compound; and determining whether the compound binds to or otherwise interacts with and activates or inhibits an activity or expression of the polypeptide and/or polynucleotide by detecting the presence or absence of a signal generated from the binding or interaction of the compound with the polypeptide and/or polynucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Potential antagonists include, among others, small organic molecules, peptides, polypeptides and antibodies that bind to a polynucleotide and/or polypeptide of the invention and thereby inhibit or extinguish its activity or expression. Potential antagonists also may be small organic molecules, a peptide, a polypeptide such as a closely related protein or antibody that binds the same sites on a binding molecule, such as a binding molecule, without inducing STAAU_R9-induced activities, thereby preventing the action or expression of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptides and/or polynucleotides by excluding <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptides and/or polynucleotides from binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Potential antagonists also include a small molecule that binds to and occupies the binding site of the polypeptide thereby preventing binding to cellular binding molecules, such that normal biological activity is prevented. Cellular binding molecules include but are not limited to proteins involved in DNA replication. Examples of cellular binding molecules include DNA helicase, DNA Pol III, and SSB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small organic molecules, peptides or peptide-like molecules. Other potential antagonists include antisense molecules &lsqb;see Okano, (1991) J. Neurochem. 56, 560; see also Oligodeoxynucleotides As Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988), for a description of these molecules&rsqb;. Preferred potential antagonists include compounds related to and variants of 96 ORF 78 and of STAAU_R9. Other examples of potential polypeptide antagonists include antibodies or, in some cases, oligonucleotides or proteins which are closely related to the ligands, substrates, receptors, enzymes, etc., as the case may be, of the polypeptide, e.g., a fragment of the ligands, substrates, receptors, enzymes, etc.; or small molecules which bind to the polypeptide of the present invention but do not elicit a response, so that the activity of the polypeptide is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> Compounds may be identified from a variety of sources, for example, cells, cell-free preparations, chemical libraries, and natural product mixtures. These substrates and ligands may be natural substrates and ligands or may be structural or functional mimetics. See, e.g., Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology 1(2): Chapter 5 (1991). Peptide modulators can also be selected by screening large random libraries of all possible peptides of a certain length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> Compounds derived from the polypeptide sequence of 96 ORF 78 could represent fragments representing small overlapping peptides spanning the entire amino acid sequence of these ORFs. Fragments of 96 ORF 78 can be produced as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Certain of the polypeptides of the invention are biomimetics, functional mimetics of the natural <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide. These functional mimetics are useful for, among other things, antagonizing the activity of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide or as an antigen or immunogen in a manner described above. Functional mimetics of the polypeptides of the invention include but are not limited to truncated polypeptides. For example, preferred functional mimetics include a polypeptide comprising the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6 lacking 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25amino- or carboxy-terminal amino acid residues, including fusion proteins comprising one or more of these truncated sequences. Polynucleotides encoding each of these functional mimetics may be used as expression cassettes to express each mimetic polypeptide. It is preferred that these cassettes comprise 5&prime; and 3&prime; restriction sites to allow for a convenient means to ligate the cassettes together when desired. It is further preferred that these cassettes comprise gene expression signals known in the art or described elsewhere herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Screening Assays According to the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to devise screening methods to identify compounds which stimulate or which inhibit the function of the STAAU_R9 polypeptide or polynucleotide of the invention. Accordingly, the present invention provides for a method of screening compounds to identify those that modulate the function of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the invention. In general, antagonists may be employed for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. It is contemplated that an agonist of STAAU_R9 may be useful, for example, to enhance the growth rate of bacteria in a sample being cultured for diagnostic or other purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> It has been determined that STAAU_R9 is a target for bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 product, which acts as an inhibitory factor. Applicants have recognized the utility of the interaction in the development of antibacterial agents. Polypeptide and/or polynucleotide targets such as STAAU_R9 are critical targets for bacterial inhibition. <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 or derivatives or functional mimetics thereof are useful for inhibiting bacterial growth and the interaction, binding, inhibition and/or activation which occurs between polypeptides, such as for example STMU_R9 of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>and 96 ORF 78 may be used for the screening and rational design of drugs or antibacterial agents. In addition to methods for directly inhibiting a target such as STAAU_R9 activity, methods of inhibiting a target such as STAAU_R9 expression are also attractive for antibacterial activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, the method involves the interaction of an inhibitory ORF product or fragment thereof with the corresponding bacterial target or fragment thereof that maintains the interaction with the ORF product or fragment. Interference with the interaction between the components can be monitored, and such interference is indicative of compounds that may inhibit, activate, or enhance the activity of the target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> a. Binding Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> There are a number of methods of examining binding of a candidate compound to a protein target such as STAAU_R9 and a polypeptide comprising amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or fragment thereof such as SEQ ID NO: 6. Screening methods that measure the binding of a candidate compound to a STAAU_R9 polypeptide or polynucleotide, or to cells or supports bearing the polypeptide or a fusion protein comprising the polypeptide, by means of a label directly or indirectly associated with the candidate compound, are useful in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The screening method may involve competition for binding of a labeled competitor such as 96 ORF 78 or a fragment that is competent to bind STAAU_R9 or fragment thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Non-limiting examples of screening assays suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include the following &lsqb;Reviewed in Sittampalam et al. 1997 Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 3:384-91&rsqb;: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> i.) Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> A method of measuring inhibition of binding of two proteins using fluorescence resonance energy transfer &lsqb;FRET; de Angelis, 1999, Physiological Genomics&rsqb;. FRET is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs between a fluorescence donor (D) and a fluorescence acceptor (A) in close proximity (usually &lt;100 A of separation.) if the emission spectrum of D overlaps with the excitation spectrum of A. Variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish <highlight><italic>Aequorea victoria </italic></highlight>are fused to a polypeptide or protein and serve as D-A pairs in a FRET scheme to measure protein-protein interaction. Cyan (CFP: D) and yellow (YFP: A) fluorescence proteins are linked with STAAU_R9 polypeptide, or a fragment thereof and a 96 ORF 78 polypeptide respectively. Under optimal proximity, interaction between the STAAU_R9 polypeptide and a 96 ORF 78 polypeptide causes a decrease in intensity of CFP fluorescence concomitant with an increase in YFP fluorescence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> The addition of a candidate modulator to the mixture of appropriately labeled STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78 polypeptide, will result in an inhibition of energy transfer evidenced by, for example, a decrease in YFP fluorescence at a given concentration of 96 ORF 78 relative to a sample without the candidate inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> An extension of the FRET technology, termed time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET or HTRF &lsqb;homogeneous time-resolved energy transfer&rsqb;) lends itself particularly well to identification of protein-protein interactions in the context of high-throughput screening. In brief, TR-FRET constitutes a homogeneous assay method based on the long-lived fluorescence of rare earth cryptates such as Europium (Eu) and amplification by nonradiative energy transfer to a suitable acceptor such as allophycocyanin (APC). The TR-FRET principle allows double discrimination of the emitted signal through temporal and spectral selectivity. Since the lifetime of fluorescence emission from APC (acceptor) contains a contribution equal to the Eu (donor) lifetime in the presence of nonradiative energy transfer, a long-lived APC acceptor signal can be resolved from its natural prompt fluorescence in the absence of energy transfer. Eu and APC are brought into proximity via a pair of interacting molecules such as polypeptides. To demonstrate interaction between the STAAU_R9 polypeptide, or a fragment thereof, and a 96 ORF 78 polypeptide, the respective polypeptide is labeled by recombinant DNA methodology to contain an N- or C-terminal tag that is recognized by a binding molecule which itself is conjugated to either Eu or APC. A variety of binding molecules may be employed, including an antibody (directed against an epitope) or streptavidin (directed against biotin). Alternatively, one or both of the interacting proteins is conjugated directly to either Eu or APC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> In one of several possible assay formats, STAAU_R9, or a fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6) is expressed as a fusion with a polyhistidine tag and is recognized by an anti-polyhistidine Eu antibody conjugate; 96 ORF 78 is expressed as a fusion with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and is detected by an anti-GST APC antibody conjugate. Under optimal proximity and in the presence of the anti-polyhistidine and anti-GST antibody conjugates, interaction between STAAU_R9, or a fragment thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6), and 96 ORF 78 induces nonradiative, time-resolved energy transfer from Eu to APC, detected optimally at 665 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> The addition of a candidate modulator (i.e., a test compound) to the mixture of appropriately labeled STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78 polypeptide, will result in an inhibition of energy transfer evidenced by, for example, a decrease in APC fluorescence at a given concentration of 96 ORF 78 relative to a sample without the candidate inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> ii.) Fluorescence Polarization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Fluorescence polarization measurement is another useful method to quantitate protein-protein binding. The fluorescence polarization value for a fluorescently-tagged molecule depends on the rotational correlation time or tumbling rate. Protein complexes, such as those formed by a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, or a fragment thereof associating with a fluorescently labeled polypeptide (e.g., 96 ORF 78 or a binding fragment thereof), have higher polarization values than does the fluorescently labeled polypeptide. Inclusion of a candidate inhibitor of the STAAU_R9 interaction results in a decrease in fluorescence polarization relative to a mixture without the candidate inhibitor if the candidate inhibitor disrupts or inhibits the interaction of STAAU_R9 with its polypeptide binding partner. It is preferred that this method be used to characterize small molecules that disrupt the formation of polypeptide or protein complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> iii.) Surface Plasmon Resonance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Another powerful assay to screen for inhibitors of a protein: protein interaction is surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance is a quantitative method that measures binding between two (or more) molecules by the change in mass near a sensor surface caused by the binding of one protein or other biomolecule from the aqueous phase (analyte) to a second protein or biomolecule immobilized on the sensor(ligand). This change in mass is measured as resonance units versus time after injection or removal of the second protein or biomolecule (analyte) and is measured using a Biacore Biosensor (Biacore AB) or similar device. STAAU_R9, or a polypeptide comprising a fragment of STAAU_R9 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6), could be immobilized as a ligand on a sensor chip (for example, research grade CM5 chip; Biacore AB) using a covalent linkage method (e.g. amine coupling in 10 mM sodium acetate &lsqb;pH 4.5&rsqb;). A blank surface is prepared by activating and inactivating a sensor chip without protein immobilization. Alternatively, a ligand surface can be prepared by noncovalent capture of ligand on the surface of the sensor chip by means of a peptide affinity tag, an antibody, or biotinylation. The binding of 96 ORF 78 to STAAU_R9, or a fragment thereof, is measured by injecting purified 96 ORF 78 over the ligand chip surface. Measurements are performed at any desired temperature between 4&deg; C. and 37&deg; C. Conditions used for the assay (i.e., those permitting binding) are as follows: 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mM sodium chloride, 15% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.001% Tween 20 with a flow rate of 10 ul/min. Preincubation of the sensor chip with candidate inhibitors will predictably decrease the interaction between 96 ORF 78 and STAAU_R9. A decrease in 96 ORF 78 binding, detected as a reduced response on sensorgrams and measured in resonance units, is indicative of competitive binding by the candidate compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> iv.) Scintillation Proximity Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> A scintillation proximity assay (SPA) may be used to characterize the interaction between a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, or a fragment thereof, for example comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or SEQ ID NO: 6, and another polypeptide. The SPA relies in a solid-phase substrate, such as beads or the plastic of a microtitre plate, into which a scintillant has been incorporated. For the assay, the target protein, for example a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide, is coupled to the beads or to the surface of the plate, either covalently through activated surface chemistries or non-covalently through a peptide affinity tag, an antibody, or biotinylation. Addition of a radiolabeled binding polypeptide, for example &lsqb;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;-radiolabeled 96 ORF 78, results in close proximity of the radioactive source molecule to the scintillant. As a consequence, the radioactive decay excites the scintillant contained within the bead or within the plastic of the plate and detectable light is emitted. Compounds that prevent the association between immobilized <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide and radiolabeled 96 ORF 78 will diminish the scintillation signal. The SPA thus represents an example of an ideal technology with which to screen for inhibitors of the STAAU_R9-96 ORF 78 interactions because it is readily adapted to high-throughput, automated format and because of its sensitivity for detection of protein-protein interactions with K<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>values in the micromolar to nanomolar ranges. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> ICS biosensors have been described by AMBRI (Australian Membrane Biotechnology Research Institute; http//www.ambri.com.au/). In this technology, the self-association of macromolecules such as STAAU_R9, or fragment thereof, and bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 or fragment thereof, is coupled to the closing of gramacidin-facilitated ion channels in suspended membrane bilayers and hence to a measurable change in the admittance (similar to impedence) of the biosensor. This approach is linear over six order of magnitude of admittance change and is ideally suited for large scale, high through-put screening of small molecule combinatorial libraries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> vi.) Phage Display </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Phage display is a powerful assay to measure protein:protein interaction. In this scheme, proteins or peptides are expressed as fusions with coat proteins or tail proteins of filamentous bacteriophage. A comprehensive monograph on this subject is <highlight><italic>Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins. A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>edited by Kay et al. (1996) Academic Press. For phages in the Ff family that include M13 and fd, gene III protein and gene VIII protein are the most commonly-used partners for fusion with foreign protein or peptides. Phagemids are vectors containing origins of replication both for plasmids and for bacteriophage. Phagemids encoding fusions to the gene III or gene VIII can be rescued from their bacterial hosts with helper phage, resulting in the display of the foreign sequences on the coat or at the tip of the recombinant phage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> In one example of a simple assay, purified recombinant STAAU_R9 protein, or fragment thereof, could be immobilized in the wells of a microtitre plate and incubated with phages displaying a 96 ORF 78 sequence in fusion with the gene III protein. Washing steps are performed to remove unbound phages and bound phages are detected with monoclonal antibodies directed against phage coat protein (gene VIII protein). An enzyme-linked secondary antibody allows quantitative detection of bound fusion protein by fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or colourimetric conversion. Screening for inhibitors is performed by the incubation of the compound with the immobilized target before the addition of phages. The presence of an inhibitor will specifically reduce the signal in a dose-dependent manner relative to controls without inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> It is important to note that in assays of protein-protein interaction, it is possible that a modulator of the interaction need not necessarily interact directly with the domain(s) of the proteins that physically interact. It is also possible that a modulator will interact at a location removed from the site of protein-protein interaction and cause, for example, a conformational change in the STAAU_R9 polypeptide. Modulators (inhibitors or agonists) that act in this manner can be termed allosteric effectors and are of interest since the change they induce may modify the activity of the STAAU_R9 polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> Testing for inhibitors is performed by the incubation of the compound with the reaction mixtures. The presence of an inhibitor will specifically reduce the signal in a dose-dependent manner relative to controls without inhibitor. Compounds selected for their ability to inhibit interactions between STAAU_R9-96 ORF 78 is further tested in functional activity assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> b. Assays of STAAU_R9 Functional Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> Non-limiting examples of assays to assess the functional enzymatic activity of STAAU_R9, or fragments thereof (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 6), variant or homolog thereof, include the measurement of stimulation of DNA replication. There are a number of well-known methods of measuring the DNA synthesis stimulation of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of STAAU_R9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> In vivo assay for DNA Replication, Plasmid Replication </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> One example of an assay for STAAU_R9 activity could involved the measurement of radiolabeled nucleotide incorporated into cellular DNA. Samples (0.5 ml) are withdrawn from cultures at appropriate time intervals and mixed with 4.5 &mgr;l of labeling solution (0.2 &mgr;Ci/ml of <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-thymidine &lsqb;73 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Inc.&rsqb; and 70 pmol of unlabeled thymidine). After 15 minutes of reaction, incorporation is stopped by adding 5 &mgr;l of 0.2% NaN<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and 5 &mgr;l of 30 &mgr;g/ml unlabeled thymidine. Samples are precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and filtered through glass fiber filters (GF-C, Whatman). The results are expressed as <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-thymidine counts incorporated, normalized to the OD of the culture. Cultures of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>are grown in the presence of varying concentrations of a candidate compound added directly to the medium. For compounds that correspond to polypeptides, the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptides can be cloned into a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>expression vector containing an inducible promotor. The expression of the polypeptide can be induced following transfection of cells. In one assay, a plasmid containing a candidate inhibitor polypeptide (e.g. 96 ORF 78 or fragment or variant thereof) coding sequence under an inducible promotor is introduced into a <highlight><italic>S aureus. </italic></highlight>At least a 10-fold reduction in <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-thymidine incorporation in the presence of 96 ORF 78 or other inhibitor indicates a reduction in STAAU_R9 activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> The plasmid pC194 replicates in <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>by rolling circle mechanism. The single stranded origin, sso of the pC194 is involved in the synthesis of the lagging DNA strand. The plasmid pADG6406 is a derivative of pC194 lacking sso. The absence of sso leads the accumulation of plasmid single-stranded DNA. The single-stranded (ss) initiation site, ssiA, is located on the lagging strand of pAM&bgr;1 and is a site for primosome assembly. ssiA was inserted into plasmid pADG6404. <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>harboring plasmids are grown to mid-log phase and their total DNA is extracted and analyzed by Southern hybridization, using <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled plasmid DNA as probe. The presence of pADG6406 with ssiA is associated with a decrease in the ratio of ss- to ds DNA compared to that of the plasmid without ssiA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> This system is used to measure the effect of a candidate inhibitor, for example, 96 ORF 78 on DNA synthesis. Cultures of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>are grown in the presence of varying concentrations of a candidate compound added directly to the medium. For compounds that correspond to polypeptides, the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptides can be cloned into a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>expression vector containing an inducible promotor. The expression of the polypeptide can be induced following transfection of cells. In one assay, a plasmid containing a candidate inhibitor polypeptide coding sequence under an inducible promotor is introduced into a <highlight><italic>S aureus </italic></highlight>strain harboring pADG6406. The ratio of ss to ds DNA of pADG6406 is measured in the presence or in the absence of sodium arsenite (5 uM). An increase in the ratio of ss to ds DNA (10% or more) indicates an effect of the candidate modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> In vitro DNA Replication Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> In one cell-free in vitro assay, an extract prepared from <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>is supplied to a plasmid substrate, for example a circular M13ssDNA substrate, in a reaction including exogenous radiolabeled deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dATP, dTTP, dGTP and dCTP), MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and ATP. The reaction is stopped and the products precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and then filtered. Scintillation counting of the dried filter gives the level of de novo DNA replication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> Another example of assay for STAAU_R9 activity is to measure the level of radiolabeled nucleotide incorporated into DNA in a reconstituted in vitro assay using ssDNA substrate &lsqb;Yuhakov et al. 1999, Cell 96: 153-163&rsqb;. The replication reactions typically contained Tris-HCl &lsqb;pH 7.5&rsqb;, MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, BSA, DTT, ATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dATP, &lsqb;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;dTTP, EDTA, glycerol, ssDNA, purified <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>SSB, DNA polymerase holoenzyme and an increasing amount of STAAU_R9 polypeptide. Reactions were incubated at 37&deg; C. for 5 min and quenched by addition of SDS and EDTA at different time points. The reaction products are precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and then filtered. Scintillation counting of the dried filter gives the level of de novo replication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a rapid fluorometric assay that measures the activity of replication enzymes can be developed to measure STAAU_R9 activity. The fluorometric assay is based on the preferential binding of a fluorescent dye to double stranded DNA, for example, de novo synthesized DNA, vs. single stranded DNA &lsqb;Seville et al., 1996. Biotechniques 21: 664-672&rsqb;. A reconstituted in vitro assay similar to that described above can also be developed. Reactions are incubated at 37&deg; C. for variable times then quenched. The quenched reaction is analyzed for total DNA synthesis by adding PicoGreen dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), incubating 5 min at room temperature, and reading the intensity of fluorescence of PicoGreen (&lgr;<highlight><subscript>Ex</subscript></highlight>, 485 nm; &lgr;<highlight><subscript>EM</subscript></highlight>, 525 nm). The sensitivity of the dye and the homogeneous nature of the PicoGreen assay should allow rapid screening in a non-radiometric assay format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> Testing for inhibitors, for example 96 ORF 78, is performed by incubating the compound with the reaction mixtures. The presence of an inhibitor will specifically reduce the signal in a dose-dependent manner relative to controls without inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Assay for RNA Primase Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> To measure the DnaG activity, the level of primase activity can be measured in an in vitro assay &lsqb;Sivaraja et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,038&rsqb;. In the assay, DnaG polymerizes ribonucleotide triphosphates on a template to form a nucleic acid comprising one or more DNA-RNA heterohybrid regions. The presence of the resulting DNA-RNA heterohybrid regions is quantitated either by contacting the nucleic acid with a detection reagent which binds specifically to the DNA-RNA heterohybrid regions, such as an antibody that specifically recognizes the indicated molecule, or by the incorporation into the reaction mixture of a ribonucleotide triphosphate that comprises a label, such as biotin or digoxygenin, which is detected by a reagent that binds specifically to the label. The label is a composition that is detectable, either directly or indirectly, by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means. Useful labels include fluorescent dyes, enzymes and their substrates, biotin-streptavidin, digoxygenin, or haptens and proteins for which antibodies are available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> Samples or assays that are treated with a potential inhibitor are compared to control samples without the test compound to examine the extent of inhibition of primase activity, namely the synthesis of an RNA oligonucleotide on a DNA template. Control samples (untreated with test inhibitors) are assigned a relative primase activity value of 100; inhibition of STAAU_R9 activity is achieved when the primase activity value of the test sample relative to the control is about 75, more preferably 50, most preferably 25. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> Assay for Helicase Unwinding Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> The DnaG primase and DnaB helicase proteins of both the Gram-negative bacterium <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>&lsqb;Lu, Y., et al., &rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., </italic></highlight>93:12902-12907, (1996)&rsqb; and the Gram-positive bacterium <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus </italic></highlight>&lsqb;Bird, L. E., et al., 39:171-182, Biochem.(2000)&rsqb; are known to associate to form protein-protein complexes. The formation of the primase-helicase complex has important functional consequences. While DnaG primase has no measurable helicase activity, it stimulates the helicase activity of DnaB helicase when added to helicase assays containing DnaB. As for <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus, </italic></highlight>it is possible that the helicase activity of DnaC from <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>is similarly stimulated by interaction with <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>DnaG primase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> Helicases use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to unwind duplex DNA at a replication fork. In the assay for helicase activity, a DNA substrate for the helicase reactions is prepared by labeling an oligonucleotide of between 50-100 nucleotides at the 5&prime;-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of radiolabeled nucleotides. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide is annealed to single-stranded M13 mp18 DNA (7.2 kb), resulting in a radiolabeled DNA duplex substrate with both 5&prime;- and 3&prime;-tails. The addition of increasing amounts of DnaG primase to DnaC helicase predictably results in the melting of the DNA duplex such that the radiolabel is separated from the M13mp18 DNA. Resolution of the reaction mixture on nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels results in the migration of the labeled oligonucleotide away from remaining duplex DNA, which migrates to a position corresponding to the lower relative mobility, owing to the significantly higher relative molecular mass, of the duplex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> The helicase activity screen is performed in the presence of increasing amounts of inhibitors, for example, 96 ORF 78, to establish the ability of the candidate inhibitor to inhibit the helicase-stimulating activity of DnaG primase. The lack of an increase in electrophoretic mobility of the labeled oligonucleotide in the presence of the candidate compound indicates that the compound has affected the ability of DnaG primase to stimulate the helicase activity of DnaC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> Assay for Helicase ATPase Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> The unwinding activity of helicase is dependent upon the presence of ATP. However, in the absence of a DNA duplex substrate, helicase demonstrates ATPase activity. The presence of DnaG primase stimulates both the helicase activity and the ATPase activity of DnaB helicase in <highlight><italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus </italic></highlight>&lsqb;Bird, L. E., et al. (2000), Biochem., 39:171-182&rsqb;. The ability of DnaG primase to stimulate the ATPase activity of helicase is determined in an ATPase assay in which ATP hydrolysis is measured under steady-state conditions. In the assay, ATP hydrolysis is linked to the oxidation of NADH, which provides for a convenient spectrophotometric determination of ATPase activity. The ATPase activity profile, measured as rate of ATP hydrolysis vs. ATP concentration, changes markedly in assays including DnaG primase, attaining a 4- to 5-fold higher rate of ATPase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> The influence of an inhibitor, exemplified by 96 ORF 78, upon the ability of primase to stimulate the ATPase activity is measured in the ATP assay as described with the inclusion of increasing concentrations of inhibitors in the reaction mixture. A decrease in the ATPase activity of helicase, measured as a decrease in the oxidation of NADH or as a decrease in the absorbance at 630 nm in the malachite green Pi release assay, in the presence of both primase and a candidate compound indicates that the compound has affected the ability of DnaG primase to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaC helicase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> c. Bacterial Growth Inhibition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Compounds selected for their ability to inhibit interactions between a STAAU_R9 polypeptide and 96 ORF 78 polypeptide or to inhibit the STAAU_R9 activity can be further tested in functional assays of bacterial growth. Cultures of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>are grown in the presence of varying concentrations of a candidate compound added directly to the medium or using a vehicle which is appropriate for the delivery of the compound into the cell. For compounds that correspond to polypeptides, the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptides can be cloned into a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>expression vector containing an inducible promotor. The expression of the polypeptide could be induced following transfection of cells. For example, the polypeptide may include, but is not limited to different 96 ORF 78-derived fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> Following the induction of expression or the addition of compound, the cultures are then incubated for an additional 4 h at 37&deg; C. During that period of time, the effect of inhibitors on bacterial cell growth may be monitored at 40 min intervals, by measuring, for example, the OD<highlight><subscript>565 </subscript></highlight>and the number of colony forming units (CFU) in the cultures. The number of CFU is evaluated as follows: cultures are serially diluted and aliquots from the different cultures are plated out on agar plates. Following incubation overnight at 37&deg; C., the number of colonies is counted. Non-treated cultures of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>are included as negative control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention relates to a screening kit for identifying agonists, antagonists, ligands, receptors, substrates, enzymes, etc. for a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide of the present invention; or compounds which decrease or enhance the production of such polypeptides and/or polynucleotides, which comprises: (a) a polypeptide and/or a polynucleotide of the present invention; (b) a recombinant cell expressing a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide of the present invention; (c) a cell membrane associated with a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide of the present invention; or (d) an antibody to a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide of the present invention; which polypeptide is preferably that of SEQ ID NO: 2, and for which the polynucleotide is preferably that of SEQ ID NO: 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that in any such kit, (a), (b), (c) or (d) may comprise a substantial component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> It will be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan that a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide of the present invention may also be used in a method for the structure-based design of an agonist, antagonist or inhibitor of the polypeptide and/or polynucleotide, by: (a) determining in the first instance the three-dimensional structure of the polypeptide and/or polynucleotide, or complexes thereof; (b) deducing the three-dimensional structure for the likely reactive site(s), binding site(s) or motif(s) of an agonist, antagonist or inhibitor; (c) synthesizing candidate compounds that are predicted to bind to or react with the deduced binding site(s), reactive site(s), and/or motif(s); and (d) testing whether the candidate compounds are indeed agonists, antagonists or inhibitors. It will be further appreciated that this will normally be an iterative process, and this iterative process may be performed using automated and computer-controlled steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> Each of the polynucleotide sequences provided herein may be used in the discovery and development of antibacterial compounds. The encoded protein, upon expression, can be used as a target for the screening of antibacterial drugs. Additionally, the polynucleotide sequences encoding the amino terminal regions of the encoded protein or Shine-Dalgarno or other sequence that facilitate translation of the respective mRNA can be used to construct antisense sequences to control the expression of the coding sequence of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides the use of the polypeptide, polynucleotide, agonist or antagonist of the invention to interfere with the initial physical interaction between a pathogen or pathogens and a eukaryotic, preferably mammalian, host that is responsible for sequelae of infection. In particular, the molecules of the invention may be used: in the prevention of adhesion of bacteria, in particular Gram positive and/or Gram negative bacteria, to eukaryotic, preferably mammalian, extracellular matrix proteins on in-dwelling devices or to extracellular matrix proteins in wounds; to block bacterial adhesion between eukaryotic, preferably mammalian, extracellular matrix proteins and bacterial STAAU_R9 proteins that mediate tissue damage and/or; to block the normal progression of pathogenesis in infections initiated other than by the implantation of in-dwelling devices or by other surgical techniques. In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there are provided STAAU_R9 antagonists, preferably bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal antagonists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> The antagonists of the invention may be employed, for instance, to prevent, inhibit and/or treat diseases. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the invention there are provided compositions comprising a STAAU_R9 polynucleotide and/or a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 polypeptide for administration to a cell or to a multicellular organism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide, such as the soluble form of a polypeptide and/or polynucleotide of the present invention, antagonist peptide or small molecule compound, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in any effective, convenient manner including, for instance, administration by topical, oral, anal, vaginal, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal or intradermal routes among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> In therapy or as a prophylactic, the active agent may be administered to an individual as an injectable composition, for example as a sterile aqueous dispersion, preferably isotonic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> Alternatively the composition may be formulated for topical application for example in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, eye ointments, eye drops, ear drops, mouthwash, impregnated dressings and sutures and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives, including, for example, preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration, and emollients in ointments and creams. Such topical formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, for example cream or ointment bases, and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Such carriers may constitute from about 1% to about 98% by weight of the formulation; more usually they will constitute up to about 80% by weight of the formulation. Alternative means for systemic administration include transmucosal and transdermal administration using penetrants such as bile salts or fusidic acids or other detergents. In addition, if a polypeptide or other compounds of the present invention can be formulated in an enteric or an encapsulated formulation, oral administration may also be possible. Administration of these compounds may also be topical and/or localized, in the form of salves, pastes, gels, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> For administration to mammals, and particularly humans, it is expected that the daily dosage level of the active agent will be from 0.01 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, typically around 1 mg/kg. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage that will be most suitable for an individual and will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular individual. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;in-dwelling device&rdquo; refers to surgical implants, prosthetic devices and catheters, i.e., devices that are introduced to the body of an individual and remain in position for an extended time. Such devices include, but are not limited to, artificial joints, heart valves, pacemakers, vascular grafts, vascular catheters, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, urinary catheters, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) catheters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> The composition of the invention may be administered by injection to achieve a systemic effect against relevant bacteria shortly before insertion of an in-dwelling device. Treatment may be continued after surgery during the in-body time of the device. In addition, the composition could also be used to broaden perioperative cover for any surgical technique to prevent bacterial wound infections, especially <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>wound infections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> Many orthopedic surgeons consider that humans with prosthetic joints should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment that could produce a bacteremia. Deep infection is a serious complication sometimes leading to loss of the prosthetic joint and is accompanied by significant morbidity and mortality. It may therefore be possible to extend the use of the active agent as a replacement for prophylactic antibiotics in this situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> In addition to the therapy described above, the compositions of this invention may be used generally as a wound treatment agent to prevent adhesion of bacteria to matrix proteins exposed in wound tissue and for prophylactic use in dental treatment as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, antibiotic prophylaxis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the composition of the invention may be used to bathe an indwelling device immediately before insertion. The active agent will preferably be present at a concentration of 1 mg/ml to 10 mg/ml for bathing of wounds or indwelling devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> A vaccine composition is conveniently in injectable form. Conventional adjuvants may be employed to enhance the immune response. A suitable unit dose for vaccination is 0.5-5 microgram of antigen/kg, and such dose is preferably administered 1-3 times and with an interval of 1-3 weeks. With the indicated dose range, no adverse toxicological effects will be observed with the compounds of the invention that would preclude their administration to suitable individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Sequence Databases, Sequences in a Tangible Medium, and Algorithms </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences form a valuable information resource with which to determine their 2- and 3-dimensional structures as well as to identify further sequences of homology. These approaches are most easily facilitated by storing the sequence in a computer readable medium and then using the stored data in a known macromolecular structure program or to search a sequence database using well-known searching tools, such as GCC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences of the invention are particularly useful as components in databases useful for search analyses as well as in sequence analysis algorithms. As used in this section entitled &ldquo;Sequence Databases, Sequences in a Tangible Medium, and Algorithms,&rdquo; the terms &ldquo;polynucleotide of the invention&rdquo; and &ldquo;polynucleotide sequence of the invention&rdquo; mean any detectable chemical or physical characteristic of a polynucleotide of the invention that is or may be reduced to or stored in a tangible medium, preferably a computer readable form. For example, chromatographic scan data or peak data, photographic data or scan data therefrom, called bases, and mass spectrographic data. As used in this section entitled Databases and Algorithms, the terms &ldquo;polypeptide of the invention&rdquo; and &ldquo;polypeptide sequence of the invention&rdquo; mean any detectable chemical or physical characteristic of a polypeptide of the invention that is or may be reduced to or stored in a tangible medium, preferably a computer readable form. For example, chromatographic scan data or peak data, photographic data or scan data therefrom, and mass spectrographic data. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Identification of the Inhibitory ORF 78 from <highlight><italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic></highlight>Bacteriophage 96 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>propagating strain 96 (PS 96 obtained from the Laboratory Center for Disease Control (CDC) Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario) was used as a host to propagate its respective phage 96 also obtained from CDC. The phage was propagated using the agar layer method described by Swanst&ouml;rm and Adams &lsqb;Swanstr&ouml;m et al. (1951) Proc. Soc. Exptl. Biol. &amp; Med. 78: 372-375&rsqb;. Phage DNA was prepared from the purified phages as described in Sambrook et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. The 96 ORF 78 (SEQ ID NO: 4) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from phage genomic DNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). For PCR amplification, the sense strand primer starts at the initiation codon of SEQ ID NO: 3 and is preceded by a BamHI restriction site; the antisense strand starts at the last stop codon of SEQ ID NO: 3 and is preceded by a SalI restriction site. The PCR product was gel purified and digested with BamHI and SalI. The digested PCR product was then ligated into BamHI- and SalI-digested pTMSLac, a <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>vector containing kanamycin resistance selective marker, and used to transform <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>strain RN4220 &lsqb;Kreiswirth et a/. (1983) Nature 305:709-712&rsqb;. The pTMSLac vector was constructed as followed: the arsenite-inducible promotor and the asrR gene from the pTOO21 vector &lsqb;Tauriainen et al., 1997 Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63:4456-4461&rsqb; were replaced by a lactose-inducible promotor and the lacR gene from <highlight><italic>Staphylococcus aureus. </italic></highlight>Two oligonucleotides corresponding to a 2.18 kb-DNA region encompassing the lacR and the lac operon promotor region were synthesized. The sense strand sequence is (SEQ ID NO: 23) 5&prime;-ccgctcgagCTCCAAATTCCAAAACAG-3&prime; (with a XhoI cloning site); the antisense strand sequence is: (SEQ ID NO: 24) 5&prime;-cgggatccAATAAGACTCCTTTTTAC-3&prime; (with a BamHI cloning site). These two oligonucleotides were used for the PCR amplification of <highlight><italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic></highlight>RN4220 DNA and to construct the pTMSLac vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> In the vector, pTMSMLac 960RF78 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>), phage ORF expression is under the control of the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>lac operon promoter/operator. Selection of recombinant clones was performed on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 30 &mgr;g/ml of kanamycin. The lactose (lac) genes of <highlight><italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic></highlight>have been shown to be inducible with the addition of either lactose or galactose to the culture medium &lsqb;Oskouian &amp; Stewart, 1990, J. Bacteriol. 172: 3804-3812&rsqb;. Galactose (2% w/v) was used to induce the gene expression from the lac promoter/operator in liquid assays. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</cross-reference> to D, the density of the culture, as assessed by OD<highlight><subscript>565 </subscript></highlight>and colony forming units (CFU), for <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>clones harboring 96 ORF 78 increased over time under non-induced conditions. Similar growth rates were also observed with transformants harboring a non-inhibitory ORF (labeled as &lsquo;non killer&rsquo; on the graphs) under both induced and non-induced conditions. Each graph represents the average obtained from three independent transformants of <highlight><italic>S. aureus. </italic></highlight>The expression of 96 ORF 78 inhibits the bacterial growth as observed by the reduction in CFU with time for induced cultures. At 4 h following induction, the expression of 96 ORF 78 is cytocidal resulting in a 1 log inhibition reduction in the number of CFU compared to the number of CFU initially present in the same culture (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>). When colony plating was done in the absence of kanamycin, the antibiotic necessary to maintain the selective pressure for the plasmid encoding 96 ORF 78 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>), the extent of growth inhibition was reduced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> To identify the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>protein(s) that interacts with inhibitory ORF 78 of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>bacteriophage 96, a GST-fusion of 96 ORF 78 was generated. The recombinant protein was purified and utilized to make a GST/96ORF78 affinity column. Cellular extracts prepared from <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>cells were incubated with the affinity matrix and the matrix was washed with buffers containing increasing concentrations of salt and different detergents. The protein elution profile was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A protein of molecular mass &tilde;72 kDa, identified as PT72, was specifically eluted from the affinity matrix (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) and was not detected in eluates from the GST negative control column (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). Eluted proteins were further characterized to determine the identity of the interacting protein and to validate the interaction of the protein with 96 ORF 78 as described in detail below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> Bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 was sub-cloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Pharmacia), an expression vector for in-frame translational fusions with Glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The gene encoding 96 ORF 78 was obtained by digestion of pTMSMLac 960RF78 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) with BamHI and SalI. The DNA fragment containing ORF78 was gel purified by QiaQuick&trade; spin column (Qiagen) and ligated into pGEX 4T-1 (which had been previously digested with BamHI and Sail) to generate pGEX 4T GST/ORF78. Recombinant expression vectors were identified by restriction enzyme analysis of plasmid minipreps. Large-scale DNA preparations were performed with Qiagen columns, and the resulting plasmid was sequenced. Test expression in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>cells containing the expression plasmids were performed to identify optimal protein expression conditions. <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DH5&agr; cells containing the expression constructs were grown at 37&deg; C. in 2 L Luria-Bertani broth to an OD<highlight><subscript>600 </subscript></highlight>of 0.4 to 0.6 (1 cm pathlength) and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-&bgr;-D-galactosidase (IPTG) for the optimized time (3 h) and at the optimized temperature (20&deg; C.). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> Cells containing GST/96 ORF 78 fusion protein were suspended in 10 ml GST lysis buffer/liter of cell culture (GST lysis buffer: 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1 PMSF) and lysed by French Pressure cell followed by three bursts of twenty seconds with an ultra-sonicator at 4&deg; C. The lysate was centrifuged at 4&deg; C. for 30 minutes at 10 000 rpm in a Sorval SS34 rotor. The supernatant was applied to a 4 ml glutathione sepharose column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer and allowed to flow by gravity. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer and eluted in 4 ml fractions with GST elution buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 25 mM reduced glutathione). The fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE (Laemmli) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 stain to assess the amount of eluted GST/96 ORF 78 protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> C. Removal of GST from GST/96 ORF 78 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> GST/96 ORF 78 (2.5 ml at 1.0 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5,150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA at 4&deg; C. for 3 hours. The dialyzed protein was digested with 80 units bovine thrombin protease at room temperature in the presence of 2.5 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for 2 hours to cleave the GST domain from the ORF domain, and the extent of digestion was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The GST/96 ORF 78 was subjected to an additional overnight digestion (18&deg; C.) with a different preparation of thrombin and again the extent of digestion was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stain. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine and NaCl to a 1 M final concentration. The digested GST/96 ORF 78 was applied to a 1.5 ml glutathione sepharose column to resolve the GST and undigested GST/96 ORF 78 from 96 ORF 78. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> A <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>extract was prepared from the cell pellets using lysostaphin digestion followed by sonication and nuclease digestion. The cell pellet (2.9 g) was suspended in 8 ml of 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5,150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgSO<highlight><subscript>4, 10 </subscript></highlight>mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2, 1 </subscript></highlight>mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, 1000 units of lysostaphin, 0.5 mg RNase A, 750 units micrococcal nuclease, and 375 units DNase 1. The cell suspension was incubated at 37&deg; C. for 30 minutes, cooled to 4&deg; C., and made up to a final concentration of 1 mM EDTA and 500 mM NaCl. The lysate was sonicated on ice using three bursts of 20 seconds each. The lysate was centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 1 hr in a Ti70 fixed angle Beckman rotor. The supernatant was removed and dialyzed overnight in a 10 000 M<highlight><subscript>r </subscript></highlight>dialysis membrane against Affinity Chromatography Buffer (ACB; 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA) containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM PMSF. The dialyzed protein extract was removed from the dialysis tubing and frozen in one ml aliquots at &minus;70&deg; C. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> GST and GST/96 ORF 78 were dialyzed overnight against ACB buffer containing 1 M NaCl. 96 ORF 78 protein obtained from thrombin digestion of GST/96 ORF 78 was used without dialysis. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay and proteins were crosslinked to Affigel 10 resin (Bio-Rad) at protein/resin concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml. The crosslinked resin was sequentially incubated in the presence of ethanolamine and bovine serum albumin (BSA) prior to column packing and equilibration with ACB containing 100 mM NaCl. <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>extracts were centrifuged at 4&deg; C. in a micro-centrifuge for 15 minutes and diluted to 5 mg/ml with ACB containing 100 mM NaCl. Aliquots of 400 &mgr;l of extract were applied to 40 &mgr;l columns containing 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml ligand and ACB containing 100 mM NaCl (400 ul) was applied to an additional column containing 2.0 mg/ml ligand. The columns were washed with ACB containing 100 mM NaCl (400 ul) and sequentially eluted with ACB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 100 mM NaCl (100 ul), ACB containing 1 M NaCl (160 ul), and 1% SDS (160 ul). For further analysis, 80 ul of each eluate was resolved by 16 cm 14% SDS-PAGE &lsqb;Laemmli, U.K. (1970) Nature 227: 680-685&rsqb; and the protein was visualized by silver stain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> F. Affinity Chromatography </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> A candidate polypeptide of 72 kDa (PT72) was recovered from affinity columns containing either GST/96 ORF 78 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) or 96 ORF 78 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). PT72 was recovered in the 1 M NaCl eluates and in the 1% SDS eluates of the GST/96 ORF 78 chromatography experiment. PT72 was observed in the 1% SDS eluates of the 96 ORF 78 (GST removed) chromatography experiment. The PT72 polypeptide was not observed in the GST control affinity chromatography experiment. An estimation of the relative abundance of PT72 proteins in the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>extract relies upon the assumption that nearly quantitative recovery of the candidate interacting protein has occurred during the affinity chromatography. Affinity chromatography experiments with the 5 mg/ml lysostaphin extract using ligands GST/ORF78 yielded approximately 50 ng of PT72 in the eluate of the 2.0 mg/ml column. Although protein quantitation from silver stained SDS-PAGE gels is only approximate, the estimated abundance of PT72 in the extracts is approximately 0.01% of the total cellular protein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> The candidate protein PT72 was excised from SDS-PAGE gels and prepared for tryptic peptide mass determination by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. &lsqb;Qin, J., et al. (1997) Anal. Chem. 69, 3995-4001&rsqb;. As exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, high quality mass spectra were obtained. The PT72 proteins observed in the two affinity chromatography experiments (eluates presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>) were identical as determined by the masses of the tryptic peptides. The gel slice containing PT72 was found to contain a single protein. The PT72 band was identified as an open reading frame (herein referred as &lsquo;STAAU_R9&rsquo;) found in Contig 286 of the University of Oklahoma genome sequencing project database (http://www.genome.ou.edu/staph.html). PT72 is highly similar, although not identical, to <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>DnaG (gi&verbar;2494147&verbar;sp&verbar;005338&verbar;PRIM_STAAU DNA PRIMASE, gi&verbar;1943994&verbar;dbj&verbar;BAA19493.1&verbar; (AB001896). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the result of the optimal global amino acid sequence aligment of STAAU_R9 with the described <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>DnaG (Swissprot No: 005338) reveals a 92% identify between the two polypeptides. The discrepancies between the sequences of DNA primase from <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>as reported in Swissprot and as reported in the University of Oklahoma <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>genome sequencing project database is noteworthy. The N-terminal sequence of STAAU_R9 (SEQ ID NO: 2) was predicted based on the presence of a fragment of 1171.623 in the mass spectrum (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). This tryptic-digested fragment corresponds to the mass predicted from the sequence (SEQ ID NO: 24: IDQSIINEIK) extending from amino acid residue 5 to 14 of the deduced amino acid sequence of STMU_R9. In addition, the 5&prime; DNA sequence of STAAU_R9 on the genome of <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>strain RN4220 was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequence analyses with the following primer pair; (SEQ ID NO: 25) 5&prime;-GCGCATCTGTAAAACCACG-3&prime; AND (SEQ ID NO: 26) 5&prime;-GCACGAATTCAAGAAGAATTG-3&prime;. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> also shows that STAAU_R9 is similar to several bacterial DNA primases including DnaG polypeptides of <highlight><italic>B. stearothermophilus, B. subtilis </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>with identities of 34%, 36% and 27%, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows the results of the STAAU_R9 Hidden Markov Model searching analysis of the publicly available Pfam database identifying two highly related Pfam motifs in the STAAU_R9 region spanning amino acid position 1 to 339. STAAU_R9 harbors a N-terminal zinc finger-binding domain that could be involved in template DNA recognition and a Toprim domain, located centrally, and which corresponds to a conserved catalytic domain in bacterial DnaG-type primases. The C-terminal region of STAAU_R9 is only weakly conserved amongst bacterial DNA primases as exemplified in the optimal global amino acid sequences alignment presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The initiation codon used to amplified STAAU_R9 (TTG corresponding to a leucine) corresponds to the predicted start codon of STAAU_R9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the sense strand primer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>; SEQ ID NO: 8) targets the initiation codon and is preceded by a EcoRI restriction site; the antisense oligonucleotide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>; SEQ ID NO: 9) targets the stop codon and is preceded by a BglII restriction site. The PCR product was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and digested with EcoRI and BglII. The digested PCR product was ligated to EcoRI- and BglII-digested pGADT7 vector (Clontech Laboratories), yielding pGADSTAAU_R9. A similar strategy was used for the cloning of STAAU_R9 into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech Laboratories), yielding pGBKSTAAU_R9. Bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>; SEQ ID NO: 4) was fused either to the carboxyl terminus of the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (encoded by the pGBKT7 vector) or to the yeast Gal4 activation domain (encoded by pGADT7). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the 96 ORF 78 was obtained by digestion of pTMSMLac 960RF78 (described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) with BamHI, followed by treatment with Mung bean nuclease and digestion with SalI. The DNA restriction product containing 96 ORF 78 was gel purified and ligated into the SmaI and SalI-digested pGBKT7 expression vector.

<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> As exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> for the STAAU_R9 fragment extending from amino acid 35 to 599, the pGAD and pGBK plasmids bearing different combinations of constructs (as indicated above each pair of petri plates) were introduced into a yeast strain (AH109, Clontech Laboratories), previously engineered to contain chromosomally-integrated copies of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>lacZ and the selectable HIS3 and ADE2 genes. Co-transformants were plated in parallel on yeast synthetic medium (SD) supplemented with amino acid drop-out lacking tryptophan and leucine (TL minus) and on SD supplemented with amino acid drop-out lacking tryptophan, histidine, adenine and leucine (THAL minus). Co-transformants harbouring the 96 ORF 78 polypeptide only grew on selective SD THAL minus medium in the presence of STAAU_R9. Induction of the reporter HIS3 and ADE2 genes is dependent upon the interaction of STAAU_R9 with 96 ORF 78 since co-transformants with appropriate control plasmids (pGBKT7LaminC or pGADT7-T) are not viable on SD THAL minus medium. The only exception is the growth of yeast co-transformed with pGKB STAAU_R9 and the control pGADT7-T plasmids on SD THAL minus medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> The interaction of STAAU_R9 and 96 ORF 78 is also clearly demonstrated by the observed 10-fold increase, over the background level, of the &bgr;-galactosidase activity in both 96 ORF 78-STAAU_R9 co-transformants (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, Sample ID 1 and 4). These results are consistent with the interpretation that the <highlight><italic>S. aureus </italic></highlight>STAAU_R9 identified herein is the host target of bacteriophage 96 ORF 78. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> In parallel experiments, each pGAD vector harboring STAAU_R9 truncation fragments was introduced into AH 109 yeast cells with the pGBK vector containing 96 ORF 78 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>). The resulting co-transformants were analyzed for their ability to induce expression of reporter genes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> shows the results of interaction for each STAAU_R9-related fragment with 96 ORF 78. Portions of STAAU_R9 extending from amino acids residues 561 to 599 (herein referred to as SEQ ID NO: 6 or STAAU_R9 561 599) was found to interact with bacteriophage 96 ORF 78 since the introduction of appropriate plasmids into host yeast cells resulted in their growth on THAL minus SD medium (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</cross-reference>; top pair of petri plates).
