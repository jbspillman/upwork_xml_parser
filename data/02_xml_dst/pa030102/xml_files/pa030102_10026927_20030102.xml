<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to a level shifter, and more particularly to, a level shifter capable of level-shifting a positive voltage level and a negative voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, if it is desired to level-shift a level of a given node in a circuit to a zero voltage level, a negative voltage level, a VCC level or a positive high voltage level, a level shifter is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a conventional level shifter for level-shifting a zero voltage level to a negative voltage level. An operation of the level shifter in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> will be described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> If a control signal ENb is at HIGH state, a first output node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of an inverter INV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes a LOW state. Therefore, a second PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on. An output OUT becomes a Vcc state by turn-on of the second PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As the output OUT is at a HIGH state, a first NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on while a second NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is kept to be turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, if the control signal ENb is changed from a HIGH state to a LOW state, a first PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on and the voltage level of a second node n<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes thus a HIGH state. Thus, the second NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on and the output OUT is changed from a Vcc state to a zero voltage level. Next, if the voltage level of VEEX is at a negative voltage level, the output OUT becomes a negative voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a conventional level shifter for level-shifting a Vcc level to a Vpp level. An operation of the level shifter in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be below described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If the control signal EN is at a LOW state, a third output node n<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a second inverter INV<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at a HIGH state, so that a fourth NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on. Therefore, a third POMS transistor MP<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on and the output OUT remains a zero voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, if the control signal EN is changed from a LOW state to a HIGH state, a third NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on and a fourth PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is thus turned on, so that the output OUT becomes a Vcc level. At this time, if VPPX is raised from Vcc to Vpp with VPPX being Vcc and the output OUT being Vcc, the output OUT is also changed to Vpp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a conventional level shifter for level-shifting a zero voltage level and a Vcc level to a negative voltage level and a Vpp level, respectively. For explanation&apos;s convenience, only a level shift process will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> If a control signal INb is at a HIGH state, the first output node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the inverter INV<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes a LOW state. As the second PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on, a fifth NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is turned on and the output OUT thus remains a zero voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Then, if the voltage level of VEEX is lowered from a zero voltage level to a negative level, the output OUT becomes a negative voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As the third output node n<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the second inverter INV<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is at a HIGH state when the control signal INb is at LOW state, the fourth NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on and a fifth POMS transistor MP<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is turned on. Therefore, the output OUT is kept to be a Vcc voltage level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> At this time, if VPPX is raised from Vcc to Vpp with VPPX being Vcc and the output OUT being Vcc, the output OUT is also changed to Vpp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it can be understood that a transistor constituting the level shifter are so many. If this level shifter is used for a portion of a core circuit in a chip, it could be a severe load. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described in detail by way of a preferred embodiment with reference to accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a level shifter according to the present invention. An operation of the level shifter in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> will be described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Initially, VPPX is set to a VCC level and VEEX is set to a zero level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, if a control signal IN become a HIGH state, as a first NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on, a first node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes a LOW state and a second PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on, so that a third node n<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes a Vtp state. Also, a second NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on and a second node n<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes a LOW state. Thus, a fourth NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned off while a fourth PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on, so that a fourth node n<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> becomes a HIGH state. As a third NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on, the fourth NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is completely turned off, so that the output OUT becomes a VPPX state. Next, if VPPX is raised from Vcc to Vpp, the output is also raised to Vpp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, if the control signal IN is at a LOW state, a first PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on and the first node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes a HIGH state. Thus, the second NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on and the second node n<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> becomes a Vcc-Vtn state, so that the fourth PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is almost turned off. In addition, as the second PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on and the third node n<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> becomes a HIGH state, the fourth NMOS transistor MN<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on. Therefore, as the voltage level of the fourth node n<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> becomes a zero voltage level, a third PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on and the fourth PMOS transistor MP<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is thus completely turned off, so that VEEX is transmitted to the output OUT. If VEEX is lowed from a zero voltage level to a negative voltage level VEE, the output OUT is also lowered to VEE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the present invention has an advantage that it can implement a level shifter of various levels such as positive and negative voltage and the like by using a small number of transistor compared to a conventional level shifter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
