<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A transmitter with a pulse width modulation amplifier includes an inner positive feedback loop, which has a self oscillating modulator and a switching stage and is connected to an LP filter. Outer feedback loops from the LP filter respective from an output transformer are coupled to a compensation block connected to the inner loop. An input telecommunications signal, fed via the compensation block, is superimposed on a carrier from the modulator into a pulse width modulated signal, which is amplified, filtered and fed to the transformer. The input signal is compared with feedback signals. Phase shift caused by the LP filter is partly compensated by the inner loop. A switching frequency in the modulator therefore can be comparatively low. An output impedance is kept on a predetermined level, enabling connection of a receiver. Advantages are low power dissipation, high packing density, high frequency bands and use in bidirectional communication. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a method and an apparatus for transmitting telecommunications signals. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The demand for high speed telecommunications transmission has grown rapidly in later years. I order to provide such high speed telecommunications transmission, wide bandwidths including high frequencies are being used. Ordinary copper wires, originally intended for analogue telephony, are upgraded to Digital Subscriber Lines DSL, using various transmission techniques. The analogue bandwidth of about 4 kHz, is often increased to several MHz. However, the handling of high bandwidths puts several requirements on the transmission equipment in terms of frequency response, linearity, distortion, noise etc and especially power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various transmission and encoding techniques are used for the abovementioned upgrading, e.g. Discrete Multi Tone DTM, for handling ADSL transmission on ordinary copper wires. Generally, all DSL transmission methods, regardless of type (ADSL, VDSL, HDSL, SHDSL etc.), involve a transmission design based on certain digital parts, e.g. DSPs, CODECs and analogue front-end parts with linear broadband amplifiers for both the transmit and receive direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The abovementioned amplifiers are typically based on traditional broadband amplifiers using Class A, Class A/B, Class B or even Class G amplifier principles. These amplifier classes are all characterised by having a &ldquo;built-in&rdquo; power dissipation because of the design principle itself. The amplifiers have ordinary push-pull transistor coupling with a constant bias current in order to reduce e.g. cross over distortion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The DSL transmission requires typically 100 mW of power transmitted to the line. In order to handle this transmission power, the ordinary amplifiers dissipate up to approximately 800 mW or even 900 mW. The Class G amplifier, using two supply voltages, may reduce the dissipation to approximately 600 mW or even less. Still there is currently a substantial power dissipation around five or six times higher than the required power transferred to the line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This very high power dissipation and consumption leads to an expensive and bulky implementation, which becomes increasingly more challenging to handle in Central Office development. The amount of broadband subscribers are also expected to increase rapidly in the coming years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the international patent application with publication number WO 98/19391 is described the use of a Class D amplifier for the audio frequency range. The Class D amplifier is a Pulse Modulation Amplifier PMA and has among others the advantages that the power dissipation is very low, low complexity and good fidelity. The PMA disclosed in the WO-application includes a pulse modulator including a power amplifier stage. The power amplifier output has one or more negative feedback loops to preamplifiers preceding the modulator. In one disclosed embodiment the pulse modulator is a self oscillating modulator. The PMA is connected to a loudspeaker and has a low output impedance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention deals with the problem of reducing power dissipation in a telecommunications transmitter. A further problem is to transmit signals of a predetermined frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Still a problem is to make it possible to utilize the transmitter in bidirectional communication, i.e. to make it possible to connect a receiver at the transmitter output to a telecommunications line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another problem is to utilize the transmitter on limited space or with high packing density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A purpose with the present invention is to reduce power dissipation in a telecommunications transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A further purpose is to transmit signals of a predetermined frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still a purpose is to make it possible to utilize the transmitter in bidirectional communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another purpose is to utilize the transmitter on limited space or with high packing density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The solution of the problem resides in the insight that a transmitter, having a pulse width modulation amplifier and a controlled self oscillating modulator, can be used for transmitting telecommunication signals in a predetermined frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In some more details the solution includes loop coupling a switching stage with a self oscillating modulator, the latter generating a carrier signal. An incoming signal modulates the carrier and is fed to the switching stage, where it is amplified. The amplified signal is filtered and fed to a load and also loop coupled to the transmitter input. The output impedance is adjusted to a finite value so that it can serve as a termination for a far end transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An advantage with the invention is that the transmitter has low power dissipation. It can therefore in a convenient way be utilized in e.g. a central office with several transmitters and high packing density. It can also be used when the space is limited, e.g. in a customer modem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A further advantage is that the transmitter can be utilized for a predetermined frequency band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Still an advantage is that the transmitter can be utilized for bidirectional communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The invention will now be described more in detail with the aid of prefered embodiments in connection with enclosed figures.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the general transmission design for different DSL transmission methods (ADSL, VDSL, HDSL, SHDSL etc.). A chip set <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on e.g. a line card includes a digital signal processor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (DSP) connected to a coder/decoder <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (CODEC), which in turn is connected to a block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a set of transmitters <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and receivers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A pair of transmitter/receiver is connected to a line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for incoming and outgoing signals. A digital equipment <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is connected to the DSP <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a line <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. A signal S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, incoming to the chip set <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the line <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, is signal processed in the DSP <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the CODEC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into a signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is inputted to the transmitter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is further processed in the transmitter, including an amplification, and is transmitted as a signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. An incoming signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is received by the receiver <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the chip set <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes several transmitters/receivers and e.g. a central office can include a great number of chip sets on its line cards. The packing density of components can be rather high and it is essential that the power dissipation from each transmitter/receiver is restricted. To bring about this power dissipation restriction, an amplifier of the earlier mentioned Class D can be utilized. The transmitter described in the present document is such a Class D amplifier, which is advantageously utilized in the chip set <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a diagram with a simplified overview over the efficiency for different classes of amplifiers. The diagram shows how the efficiency n in % varies with the frequency f in kHz. A line Al shows that a Class A amplifier has an efficiency of about 10% in all the frequency range and a line B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shows that a Class B amplifier lies around 25%. A curve D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates the frequency dependence of today&apos;s Class D amplifiers, having an efficiency of about 95% at frequencies below 20 kHz, which falls to about 50% at 2 MHz. Curves D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> indicates the efficiency for Class D amplifiers that can be foreseen in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a simplified view over some application areas for the present transmitter. A Central Office (CO) in a telesystem has a central office equipment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is connected to a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), a modem <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, via a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The CO equipment <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the CPE <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> have each a transmitter as described in the present document. The transmitter can be designed to handle all types of DSL applications, e.g. ADSL, VDSL, SDSL, HDSL and S.HDSL. These applications all use encoded high-speed transmission over copper pairs, such as the copper pairs of the DSL <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The bandwidth of the digital transmission is in the range of 1 MHz and higher, compared to the normally used analogue transmission bandwidth for a copper pair of about 4 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The technology of the present transmitter can also be used for high-speed transmission over CATV networks. In this case the transmission media can be a coaxial copper line. It is also possible to use optical fiber as transmission media and it is foreseen that even wireless transmission media, in the frequenzy range of the order of 1 GHz, can be utilized. However, currently it might be problems in reaching the required efficiency in the radio frequency range due to the state of the semiconductor technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the abovementioned pulse width modulation amplifiers, Class D amplifiers, an input signal to be amplified is superimposed onto a carrier signal. The resulting signal is fed through a comparator, where a pulse width modulated signal is generated. The pulse width modulated signal is then amplified in a switching stage, and fed via a low pass filter where the amplified signal is demodulated. In traditional Class D amplification, an external carrier signal with constant frequency is used. Intermodulation products will be produced in the switching stage, located, in the frequency domain, around the frequency of the carrier signal. Hence the frequency of the external carrier signal has to be considerably higher than the highest frequency of the signal to be transmitted, typically by 20-30 times. The use of high frequencies in the switching stage introduces noise to the output signal, the noise level increasing with frequency. Furthermore, the higher the frequency of the carrier signal is, the higher are the power losses in the circuits. The high frequency performance of today&apos;s components makes it difficult to provide an output signal of acceptable quality at the frequencies that would be required as external carrier frequencies in telecommunications applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A prior art Class D amplifier for the audio frequency range with low carrier signal frequency will be shortly commented in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The amplifier is disclosed in detail in the previous mentioned patent application WO 98/19391. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a digital switching amplifier having a controlled self-oscillating pulse modulator <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> followed by a switching amplifier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The output from this amplifier is connected to a filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and to a feedback loop having a block <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the output of which is connected to an input of a forward block <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The block <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> has a further input for an insignal V<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>to be amplified and an output to the modulator <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. An output from the filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is connected to a loudspeaker <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The blocks <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> are formed to give controlled and stable self-oscillating conditions. An output signal V<highlight><subscript>sw </subscript></highlight>from the amplifier <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is passed through the block <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and superimposed on the insignal V<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, giving the desired pulse modulation effect. The output signal V<highlight><subscript>sw </subscript></highlight>is filtered into an amplified signal V<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>for the loudspeaker <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The amplifier in WO 98/19391 has the properties of low power dissipation due to high efficiency, good fidelity in the audio frequency range, low complexity and low output impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A main difference between the amplifier in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and traditional Class D amplifiers is that the traditional amplifiers have an externally generated carrier signal with constant frequency, while the amplifier in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> has a carrier signal internally generated in the circuit formed by the blocks <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. This difference gives rise to frequency properties which will be described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a diagram for the amplifier in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> with the internally generated carrier. The diagram shows signals of frequencies f having an amplitude A. Signals to be transmitted are within a frequency band <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having a frequency range 0-f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the self-oscillating modulator <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has a switching frequency f<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>Intermodulation frequencies are generated in the switching stage <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, giving rise to side bands S<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>22</subscript></highlight>. An influence of the sideband on the band <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is avoided in the amplifier of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, if the switching frequency f<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is of the order of five times the frequency f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a diagram similar to the diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, but for a conventional pulse modulating amplifier with externally generated carrier. This carrier has a switching frequency f<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>having a sideband S<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>of intermodulation frequencies. To avoid influence of the sideband on the band <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> the carrier frequency f<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>must, as mentioned above, typically be 20 to 30 times the frequency fl. As also mentioned, this high frequency gives rise to certain problems, among others low efficiency and high power dissipation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an exemplifying embodiment <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the inventive transmitter. The transmitter comprises an inner feedback loop <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> with positive feedback, having a switching stage <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and a controlled self oscillating modulator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The modulator has a comparator and circuits for generating controlled self oscillations. An output <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the switching stage is coupled to the modulator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, an output <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of which is coupled to an input <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the switching stage. A low pass filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is connected to the output <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a compensation block <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is connected to the input <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In a first outer feedback loop <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> an output <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the low pass filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> has a feedback connection to an input <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the compensation block <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> has also a transformer <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> coupled to the line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The filter output <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected to one end <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a first winding of the transformer <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The same winding has another end <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which is connected to a sense resistor <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a reference potential U. In a second outer feedback loop <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> the transformer winding end <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected to the compensation block input <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via a feedback connection. An incoming line <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for the incoming signals S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the compensation block input <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The transformer <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> has a second winding which is coupled to the line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for the transmitted signals S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the received signals S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The receiver <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected to the respective ends <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the first transformer winding and receives the signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The transmitter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> works in the following manner. The incoming telecommunications signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, having a frequency f<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, is received at the input <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a signal S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the compensation block <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. In this block <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> the signal S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is compared with feedback signals S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> on the respective loops <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to generate a signal S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The signal S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the input <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>where it is superimposed on a carrier signal S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from the self oscillating modulator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> into a pulse width modulated signal S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The signal S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is amplified in the switching stage <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> into a signal S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which is fed back to the controlled self oscillating modulator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In the modulator the carrier signal S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is generated with the aid of the comparator. The signal S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a frequency f<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>in the range of 10 MHz as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The frequency f<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>corresponds to the frequency f<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The amplified signal S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is fed to the low pass filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> which filters out the switching frequency f<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and sends a demodulated signal S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the transformer <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. The transformer in turn transmits the signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The demodulated signal S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fed back to the transmitter input <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The first outer feedback loop <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is a normal negative feedback to get good performance of the transmitter. The linearity will be improved, distortion is reduced and the frequency stability, i.e. a common amplification in all the frequency band, will also be improved. The second outer feedback loop <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is utilised to keep the output impedance at a welldefined value of a predetermined magnitude. A current I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the sense resistor <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> gives rise to a voltage which is sensed and the sensed value is utilised to keep the output at an impedance of 100 ohm in the embodiement. It is essential that the output impedance keeps its welldefined value since a varying output impedance will influence the incoming signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from a far end transmitter and deteroriate the reception in the receiver <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The low pass filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> causes a phase shift in the first outer loop <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> having the compensation block <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the inner feedback loop <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the filter itself. This phase shift can cause a self oscillation in the loop if the switching frequency is too low. In the present transmitter the phase shift in the filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is partly compensated by the self oscillating inner loop <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Therefore the switching frequency f<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>in the present transmitter can be comparatively low, as discussed above. If a conventional outer switching frequency had been used this phase compensation would never take place and a much higher switching frequency, corresponding to the frequency f<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, had to be used. Furthermore, when using the internally generated self oscillating carrier not only the pulse width is modulated but also to some extent the frequency. This contributes to keep the switching frequency f<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>at a low value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> applications of the transmitter with different types of load will be briefly described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a transmitter <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> as described above connected to a digital equipment <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The output of the transmitter is connected to an antenna circuit <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> for a radio antenna <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, which transmits and receives radio signals R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Signals from the equipment <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are amplified in the transmitter <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> before they are transmitted to the antenna circuit. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows in a corresponding way a transmitter <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> connected to a digital equipment <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The output of the transmitter is connected to an optical line <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> via a circuit <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, which includes an optical transmitter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9 a</cross-reference> flow chart over the transmission method in the above transmitter will be described. In a first step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> the telecommunications signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is received in the transmitter <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The received signal, having the frequency f<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, is superimposed on a carrier S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having the frequency f<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the pulse width modulated signal S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is generated, step <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. In a step <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> the pulse width modulated signal S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is amplified in the switching stage <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> into the signal S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This signal is fed back to the controlled self oscillating modulator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, having the oscillation frequency f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. In a next step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> the carrier signal S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is generated in the modulator. The signal S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is also fed to the low pass filter <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> where it is demodulated into the signal S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and in step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> the demodulated signal S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fed to the load. In step <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> the demodulated signal is fed back to the transmitter input to enhance the linearity and frequency stability in normal way. In a step <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> the output impedance of the transmitter is sensed by sensing the voltage over the resistor <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and in a step <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> the output impedance is adjusted to a predetermined value. </paragraph>
