<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For purposes of this patent, the following terms are defined. As used herein, the term &ldquo;air separating unit&rdquo; or &ldquo;air separation unit&rdquo; means and refers to a facility, plant, location or process for separating the components of air and may include both cryogenic and non-cryogenic facilities. As used herein, the terms &ldquo;enhance,&rdquo; &ldquo;enhanced,&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;enhancing,&rdquo; means and refers to an act of altering and/or changing. As used herein, the term &ldquo;oxygen supply&rdquo; means and refers to an oxygen supply with a determinable oxygen content and is not limited nor excluded from a pure supply, but rather, may be any concentration of oxygen and/or oxygen content. As used herein, the term &ldquo;oxygen rich&rdquo; and &ldquo;oxygen rich stream&rdquo; means and refers to a gas or gases having an oxygen content greater than about 21.0% by volume. As used herein, the term &ldquo;blast furnace air&rdquo; or &ldquo;blast furnace feed gas&rdquo; means and refers to feed to a blast furnace to enable reduction of ores, blast furnace feed gas is not limited to one feed supply and may, in some cases, incorporate several sources of feed. As used herein, the term &ldquo;nitrogen rich&rdquo; and &ldquo;nitrogen rich stream&rdquo; means and refers to a gas or gases having an nitrogen content greater than about 80% by volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As well, the use of a particular structure, structures, or embodiments is not meant to be limiting. For instance, the term &ldquo;apparatus&rdquo; or &ldquo;apparatuses&rdquo; means and includes production facilities, plants, and the like. Further, the term &ldquo;process&rdquo; or &ldquo;processes&rdquo; means and includes &ldquo;methods,&rdquo; &ldquo;plans,&rdquo; &ldquo;production plans,&rdquo; and the like. The term &ldquo;led out,&rdquo; &ldquo;fed,&rdquo; &ldquo;feeding,&rdquo; and &ldquo;feed&rdquo; means and refers to allowing out, passing out, discharging, releasing, and/or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Air separation plants are common in the art. Typical air separation units comprise at least one column in which components of air are separated into an oxygen rich liquid and a nitrogen rich gas. Feed gas, such as air, rising in the column is brought into gas-liquid contact in a countercurrent state with a reflux liquid flowing down from above. As a result, the downward liquid flow is gradually enriched in components whose boiling points are higher than that of nitrogen to become an oxygen rich liquid. In the same manner, upward rising vapor is gradually enriched in nitrogen to become a nitrogen rich gas. The degree of separation can be controlled by numerous factors, such as, but not limited to, the number of trays, height of column, number of columns, point of extraction of product, conditions of separation, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Blast furnaces are common in the art and primarily used for extraction of metals from ores, or the removal of oxygen from a metal oxide to produce the metal. A process of this type is commonly referred to as smelting. There are many different structures and types of blast furnaces available for smelting and each one may differ for its particular use or particular metal to produce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are many methods of operation of a blast furnace. Typical methods of operation of a blast furnace entail loading the blast furnace with a charge. The charge typically, but not in all cases, includes a quantity of ore, coke and a flux such as limestone. The charge is loaded into an upper portion of the blast furnace. At the same time, a gas, usually air, is introduced into the blast furnace. Oxygen is necessary in the feed gas for proper functioning of the blast furnace. The oxygen allows, as the feed gas passes through the charge, for a portion of the charge to be oxidized to carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide then reduces the ore and reverts to carbon dioxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The use of oxygen rich gas, such as air, in a blast furnace is desirable for at least the following reasons: (1) with the use of an oxygen enrichment it is possible to switch to powdered charcoal and/or other fuels and to reduce coke consumption in the blast furnace and (2) with the use of an oxygen enrichment, production of the blast furnace may be increased. Accordingly, as the prior art has illustrated, various attempts have been made to facilitate the use of oxygen enrichment. A prior art example of a modification to a blast furnace is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,489. In this patent, an oxygen plant equipped with a mixing column can efficiently treat a portion of blast furnace air to produce oxygen, which is injected into the blast air stream to yield the enriched feed gas. This allows for reducing the mass flow of oxygen-contained gas sent to the furnaces for the reduction of iron ore. More air can therefore be added to the furnace to increase the output of the steel production without increasing the system pressure drop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other prior art integrations are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,268,019 and 5,295,351. These patents describe various possible configurations for integrating an air separation unit with a gas turbine operated with low-BTU gas produced by a blast furnace. Air is extracted from the gas turbine to feed the air separation process. Low-BTU gas is compressed and heat exchanged with the extracted air before feeding the combustion chamber of the gas turbine. In a variant, the fuel is saturated with moisture prior to the expansion step to further increase turbine output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another similar patent is U.S. Pat. No. 5,317,862. This patent describes a similar configuration as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,268,019 and 5,295,351. However, in this patent, the nitrogen stream from the air separation unit is heated, saturated with moisture and expanded to recover energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other examples exist in the prior art for the treatment of a blast furnace, but do not combine various beneficial synergies of an air separation unit and a blast furnace. For example, another prior art example is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,036. This patent describes the possibility of using a double-re-boiler type oxygen plant for blast furnace operation. Another prior art patent is U.S. Pat. No. 6,045,602. This patent describes the integration of the air separation unit and the subsequent gas treatment system to produce hydrogen gas to be used in the direct reduction of iron ore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These prior art examples are beneficial, however, further advantages may be realized. For example, it would be advantageous for steel making companies to be able to increase production of a blast furnace without having to invest in new and/or high cost facilities. Additionally, it would be advantageous to efficiently utilize a blast furnace to maximize a return on investment and/or a more complete utilization of a process gas. As well, it would be advantageous to incorporate at least a portion of the aforementioned improvements while not appreciably increasing a cost of operating a blast furnace. Accordingly, the art field is in search of methods and apparatuses that may achieve at least a portion of these benefits. </paragraph>

On the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents included within the spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Generally, embodiments of the present invention integrate an air separation unit and a blast furnace. In various embodiments of the present invention, combinations of an air separation unit and a blast furnace allow for increased production from the blast furnace and energy recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Various air separating units for accomplishing separation of feed air exist in the prior art and are well known. Generally, in air separating units, feed gas, such as air, is first decarbonated, dried, cooled, and compressed by a compressor or other processes well known in the art. The decarbonating, drying, and cooling of a gas in an air separation unit is performed by equipment such as, but not limited to adsorber unit(s), absorber unit(s), molecular sieve(s), decarbonating-drying apparatuses, and/or the like. The feed gas is then rectified for separation in a rectification column to allow separation of the components of air. In the separation of air, various examples of product gases include a nitrogen-rich gas or liquid, a liquid rich in oxygen (also sometimes called liquid rich or oxygen rich) at the bottom of the column, as well as other constituents of air. For example, the air separation unit as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,717,410 may be used in various embodiments of the present invention, and is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Likewise, blast furnaces are common in the art, as is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,489, incorporated herein by reference. The present invention is not intended to be limited to any particular type of blast furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An illustration of an embodiment of an integrated air separation unit with a blast furnace is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Generally, the present invention is composed of an air separation unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a blast furnace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Blast furnace feed air stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fed to blast furnace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A portion of feed air stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is diverted and/or removed as stream <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Stream <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is then separated into at least an oxygen rich product in air separation unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, stream <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is compressed in compressor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> prior to air separation. To increase the volume of air for air separation, if necessary, stream <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is mixed with additional air <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the resulting mixture, stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is compressed in at least one compressor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to higher pressure as may be required for air separation. Additional air <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be compressed in at least one compressor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> before mixing with stream <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Other embodiments may mix at least one additional air stream <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> with stream <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and compress stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in at least one compressor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> before air separation. Other embodiments may utilize both a compression of additional air <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in at least one compressor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a further compression of stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with at least one compressor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At least a portion of an oxygen rich product, or oxygen rich stream <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, is mixed with a portion of stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form mixed stream <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and fed, at sufficient pressure, to blast furnace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to improve blast furnace performance. In other embodiments, oxygen rich stream <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and feed air stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are not mixed prior to being fed to blast furnace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is typically at a pressure of about three (3) bar to about ten (10) bar. In an embodiment, stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is about at a pressure of five (5) bar. Compression through at least one compressor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> should compress additional air <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to about the pressure of gas stream <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Typical operating pressures for gas stream <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and compressed additional air <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be about three (3) bar to about ten (10) bar. Stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be further compressed to a pressure of up to about twenty (20) bar for air separation. Compressed gas <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may then be fed to air separation unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment disclosed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> product stream <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as a nitrogen product or a nitrogen rich product, is withdrawn from air separation unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and heated in a heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Heater <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be an indirect heat exchanger or a direct heat exchanger, as is common in the art. Heated product stream <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is then expanded in hot expander <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to allow for recovery of energy, such as energy for compression of gas stream <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or stream <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> before air separation. In an embodiment, hot expander <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and at least one compressor associated with air separation unit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are mechanically linked. In such a linked embodiment, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, expansion of stream <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> rotates a shaft that turns compressor <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and/or compressor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, thereby recovering energy of expansion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an illustration of an alternate embodiment of an integrated air separation unit with a blast furnace, a combustion chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown for heating, by direct heat exchange, stream <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> from air separation unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A fuel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, such as off gas <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from blast furnace <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or other hydrocarbon, is burned in combustion chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to heat stream <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to produce a heated product stream <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is hot expanded in a hot expander <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to recover energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Oxygen containing stream <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is fed to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for combustion with fuel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be atmospheric air or any oxygen containing product, such as an oxygen rich stream. Various embodiments can include a bypass <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to allow bypass of at least a portion of stream <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> around chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an illustration of an alternate embodiment of an integrated air separation unit with a blast furnace, a low pressure combustion chamber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is disclosed. In embodiments of this type, fuel <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, such as off gas <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is fed at low pressure, and does not necessarily require further compression, and combusted in chamber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to provide heat for heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> heats gas stream <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, by indirect heat exchange, which is then hot expanded in an expander <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to allow for recovery of energy. In various embodiments, the exhaust gas of expander <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> can be sent to a heat recovery exchanger to preheat stream <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to improve the fuel efficiency of the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention also discloses a process of integrating a blast furnace and an air separation unit. Embodiments of processes of the present invention increase blast furnace production. Generally, processes of the present invention comprise the steps of feeding a gas to a blast furnace, usually air; removing at least a first portion of the feed air before feeding to the blast furnace; separating at least one oxygen rich gas and at least a second stream from the first portion in at least one air separation unit; heating the second stream; expanding the second stream to recover energy; mixing the oxygen rich stream with the blast furnace feed air; and, feeding the mixed feed gas to the blast furnace. Further embodiments include the second stream being heated by a combustion product; removing an off gas, such as a low BTU off gas from the blast furnace, and combusting the off gas in a combustion chamber; mixing another stream with the second stream before expanding the second stream; and, heating the second stream in a heat exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, various other modifications may be made to the present invention while keeping within the scope and content of the claims of the present invention. </paragraph>
