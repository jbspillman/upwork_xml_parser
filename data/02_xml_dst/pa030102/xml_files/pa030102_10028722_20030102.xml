<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for assisting vehicle repair personnel with vehicle repairs. In particular, the present invention relates to methods and systems for providing vehicle-specific service information to persons who desire to perform vehicle repairs. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The repair of automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, and other vehicles requires a vast array of information relating to the specific vehicle that is being serviced. Vehicle service technicians must be able to recognize problems in any number of vehicles, despite the fact that there are design differences between vehicle manufacturers, between models produced by an individual manufacturer, or even between various years of the same model vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Because it is impossible for any individual to be familiar with all aspects of every vehicle that may come into a vehicle repair shop, the technician must rely on reference materials, such as bound volumes of service bulletins, product recall brochures, warranty information sheets, and design manuals to diagnose and repair a potential problem with a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Because there is so much service information available for so many vehicles, the process of searching for relevant literature to help diagnose and repair a vehicle problem can be very time-consuming. Previously, entities that provide service repair information have attempted to solve this problem by providing the information in electronic form, such as a CD-ROM, and allowing the user of the CD-ROM to perform keyword searches of the text contained in the CD-ROM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the prior art attempts to solve the above problems exhibit several disadvantages. For example, the available CD-ROM vehicle service information compilations require that the technician subjectively select a keyword and enter the keyword into a search interface. The results of the search then typically include any and all items on the CD-ROM that contain the keyword or keywords entered by the user. These methods and systems produce irrelevant information which the user must wade through in the hope that relevant information will be found. In addition, these methods and systems can yield unsatisfactory results if the document contained on the CD-ROM uses terminology that differs from the keyword or keywords entered by the user. In addition, these methods and systems do not automatically alert the user if a vehicle abnormality is covered by a manufacturer&apos;s or dealer&apos;s warranty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, we have determined that it is desirable to provide an improved method and system for delivering vehicle service and/or warranty information to assist persons servicing a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to solving one or more of the problems described above. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
