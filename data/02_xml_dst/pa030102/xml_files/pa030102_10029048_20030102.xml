<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method for monitoring operating parameters of a machine (such as a vehicle) and producing diagnostic and/or prognostic results are disclosed. Active, semi-active, or semi-passive sensors are wirelessly linked with an interrogator that selectively interrogates the sensors, such as through transponders in wired communication with the sensors. A data concentrator or processor analyzes data from certain sensors and generates diagnostic/prognostic conclusions, in some cases using additional data selectively requested from and acquired by the sensors. In some embodiments, raw or abstracted data is communicated with a management center that provides troubleshooting information (again, possibly using additional, selectively acquired data), makes resource management decisions (such as preparing parts or labor resources to make a repair), and tracks problems in all or a subset of the machines being managed. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to diagnostic/prognostic techniques, and more particularly, but not exclusively, relates to diagnostic and/or prognostic systems for machines, where the systems include sensors that communicate information through wireless transponders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As machines become more sophisticated, the desire has grown for techniques to determine and/or predict machine failures in a more cost-effective manner. The condition-based maintenance approach of on-board diagnostics and prognostics can substantially reduce the life-cycle costs of owning and operating machines. However, retrofitting existing machines with sensors required for on-board diagnostics and prognostics is often impractical due in large measure to the cost and complexity of installing the necessary wiring and wiring harnesses. Thus, there is an ongoing need for further contributions in this area of technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Present diagnostic and prognostic systems and methods suffer from limitations in ease, cost, and flexibility of installation. There is thus a need for further contributions and improvements to sensor system technology. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved system and method for retrieving and processing sensor data regarding the operation of the machine. This object and others are achieved by various forms of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention is a unique technique for providing diagnostics and/or prognostics for a machine. Other embodiments include unique diagnostic/prognostic systems, apparatus, and methods for machinery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment includes a system for performing diagnostics and prognostics on a machine, especially a mobile or remotely located machine. The system comprises one or more wireless sensors forming a network with one or more sensor interrogators, data concentrators, and/or processing nodes, and a way to communicate the resulting data from the machine to an operator or an automated monitor. This system is arranged to measure operational parameters of the machine with the sensors, where such parameters might include temperature, pressure, vibration, and/or fluid quality, to name just a few. This information stream is relayed to the data concentrator, and analyzed by a processing node to trend certain parameters or sets of parameters. The information stream and resulting trends are used to make predictions as to remaining useful life of machine components, fluids, etc. In one form of this embodiment, the machine is a vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A still further embodiment includes a diagnostic/prognostic system with one or more sensors, a number of wireless transponders (semi-passive, semi-active, and/or active radio frequency (RF) tags) coupled to the sensors, and one or more data collection devices. The one or more data collection devices interrogate the transponders to obtain information about the operation of the vehicle or other machine instrumented with the sensors. By virtue of this wireless technology, sensor networks can be installed on the machine after-market without the need for installation of complex and expensive wiring harnesses. As an alternative or in addition to such retrofits, the system can be configured for new or different applications and upgraded as necessary by installing the required sensors and their associated transponders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, an interrogator wirelessly sends an interrogation signal to a sensor tag. The sensor tag reflects the interrogation signal using backscatter techniques so that the reflected signal indicates a value of an vehicle operating parameter. The interrogator communicates the parameter(s) to a processor, which analyzes the information to make diagnostic and/or prognostic determinations related to the vehicle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the present invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will, nevertheless, be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended; any alterations and further modifications of the described or illustrated embodiments, and any further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein, are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Generally, the system and subsystem illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> flexibly provide diagnostic and prognostic information based on selected vehicle operation data, making that information available to relevant persons and computing processes, and analyzing the data to obtain composite, abstracted, and/or synthesized data relating to multiple time periods and multiple vehicles. Some embodiments can be retrofitted to an existing vehicle without the expense of installing wiring harnesses to physically connect each sensor to the data concentration and analysis component(s) of the system. An alternative embodiment, in which sensor units intercommunicate to acquire and analyze operational data in a stationary system, is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and will be discussed below in relation thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The physical connections between components in vehicle management, monitoring, and maintenance system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will now be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. An on-board subsystem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on some or all vehicles in the system communicates with other major components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via mobile network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and primary data network <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Mobile network <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a cellular telephone system or two-way satellite communication system. Data network <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably (but not necessarily) a single network, such as the Internet, accessible to each major system component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Service solution center (SSC) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises computing units <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and data repository <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, which are discussed in more detail below. Also, connected to this system via data network <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, are one or more fleet operations centers <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, one or more maintenance centers <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, third-party resources <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, and vehicle manufacturer operations center(s) <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The paths for the exchange of data between and among the major components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will now be discussed in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> with continuing reference to elements shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is the communications hub for the components as they exchange data. As discussed in further detail below, on-board sub-systems <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provide selected information concerning the operation of the vehicles in the system to SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which replies with automated and man-in-the-loop responses such as troubleshooting messages and system status updates. SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also stores and performs analysis of performance data using data repository <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and computing unit(s) <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, respectively. SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provides additional services that will be discussed below in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> communicates with fleet operations center <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> regarding the performance and operational status of the vehicles, and with maintenance centers <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> regarding maintenance issues, such as necessary repairs, maintenance, replacement part availability, and technical manuals, to name just a few. In some embodiments, one or more live technicians (represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by dealer support <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) provide some or all of the troubleshooting responses that SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> sends to on-board systems <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Manufacturer <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> also receives information compiled at SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> concerning vehicles it made, and can incorporate that real-world data into future designs. When problems are detected in vehicles being monitored by the system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, manufacturer <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> can also provide automated and/or man-in-the-loop troubleshooting assistance. Furthermore, manufacturer <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> can use the data acquired through SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to manage its manufacturing and distribution of replacement parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Third-party resources <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> also obtain information from and provide services to SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the vehicles being monitored, and the other components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, third-party resources <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> provide emergency services and navigational assistance to driver/operators based on the data acquired from on-board subsystems <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The interaction among various computing components in on-board subsystems <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will now be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. In on-board subsystem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, services <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> are accessible to each primary functional component of subsystem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Exemplary services <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> include communication services <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, authentication services <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, and advisory, alert, and alarm services <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>. Communication service <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> transports data between components of on-board subsystem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and other components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Authentication service <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> protects against unauthorized access to subsystem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and authoritatively identifies subsystem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when it communicates with other components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Advisory, alert, and alarm service <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> accepts requests by various processes to communicate such items to the vehicle operator through display <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). A data acquisition (DAQ) and conditioning component <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> acquires data from on-board sensors (discussed in relation to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> below). DAQ component <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> filters and conditions the data stream provided by the sensors in an attempt to remove &ldquo;bad&rdquo; data (such as noise and detectable errors) before the data is stored, processed, or communicated through the system. Data buffering and management component <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> stores the filtered and conditioned data and provides it to on-board and remote processing components upon request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Diagnostics component <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> analyzes the data to determine whether problems or failures have occurred or are occurring in the vehicles&apos; systems, and if so, what these problems or failures are. Prognostics component <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> monitors the data values and trends to predict the remaining useful life of the vehicles&apos; components, fluids, and the like. In performing these functions, diagnostics component <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and prognostics component <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> can, for example, analyze an incoming data stream from one sensor and, depending on the results, request additional information from another sensor through data buffering and management component <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and DAQ component <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The results of these analyses are used by other components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as will be discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> System status component <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> monitors the values provided by the sensors and communication links to detect failing and failed sensors and/or failed communication links. System status component <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> uses rule-based or neural network-based analysis as would occur to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Operational status component <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> synthesizes an overall &ldquo;health-code&rdquo; for the vehicle. In the illustrated embodiment, a two-character code provides high-level information regarding the functioning of the vehicle to the vehicle&apos;s operator via display <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (see the discussion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> below). For example, &ldquo;OK&rdquo; indicates that all systems are functioning normally, while &ldquo;OC&rdquo; indicates that the system recommends an oil change at the earliest opportune time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises services <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, including communication service <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, authentication service <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, process scheduling service <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, and notification service <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight>. Communication service <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> manages data exchange between the objects and components running in SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and other components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, including on-board subsystems <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Authentication service <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> protects SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from improper access using encryption, passwords, and other methods known to those skilled in the art, as well as authoritatively identifying SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the other components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Process scheduler <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> coordinates and prioritizes activities and/or communications involving SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, whereas notification service <highlight><bold>169</bold></highlight> receives, manages, and distributes notifications among components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (for example, manufacturers&apos; recall notices from manufacturer operations <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> to on-board subsystems <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Data collection component <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> handles interactions between SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and on-board subsystems <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Data collection component <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> feeds that data through access control component <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> to data/information management component <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, which stores the relevant data in data repository <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Prognostics component <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> analyzes the data stored in data/information management component <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, adding its data and computing resources to the activities described for prognostics component <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of on-board subsystems <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When additional information is desired for a prognosis and/or diagnosis analysis or decision by prognostics component <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, the information is requested in a request message from SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to the particular on-board subsystem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The requested information is then acquired by DAQ component <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and communicated back to prognostics component <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> as discussed above in relation to the primary data stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Software agent management component <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> generates, monitors, maintains, and manages software agents as discussed in further detail below. Analysis component <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> provides high-level analyses of data stored in data/information management component <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, as well as data mining functions as would occur to one skilled in the art. Reporting component <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> provides a variety of views of the collected data for reporting to various persons, computers and/or entities as would occur to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An on-board subsystem <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of one embodiment of the present invention will now be discussed in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and may correspond in some embodiments of the invention to an on-board subsystem <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, to which continuing reference will be made. Sub-system <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes a ground transport vehicle <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> with engine compartment <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and vehicle operator compartment <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. A cutaway of engine compartment <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> reveals a schematically depicted control system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Control system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> monitors and regulates operation of engine <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, which is the primary source of motive power for vehicle <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In vehicle operator compartment <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, a display <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> visible by an operator in operator compartment <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is also illustrated, as will be more fully described hereinafter. Telematics control unit (TCU) <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> communicates with control system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and incorporates transceiver functionality for communication between control system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Selected components of subsystem <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> will now be discussed in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, with continuing reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Sensor units <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>(generically and collectively referred to as sensor unit(s) <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>) each detect one or more operating parameters of vehicle <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and convert those parameters to digital values. Interrogator <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> (consisting, for example, of a 430 processor from Texas Instruments of Dallas, Tex., U.S.A., and one or more DSP ICs from Analog Devices, Inc. of Norwood, Mass., U.S.A.) occasionally and selectively interrogates certain individual sensor units <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, which respond by wirelessly transmitting back to interrogator <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> a reply signal to indicate the value(s) of the requested sensed quantities that it most recently detected. This communication is preferably conducted using a published protocol, such as the MIT Auto ID Protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Interrogator <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> converts the reply signal from the respective sensor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> into a digital signal, and forwards that digital signal to data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. Concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> may, for example, be a Redi-Pro Controller from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory of Richland, Wash., U.S.A. Data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> monitors the data values returned from sensors <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and performs analysis on them, such as the computing services and components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As discussed below, certain results of that analysis and outputs of those components are communicated to the operator of the vehicle via display <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, while other results are communicated to SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows some examples of sensors and operating parameters that might be used in some embodiments of the present invention. Sensor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>measures the temperature of coolant in engine <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, while sensor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>measures oil pressure and quality. Sensor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>detects and quantifies vibration in the vehicle&apos;s transmission, while sensor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>measures tire pressure. Data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> monitors these operational parameters to detect any variation outside a proper range of values. For example, the tire pressure detected by sensor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>might properly be 18 PSI, but it may be that little damage is caused or safety risk incurred if the pressure is between about 16 and 20 PSI. Data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> checks the detected values against this range of acceptable values and reports deviations therefrom to the operator of the vehicle via display <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and to the SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> via TCU <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> also checks the detected parameters for rates of change that exceed acceptable levels. This latter technique can provide an earlier warning of a failure. For example, a parameter normally between 75 and 1000 might have several samples near 150 followed by a sample at 700 units. Although the sample is still within the acceptable range, the rapid change could indicate a catastrophic failure that, using the present system, can be immediately detected, investigated, and reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The values and changes in the values over time are also used by data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> to predict failures and more accurately estimate the useful life of various components or the need for service or maintenance work. For example, early replacement of a vehicle&apos;s tires might be indicated following an extended period of operation at tire pressures outside the tires&apos; specifications. That indication is communicated to the operator via display <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> with a message such as &ldquo;TIRE REPLACEMENT INDICATED IN 2000 MILES&rdquo; or by a two-character code (&ldquo;T2&rdquo;, for example) as described above in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A similar message is generated at SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, where automated equipment places an order for the new tires to be delivered at or near the expected location of vehicle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> after it travels about 2000 more miles. Display <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> might or might not indicate whether that information has been transmitted to SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The general structure of sensor units <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> will now be discussed in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> with reference to certain components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. Vehicle <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is instrumented with one or more sensor units <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> that are each communicatively linked to interrogator <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> by a wireless transponder <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. The wireless transponder <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> is in the form of an RF tag arrangement <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the RF tag <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> and sensor unit(s) <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> is/are provided as a unit with which one can retrofit vehicle <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, shown as sensor unit <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, one RF tag <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> can manage data from multiple sensors <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> using techniques that would occur to one skilled in the art. In such embodiments, RF signals <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> can be modulated to elicit responses from a selected one or more sensors <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Interrogator <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> uses radio frequency interrogation signals <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> to selectively stimulate one or more RF tags <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> to receive information sensed with the corresponding sensor(s) <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> in response. In various embodiments, sensor(s) <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> may be one or more of an XTM-190 series miniature pressure transducer (available from Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc., Leona, N.J., U.S.A.), custom-manufactured thermocouples (such as those sold by NANMAC of Framingham, Mass., U.S.A.), a Belhaven ARIS 1-8 channel infrared analyzer (supplied by Belhaven Applied Technologies of Kennewick, Wash., U.S.A.), miniature piston viscometer (such as model 570 or 372J from Cambridge Applied Systems of Medford, Mass., U.S.A.), or elemental analysis components (such as custom-designed components or models CT 5000 or CT 8000 from KeyMaster Technologies of Kennewick, Wash., U.S.A.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the present invention will now be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Generally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprising an oil well <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> that sends oil to station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through pipeline <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Pumping substations <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> pump the fluid from well <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> as is known in the art of oil transport. At each pumping station <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> is installed a sensor unit <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, respectively. In addition, sensor unit <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> is installed in the pipeline segment between pumping stations <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. Sensor unit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> detects operating parameters of well <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The configuration illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> has several properties that are advantageous to many different uses of the invention. For example, certain of sensors <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> communicate with each other. Data from sensor unit <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> can be communicated through sensor unit <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> and antenna <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> to data storage and analysis resources at station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In fact, the sensor units <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> at pumping stations <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, respectively, can communicate not only with base station antenna <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and sensor units on adjacent pumping stations, but also with sensor units on pumping stations that are two segments away (e.g., the sensor unit <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> at pumping station <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> can communicate directly with sensor unit <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> at pumping station <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, which can communicate directly with antenna <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>). In this manner, even if a single sensor unit fails, information can still be shared between the main station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and sensor units further down the line from the failed sensor unit, without the base station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> having to communicate directly with each sensor unit. Likewise, requests for additional data can still travel from station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to sensors upstream of the failed unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Sensor units <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> communicate their data to station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> via sensor unit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and transceiver/antenna <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, sensor unit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> comprises logic that analyzes data from sensor units <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> to generate status information and/or higher-level data for communication to station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, sensor unit <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> further comprises logic to generate alerts based on the sensed data, as was discussed above in relation to diagnostics and prognostics components <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Transceiver/antenna <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> communicates the sensed and/or abstracted data through public switched telephone network (PSTN) <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> with station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> constantly, periodically, and/or upon generation of an alarm event by the sensor network as discussed above in relation to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The communications link between transceiver/antenna <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and PSTN <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may be of the conventional digital or analog variety. In some variations of this embodiment, the connection between transceiver/antenna <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and station <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is a direct data link of either a wired or wireless variety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Encryption and authentication techniques are applied to the data exchanged among components of system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, as mentioned above in relation to components <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. These techniques might, for example, use public-key cryptography, shared-key (or &ldquo;private key&rdquo;) cryptography, Diffie-Hillman key agreement techniques, message authentication codes (MACs), message digests, and other techniques as would occur to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is noted that, as used herein, &ldquo;machine&rdquo; may be broadly interpreted to encompass any wholly or partially mechanical system that has or interacts with an environment having a measurable quantity that reflects a system status or performance. Of many possibilities, some examples include vehicles, stationary manufacturing equipment, computers, and buildings. In addition, a &ldquo;subsystem&rdquo; is a system designed, arranged, or adapted to be used in, or integrated with other components to make up another system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it will be seen by those skilled in the art that a variety of types of data may be communicated between components of this system. For example, in system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a sensor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> might provide spectrum analysis data to data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, which could detect water in the engine&apos;s oil system based on that data. Data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> might then communicate a &ldquo;water in the oil&rdquo; signal via TCU <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A person or computing process at SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> could then send a response message back, comprising a request for temperature and vehicle speed data. Data concentrator <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> then uses interrogator <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> to acquire the requested data, then communicates that data back to SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in one or more reply messages. Depending on the information in the reply message(s), SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can issue advice to the operator of vehicle <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> regarding operation of that vehicle until repairs are made, can prepare for staffing needs at a maintenance center <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and can adjust fleet scheduling through a fleet operations center <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The ability provided by the present invention to interactively and selectively inquire of various sensors would, at least in this case, reduce the amount of information that had to be continuously exchanged between vehicle <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and SSC <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in order to make informed diagnosis/prognosis decisions, to enable integration with many outside systems, and to allow a much more complete diagnosis without requiring wired connections between the sensors, analysis hardware, and telematics hardware. Many additional advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Sensor units <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and their components may be powered in several different ways, depending on the particular sensor configuration, the location of sensors in the vehicle, cost constraints, and other design criteria, as would occur to one skilled in the art. For example, RF tags <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> may be powered by vehicle power, a battery connected to the tag, or the interrogation signal itself, to name just a few options. It is noted that, although the above description uses terminology characteristic of communications using active or semi-active tags, the invention may also be implemented without undue experimentation in systems that use semi-passive RF tags in systems that use semi-passive RF tags. Some such implementations have the advantage over active-tag embodiments of lower power requirements and complexity at the sensor site, which enables sensors to be placed in locations not typically serviceable by active tags. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only selected embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that would occur to one skilled in the relevant art are desired to be protected. </paragraph>
