<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of and apparatus for generating a reader-to-writer offset for a head positioned over a track on a disc in a disc drive having a plurality of tracks is disclosed.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to head offset calibration in a disc drive, and, in particular, to measuring optimal reader-to-writer offset of a head for reduced track misregistration (TMR). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Disc drives are data storage devices that store digital data in magnetic form on a rotating storage medium called a disc. Modern disc drives comprise one or more rigid discs that are coated with a magnetizable medium and mounted on the hub of a spindle motor for rotation at a constant high speed. Each surface of a disc is divided into several thousand tracks that are tightly-packed concentric circles similar in layout to the annual growth rings of a tree. The tracks are typically numbered starting from zero at the track located outermost the disc and increasing for tracks located closer to the center of the disc. Each track is further broken down into data sectors and servo bursts. A data sector is normally the smallest individually addressable unit of information stored in a disc drive and typically holds 512 bytes of information plus additional bytes for internal drive control and error detection and correction. This organization of data allows for easy access to any part of the discs. A servo burst is a particular magnetic signature on a track, which facilitates positioning of heads over tracks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, each of the multiple discs in a disc drive has associated with it two heads (one adjacent the top surface of the disc and another adjacent the bottom) for writing and reading data to or from a sector. Each head is mounted at the distal end of an actuator arm that extends toward the disc and pivots about the bearing shaft assembly connected to a voice coil motor in the disc drive. A read element (or a reader) and a write element (or a writer) are mounted on each head. A gap separates the reader and writer along the longitudinal axis of the actuator arm. The head skew angle, which is the angle between a tangential line to a track and the line drawn along the longitudinal axis of the actuator arm, changes as the head moves from the inner diameter to the outer diameter of the disc, and vice versa. The combination of the gap and the varying head skew angle causes the radial distance between the path of the reader on the disc and the path of the writer on the disc to be variable as the head moves from the inner diameter to the outer diameter of the disc, and vice versa. This varying radial distance between the reader and the writer is known as the reader-to-writer offset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, the data storage format of a track is comprised of an alternating sequence of address headers (including servo fields) and data fields on a track. The address headers store address information, which identifies the respective addresses of the data fields. The data fields store user data. Two methods are typically used to write the address headers and data fields. The first method is to write the alternating address headers and data fields as close to the center of the track as possible. The second method is to write them in alternating sequence but to write the data fields at an offset from the servo fields in order to take into account the presence of the reader-to-writer offset. The basic difference between the first method and the second method is that the first method requires a micro minijog of the actuator arm during a write operation whereas the second method requires a micro minijog of the actuator arm during a read operation. For example according to the first method, during a write operation, the reader first reads the address headers and compares them to the target address. If the address read from an address header matches the target address, the writer writes the data in the data field. However, as soon as a target data field has been identified, the actuator arm must perform a minijog to position the writer over the data field so that the writer can write data in the target data field. The reader-to-writer offset is the distance the actuator arm must displace in order to position the writer over the target data field. This micro minijog of the actuator arm to position the writer over the data fields is not required according to the second method since the data fields are already prewritten at an offset, which is substantially equivalent to the reader-to-writer offset. However, just the opposite during a read operation, the actuator arm is required to perform a micro minijog to place the reader over the data field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> This reader-to-writer offset measurement is crucial since it will impact the disc drive performance against the track misregistration (TMR). TMR generally refers to position errors of the head between the target head position and the actual head position influenced by external disturbances such as disc flutter, runouts, disc vibrations, etc. The reader can read good data (i.e., data that contains no bit error or recoverable bit errors) only on small a portion of the track pitch (or width) of the track, and this portion of the track pitch is generally referred to as the off-track capability (OTC) of the head. For example, the OTC of a disc drive may only be about 10% of the track pitch. Thus, the reader or the writer must be positioned within the OTC (i.e., within the 10% of the track pitch) in order to successfully read information from or write data to the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> If the reader-to-writer offset measurement contains an error, one outcome is that the target head position may not be within the OTC of the head. The other outcome is that the target head position may not be located at the center of the OTC although it may be within the OTC of the head. In such a case, the target head position would still allow the reader to successfully read good data written on the track but would not provide optimal protection against the TMR. This is because the target head position would be located closer to one of the two edges of the OTC, and there exists higher probability that the external disturbance might displace the head outside the OTC of the head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The main technique that is currently used to determine the reader-to-writer offset is known as the bit-error-rate (BER) technique; however, this technique does not require that the target head position be located at the center of the OTC of the head. Accordingly, there is a need for determining an optimal reader-to-writer offset value that allows the target head position to be located at the center of the OTC of the head and provides better protection against TMR. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Against this backdrop, the present invention has been developed. The present invention essentially is a method of and an apparatus for generating an optimal reader-to-writer offset for a head positioned over a track on a disc in a disc drive having a plurality of tracks. A reader and a writer are mounted on the head in a non-overlapping manner with a gap between the reader and the writer, which is known as the reader-to-writer offset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A disc drive controller is operably connected to the reader and the writer. The disc drive controller determines the reader-to-writer offset of the head for each track by computing the difference between a first head position x1 and a second head position x2. The first head position x1 is an optimal head position for writing information on the track and the second head position x2 is a midpoint or a center of an off-track capability (OTC) of the head for a given track. The OTC is a portion of a track pitch over which the reader is expected to read information that is free of an incorrigible bit error such that the writer-to-reader track misregistration (TMR) is minimized as the head is radially displaced the reader-to-writer offset to read information written on the track or to write information on the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The head is optimally positioned for writing information on the track when the center of the writer is positioned over the center of the track pitch. Further, the information written on the track is deemed to be free of an incorrigible bit error if the bit-error-rate (BER) computed after reading the information over a plurality of disc revolutions is less than a predetermined threshold BER value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The second head position x2 is determined by measuring a first head position parameter P1 and a second head position parameter P2 and computing the midpoint between the first head position parameter P1 and the second head position parameter P2. The first head position parameter P1 and the second head position parameter P2 are the two end points of the OTC of the head. The first head position parameter P1 is the first head position nearest the first edge of the track pitch on which the BER is less than or equal to the minimum threshold BER value. The second head position parameter P2 is the second head position nearest the second edge of the track pitch on which position the BER is less than or equal to the minimum threshold BER value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The first head position parameter P1 is determined by positioning the reader over the first edge of the track pitch, measuring BER over a predetermined number of disc revolutions, and comparing the BER with the predetermined threshold BER value. If the BER is greater than the predetermined threshold BER value, the reader is displaced by a predetermined distance toward the center of the track pitch and the steps above are repeated until the BER is less than or equal to the predetermined threshold BER value. The head position on which the BER is less than or equal to the predetermined threshold BER value is then stored in a memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The second head position parameter P2 is determined by positioning the reader over the second edge of the track pitch, measuring BER over a predetermined number of disc revolutions, and comparing the BER with the predetermined threshold BER value. If the BER is greater than the predetermined threshold BER value, the reader is displaced by a predetermined distance toward the center of the track pitch and the steps above are repeated until the BER is less than or equal to the predetermined threshold BER value. The head position on which the BER is less than or equal to the predetermined threshold BER value is then stored in the memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> These and various other features as well as advantages that characterize the present invention will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to which various components of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are mounted. A top cover <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, shown partially cut away, cooperates with the base <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to form an internal, sealed environment for the disc drive in a conventional manner. The components include a spindle motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which rotates one or more discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at a constant high speed. Information is written to and read from tracks on the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> through the use of an actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which rotates during a seek operation about a bearing shaft assembly <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> positioned adjacent the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of actuator arms <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> which extend towards the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, with one or more flexures <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> extending from each of the actuator arms <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Mounted at the distal end of each of the flexures <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is a head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which includes an air bearing slider enabling the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to fly in close proximity above the corresponding surface of the associated disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> During a seek operation, the track position of the heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is controlled through the use of a voice coil motor (VCM) <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, which typically includes a coil <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> attached to the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as well as one or more permanent magnets <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> which establish a magnetic field in which the coil <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is immersed. The controlled application of current to the coil <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> causes magnetic interaction between the permanent magnets <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the coil <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> so that the coil <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> moves in accordance with the well-known Lorentz relationship. As the coil <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> moves, the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> pivots about the bearing shaft assembly <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and the heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are caused to move across the surfaces of the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The spindle motor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is typically de-energized when the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is not in use for extended periods of time. The heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are moved over park zones <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> near the inner diameter of the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> when the drive motor is de-energized. The heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are secured over the park zones <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through the use of an actuator latch arrangement, which prevents inadvertent rotation of the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> when the heads are parked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A flex assembly <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provides the requisite electrical connection paths for the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> while allowing pivotal movement of the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> during operation. The flex assembly includes a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to which head wires (not shown) are connected; the head wires being routed along the actuator arms <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the flexures <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to the heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> typically includes circuitry for controlling the write currents applied to the heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> during a write operation and a preamplifier for amplifying read signals generated by the heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> during a read operation. The flex assembly terminates at a flex bracket <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> for communication through the base deck <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to a disc drive printed circuit board (not shown) mounted to the bottom side of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, shown therein is a functional block diagram of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, generally showing the main functional circuits that are resident on the disc drive printed circuit board and used to control the operation of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A controller <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> generally provides top-level communication between the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that is operably connected to the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and also provides control of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with the ability to execute programs stored in a memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and/or a firmware <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. A set of registers <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is included in the controller <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The register <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is one of a small set of data holding places that are part of the controller and that provides a place for passing data from one instruction to the next sequential instruction or to another program that the controller <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> has given control to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> may be a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), or other sources of resident memory for the controller <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> may include spaces for general data store and/or store of programming modules. Each programming module stores computer readable instructions that are typically executable by the controller <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The programming modules may be stored in the firmware <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> rather than in the memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. A set of programming instructions may be stored in the firmware <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> by the host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> via a disc drive interface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Generally, the programming instructions in the firmware <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can be distributed like other software modules and can be created and tested by utilizing microcode simulation. The firmware <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is often a key component of the disc drive operation, because it contains generally the software program for disc drive operations that could operate independently from the control of the host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are rotated at a constant high speed by a spindle control circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, which typically electrically commutates the spindle motor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) through the use of back electromotive force (BEMF) sensing. During a seek operation, the track position of the heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is controlled through the application of current to the coil <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A servo control circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> provides such control. During a seek operation, the controller <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> receives information regarding the velocity and acceleration of the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and uses that information in conjunction with a model, stored in the memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, to communicate with the servo control circuit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which will apply a controlled amount of current to the voice coil motor <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be pivoted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Data is transferred between the host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by way of the disc drive interface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, which typically includes a buffer to facilitate high speed data transfer between the host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Data to be written to the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are thus passed from the host computer to the disc drive interface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and then to a read/write channel <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, which encodes and serializes the data and provides the requisite write current signals to the heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. To retrieve data that has been previously stored by the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, read signals are generated by the heads <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and provided to the read/write channel <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, which performs decoding and error detection and correction operations and outputs the retrieved data to the interface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> for subsequent transfer to the host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Generally, the disc drive interface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> includes hardware and/or software that regulates transmission of data and manages the exchange of data between the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. This disc drive interface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is contained in the electronics of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A standard committee such as American National Standard Institute (ANSI) oversees the adoption of an interface protocol by which any peripheral device following the common standard can be used interchangeably. Programming of the firmware <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> follows the disc drive interface protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> There are various types of disc drive interface standards such as Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI), FibreChannel-Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL), Serial Storage Architecture (SSA), Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA), Integrated Device Electronics (IDE), CompactFlash, etc. In an embodiment of the present invention, the ATA interface standard is used as an interface between the host computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. However, it is well known to those skilled in the art that the same scope and spirit disclosed in an embodiment of the present invention can also be applied to other types of disc drive interfaces listed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A typical disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is basically manufactured by a process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The disc drive components are first assembled in the manufacturing process in operation <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Then the servo information that defines tracks is written on the discs <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a servowriter in operation <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the disc drive controller conducts a self-test certification process in operation <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to determine whether or not the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a good or bad drive and to record operational parameters on the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> if the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is determined to be a good drive. For example, the entire data storage area of each disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be scanned in the self-test certification process <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to detect micro defects in sectors. If the total number of identified micro defects is more than the predetermined threshold, the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be determined as a bad drive in process <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if the total number of identified defects is less than the predetermined threshold, the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be determined as a good drive. All of the identified defective sector addresses are then stored in a set of sectors on the reference tracks that are not accessed by a user during normal operations. During each subsequent power-up of the disc drive, the operational parameters stored on the reference tracks of the disc are recalled to the memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> for use during normal disc drive operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A head offset table <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is one such area for storing operational parameters on the reference track for storing one type of disc drive operational parameter known as a reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>). The head offset table <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> stores the reader-to-writer offset values for the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> for each track. Typically, the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is measured on the first track of each zone. There are typically thirteen zones on the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, but the number of zones on the disc is a matter of design choice. Typically, the reader-to-writer offset values corresponding to only the first tracks in the zones are stored in the head offset table <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. During the power-up of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, these reader-to-writer offset values are transferred to the memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> for use during normal operations of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The tracks that are in between the two first tracks of two consecutive zones are interpolated, and this interpolation process is described in the latter part of this specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is described in more detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Note that the series of the elements shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are grossly exaggerated (not drawn to scale) and drawn for an illustration purpose only. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a generalized diagrammatic illustration of a portion of the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> mounted at the distal end of the actuator arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> includes a read element (or a reader) <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a write element (or a writer) <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has a width (referenced at <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>) and is centered along its width about centerline <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. The writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> also has a width (referenced at <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>) and is centered along its width about centerline <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The gap measured between the two centerlines <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> when these two centerlines <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> run in parallel with a line that is tangential to a track is known as the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The gap (the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>) is variable depending on the skew angle of the actuator arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and this aspect of varying reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is further illustrated with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a separate reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> mounted on the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that is mounted at the distal end of the rotary actuator arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which pivots about the bearing shaft assembly <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A gap <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> along the longitudinal axis of the actuator assembly arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> exists between the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The head skew angle, which is the angle between a tangential line to a track and the line drawn along the longitudinal axis of the actuator arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, changes as the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> moves from the inner diameter to the outer diameter of the disc, and vice versa. The combination of the gap <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and the varying head skew angle causes the radial distance defined by the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> between the path of the reader <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> (or the centerline <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>) and the path of the writer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> (or the centerline <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>) to vary as the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> moves from the inner diameter to the outer diameter of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an enlarged view the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> on the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> over a track <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> that is recorded with a signal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> (e.g., grey code, servo burst pattern, general data, etc.). The writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is centered at the offset count position of 0. The width of the track <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, also known as the track pitch, is defined by a range of offset counts that spans from &plus;128 to &minus;128, and the center of the track pitch is located at the offset count position 0. Although the offset count length of 1 is defined as {fraction (1/256)} of the track length in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the size of one offset count length is a matter of design choice, and the track pitch can be subdivided into even smaller units of offset count for finer positioning control of the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> over the track <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The center of the signal at the offset count position of 0 aligns with the writer centerline <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. At this offset count position of 0, the signal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> passes directly underneath the center of the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. However, the center of the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (or the reader centerline <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>) is not positioned over the center of the signal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The reader centerline <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is positioned away from the center of the signal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> (which coincides with the writer centerline <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>) by the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> therefore has to be displaced by the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in order to read the signal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> written by the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As previously discussed, the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> for a track varies from one track to another track since the head skew angle varies as the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> traverses from inner diameter to outer diameter of the disc, and vice versa. Thus, each track has a different reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> value. The reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> value for each track on the disc therefore has to be determined so that the controller <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> can position the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> over the track for accurate reading of the signal on the track in a manner that produces the least amount of error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The bit-error-rate (BER) technique is one approach used for determining the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. BER is defined as the relationship between the number of bits read incorrectly by the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the total number of bits read by the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and it is represented by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>BER</italic></highlight>&equals;(the number of bits read in error)/(the total number of bits read). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> BER is usually specified as a number times 10 raised to a negative exponent. Intuitively, the lowest BER would be measured at the center of the track <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> (i.e., the offset count position 0) since the data is theoretically targeted to be written at the track center. BER would increase as the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> moves away from the offset count position 0 toward either the inner diameter or the outer diameter of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is determined by measuring a first head position (x1) when the center of the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is aligned with the center of the signal <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> on the track <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Then, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> beginning at the offset count position &plus;128 traverses across the track while monitoring BER moving toward the offset count position 0 and then toward the offset count position &minus;128. The second head position (x2) is then recorded when BER is the lowest. Theoretically, the second head position (x2) is located at the track center (i.e., the offset count position 0), but this is not necessarily true in a typical disc drive. The reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is determined by taking the difference between x1 and x2 (i.e., &verbar;x1&minus;x2&verbar;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a BER profile <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> (i.e., a series of BER values measured across the track pitch or the track width) of a typical track such as the track <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The track pitch according to the present invention (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) is 256 offset counts wide, and the length of one offset count is therefore equivalent to {fraction (1/256)} of the track pitch. However, for illustration purposes here, the BER profile <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> is shown with respect to the offset count positions ranging from &minus;70 to &plus;70 although the full track pitch in this example is 256 offset counts wide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> To determine the BER profile <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> across the track pitch, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is first positioned over one end of the track width (e.g., the offset count position &minus;128 as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). The reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> then reads the recorded data on the track over a predetermined number of disc revolutions and monitors the BER. In an illustrative embodiment, the BER at this offset count position is then computed. The reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is then displaced by a short distance toward the center of the track (e.g., the offset count position &minus;120). Thereafter, the reader <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> again reads the data on the track over a predetermined number of disc revolutions, and the BER at this new offset count position is computed. This process repeats until the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> traverses across the entire track pitch, ending at the other end of the track width (e.g., the offset count position &plus;128 as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). The offset count position that produces the lowest BER is then selected as the second head position (x2), which is typically at or near the midpoint of the track width (i.e., the offset count position 0). According to the BER profile <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, the lowest BER is at the offset count position &plus;8 (referenced at <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>), and this then becomes the second head position (x2) of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In order for the data read by the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to be good data to a user, BER measured at a particular offset count position must be lower than a minimum BER threshold value <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The minimum BER threshold value <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> of the present invention is defined as 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>or &minus;5 in the log scale (i.e., &minus;5&equals;log<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>(10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>)). This means that data that contains more than one bit of error out of ten thousand bits of information read is unrecoverable bad data. The BER profile <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> indicates that the BERs measured at any offset count position in the range of offset count positions from &minus;58 to &plus;38 are lower than the minimum BER threshold value. Thus, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is expected to read good data whenever the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is positioned at any one of these offset count positions, from &minus;58 to &plus;38. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> This range of offset count positions (i.e., &minus;58 to &plus;38) that allows successful reading of data on the track is also referred to as an off-track capability (OTC) of the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is said to have better OTC on a particular track if the range of offset count positions that allows successful reading of data on the track is greater than on another track that has smaller range of offset count positions. How wide or narrow is this range of offset count positions or OTC signifies the ability of the disc drive system to handle track misregistration (TMR) without exceeding the minimum BER threshold value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As described above, the head position (x2) is determined at the offset count position where BER is the lowest in order to compute the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (i.e., &verbar;x1&minus;x2&verbar;). The BER profile <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> indicates that the lowest BER is present at the offset count position &plus;8 (referenced at <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>). Thus, for example, if x1 were at the offset count position &plus;100, then the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> would be 92 (i.e., &verbar;100&minus;8&verbar;). This reader-to-writer offset value is then recorded and later utilized by the controller <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to position the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to read data written on the track after writing data using the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> However, the lowest BER offset count position (x2) <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is not at the midpoint of the OTC (i.e., the range of the offset count positions that allows a successful reading of data on the track). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the portion of the OTC, (OTC_OD_OLD) <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, that is on the left side of (x2) <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> (near the outside diameter of the disc) is wider than the portion of the OTC, (OTC_ID_OLD) <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> that is on the right side of (x2) <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> (near the inside diameter of the disc). Theoretically, however, the OTC profile (as shown in <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>) should be symmetrical with respect to the lowest BER offset count position (x2) <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. Nevertheless, this OTC profile symmetry is impossible to achieve due to variations that are inevitably introduced to the disc drive during the manufacturing stage. For example, there may be some manufacturing variations that produce stronger write-field on one side of the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> (e.g., the side near the outside diameter of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) than on the other side of the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> (e.g., the side near the inside diameter of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). In addition, there may be some manufacturing variations that produce greater read-sensitivity on one side of the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (e.g., the side near the outside diameter of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) than on the other side of the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (e.g., the side near the inside diameter of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). Further, variations of the skew angle of the actuator arm <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> when placing the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> on the track may contribute to uneven symmetry of the OTC profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The uneven symmetry of the OTC profile generally means that the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is more sensitive to the outside disturbances that cause TMR. The fact that the OTC_ID_OLD <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is not as wide as the OTC_OD_OLD <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> as shown by the BER profile <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> indicates that the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is more susceptible to the external disturbances that can displace the head toward the inside diameter. Thus, an external disturbance that can displace the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> toward the inside diameter of the disc by a distance that is greater than the OTC_ID_OLD <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> will cause a read error due to TMR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> There are various types of external disturbances adversely affecting accurate positioning of the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> on the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Negative effects such as disc flutter, disc runouts, and/or external shock/vibration can cause the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to be mispositioned away from the intended offset count position on the track and produce TMR. There are two types of TMR: a writer-to-writer TMR and a writer-to-reader TMR. The writer-to-writer TMR deals with mispositioning of the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> as it seeks to an adjacent track from a recorded track. The writer-to-writer TMR typically affects the spacing between two adjacent tracks, and this is also generally known as the track squeeze. The present invention, however, is directed to more effective handling of the effects of the writer-to-reader TMR. The writer-to-reader TMR deals with mispositioning of the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (or alternatively, the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>) as it moves over to its intended offset count position of the track pitch from the previous head position at which the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> (or alternatively, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) was positioned over the same track. For example, in order to write data in a data sector on a track, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has to first read, inter alia, the grey code information that identifies the data sector. Once the data sector is identified as the correct data sector by the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> would then write data in the data sector. Therefore, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> must be displaced by the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in order to position itself over the intended offset count position of the track pitch whenever the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> sequentially reads information from and write information to sectors that are on the same track. If the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> misses the intended offset count position on the track, this displacement error is referred to as the writer-to-reader TMR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> One of the major components that cause the writer-to-reader TMR in a disc drive is non-repeatable runout (NRRO) that is generated largely due to vibrations from the spindle motor assembly. NRRO as implied by its name is not repeatable (i.e., the disturbance does not repeat at the same circumferential position on the track) but rather occurs in a random manner at difference locations of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. If, for example, the OTC (i.e., the total range of offset counts where the BERs are above the minimum threshold BER value) of a disc drive is about 10% of the track pitch, the writer-to-reader TMR must be controlled within 10% of the track pitch. That is, the combined effect from each of the external disturbances that contributes to the writer-to-reader TMR should not displace the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> or the writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> on the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> outside the OTC of the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which is about 10% of the track pitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Empirically it can be shown that the writer-to-reader TMR can be controlled within about 10% of the track pitch (i.e., about 26 offset counts) if NRRO that can displace about 5% of the track pitch is present in the disc drive. This also means that in order to control the writer-to-reader TMR within 10% of the track pitch, the NRRO that contributes to the writer-to-reader TMR must be controlled within 5% of the track pitch. This relationship between the percentage of a track pitch required for controlling the writer-to-reader TMR (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;) and the percentage of the track pitch that is affected by the external disturbances including NRRO (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;TP<highlight><subscript>OTHERS</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; for the displacement due to other disturbances and &ldquo;TP<highlight><subscript>NRRO</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; for the displacement due to NRRO) is shown by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>TP</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>WRTMR</subscript></highlight>&equals;&lsqb;2*(<highlight><italic>TP</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>NRRO</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;(<highlight><italic>TP</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>OTHERS</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In general, TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR </subscript></highlight>should be less than the width of the OTC. For example, TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR </subscript></highlight>by applying the above equation would increase to 14.6% of the track pitch if TP<highlight><subscript>NRRO </subscript></highlight>was 9% of the track pitch instead of 5% of the track pitch. In other words, the writer-to-reader TMR needs to be controlled within 14.6% of the track pitch. This would then require the OTC of more than 14.6% of the track pitch, and there would be a serious writer-to-reader TMR problem if the OTC of the disc drive remained as 10% of the track pitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR </subscript></highlight>is also affected if the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (i.e., &verbar;x1&minus;x2&verbar;) is not computed correctly or optimally. Incorrect determination of x2 would introduce an error to the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> measurement. For example, the OTC of 10% of the track pitch would be reduced to 9% if there were an error of 1% of the track pitch in the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> measurement. This means that the reader-to-writer TMR has to be controlled within 9% of the track pitch (i.e., TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR </subscript></highlight>9%) instead of the 10% of the track pitch. This also means that TMR caused due to NRRO has to be controlled within 3.9% of the track pitch (i.e., TP<highlight><subscript>NRRO</subscript></highlight>&equals;3.9%) if the displacement due to TMR caused by other disturbances (i.e., TP<highlight><subscript>OTHERS</subscript></highlight>) remains the same. For example, TP<highlight><subscript>OTHERS </subscript></highlight>can be computed to be 7.07% of the track pitch for TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR </subscript></highlight>of 10% of the track pitch and for TP<highlight><subscript>NRRO </subscript></highlight>of 5% of the track pitch. Then, TP<highlight><subscript>NRRO </subscript></highlight>of 3.9% can be computed by applying TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR </subscript></highlight>of 9% and TP<highlight><subscript>OTHER </subscript></highlight>of 7.07% to the equation (i.e., <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> &lsqb;2*(TP<highlight><subscript>NRRO</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;(7.07)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thus, incorrect or non-optimal measurement of the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> would require the disc drives to be manufactured with a stricter tolerance requirement in order to minimize the effects of NRRO and other external disturbances on the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. As shown above, 1% of the track pitch error in the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> measurement would reduce TP<highlight><subscript>NRRO </subscript></highlight>by 1.1% of the track pitch (i.e., from 5% to 3.9% of the track pitch). The complexity of the servo and mechanical subsystem in the disc drive then would have to be greatly increased in order to accomplish this stricter tolerance requirement. It would lead to significant manufacturing cost increase and be a serious burden on high-density disc drive manufacturing process. Therefore, the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> needs to be determined an optimal value that would not diminish TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR </subscript></highlight>and free from any computational error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the offset count position at which position BER was the lowest (referenced at <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>) was selected as x2. However, this selection of (x2) <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> cannot be considered as an optimally selected position that does not diminish TP<highlight><subscript>WRTMR</subscript></highlight>, because (x2) <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is not at the midpoint of the OTC. The uneven symmetry of the OTC profile with respect to (x2) <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> indicates that the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is more sensitive to the outside disturbances that cause TMR. The reader-to-writer track TMR can be optimized if x2 is selected instead at the midpoint of the OTC, that is, the offset count position &minus;10 (referenced at <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>). By selecting x2 at the midpoint <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> of the OTC, OTC_OD_NEW equals OTC_ID_NEW. The head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can better withstand the disturbance that causes the head to move toward the inside diameter direction. For example, the OTC of the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is 96 offset counts However, OTC_ID_OLD <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> (i.e., 30 offset counts) is less than OTC_OD_OLD <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> (i.e., 66 offset counts) due to uneven symmetry. The fact that the OTC_ID_OLD <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is not as wide as the OTC_OD_OLD <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> as shown by the BER profile <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> indicates that the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is more sensitive to the external disturbances that can displace the head toward the inside diameter. By selecting x2 at the midpoint of the OTC profile at the offset count position &minus;10 (referenced at <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>), OTC_ID_NEW <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and OTC_OD_NEW <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> both equal to 48 offset counts. OTC_ID_NEW <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> is wider than OTC_ID_OLD <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> by 18 offset counts. This 18 offset counts provide additional room for the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to control writer-to-reader TMR in the direction toward inner diameter of the disc <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Thus, the selection of the midpoint of the OTC (referenced at <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>) as x2 as opposed to the lowest BER offset count position (referenced at <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>) yields the optimal reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (i.e., &verbar;x2&minus;x1&verbar;) value that provides more optimal protection against writer-to-reader TMR. In addition, the implementation of the present invention reduces the BER test time and can therefore improve the manufacturing yield of the disc drives. That is, the present invention does not require determination of the offset count position that provides the lowest BER value. In order to measure the lowest BER value, the BER test must be performed across the entire track pitch. To the contrary, the present invention requires measurement of BER at only the two boundary positions of the OTC profile (i.e., the offset count positions &minus;58 and &plus;38). The midpoint <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> can then be computed by knowing the two boundary positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together comprise a flowchart for determining the optimal reader-to-writer offset for a track in each zone according to an embodiment of the present invention. Typically, thirteen zones are present on the disc, but the optimal reader-to-writer offset is determined on only the first track of each zone. The reader-to-writer offset values for other tracks in each zone are interpolated by utilizing the optimal reader-to-writer offset values determined from the first tracks of the zones. The interpolation technique is described in detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the technique for determining a reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> begins in operation <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> by moving the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> over the first zone on the disc. Control then transfers to operation <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, in which operation the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is moved over to the target track, which in this example is the first track in the zone. The writer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is moved over the center of the track, and the head position (x1) is then determined. Thereafter, control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>, and any data written on the target track, a set of three tracks that is adjacent the target track toward the inner diameter of the disc, and another set of three tracks that is adjacent the target track toward the outer diameter of the disc (i.e., a total of seven tracks) is erased. The reason for erasing six additional tracks in addition to erasing the target track is that the length of the reader-to-writer offset may be more than a track pitch wide. This is typically the case for the high-density disc drives. The control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, and the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is moved over the target track and writes the track with data that is typically servo pattern. Operation <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> receives control and moves the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> a predetermined number of reader-to-writer offsets (e.g., about three reader-to-writer offsets) toward the outer diameter of the disc away from the center of the target track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. In this operation, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> reads the data over a predetermined number of disc revolutions. The predetermined number of disc revolutions allows the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to collect sufficient information to compute the BER at this head position. Control transfers to query operation <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>, which examines the presence of a synchronization mark error. If the error is present, the operation branches to <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, in which operation, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is displaced by a predetermined coarse offset toward the inner diameter of the disc (i.e., toward the center of the target track). Operations <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> are repeated until the error is not present. If the error is not present, the operation branches to <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> (now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) and determines the BER. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Control then transfers to query operation <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> once the BER is determined. The determined BER is then compared with the minimum threshold BER value to determine whether the determined BER exceeds the minimum threshold BER value. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the minimum threshold BER value was predetermined to be 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>. Thus, control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> if the computed BER is greater than the minimum threshold BER value of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>. Alternatively, control branches to operation <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> if the computed BER is less than or equal to the minimum threshold value of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As described above, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> reads good data at an offset count position at which position the BER value is less than the minimum threshold BER value. In operation <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> then steps toward the inner diameter of the disc (i.e., toward the center of the track) by a predetermined number of offset counts. Thereafter, operations <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> are repeatedly performed until the computed BER is less than or equal to the minimum threshold BER value. If the computed BER is determined to be less than the minimum threshold BER value in operation <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, this means that the first one of the two OTC boundary positions of the track pitch is determined. Control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, and the head position at this second OTC boundary position (P1) is determined and saved in the memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. For example, the offset count position of &minus;58 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is the OTC boundary position (P1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Control then transfers to operation <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. The head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is moved a predetermined number of reader-to-writer offsets (i.e., about three reader-to-writer offsets) toward the inner diameter of the disc away from the center of the target track. Control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. In this operation, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> reads the data over a predetermined number of disc revolutions. The predetermined number of disc revolutions allows the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to collect sufficient information to compute the BER at this head position. Control transfers to query operation <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>, which examines the presence of a synchronization mark error. If the error is present, the operation branches to <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>, in which operation, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is displaced by a predetermined coarse offset toward the outer diameter of the disc (i.e., toward the center of the target track). Operations <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> are repeated until the error is not present. If the error is not present, the operation branches to <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> (now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) and determines the BER. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Control then transfers to query operation <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> once the BER is computed. The computed BER is then compared with the minimum threshold BER value to determine whether the computed BER exceeds the minimum threshold BER value. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the minimum threshold BER value was predetermined to be 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>. Thus, control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> if the computed BER is greater than the minimum threshold BER value of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>. Alternatively, control branches to operation <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> if the computed BER is less than or equal to the minimum threshold value of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As described above, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> reads good data at an offset count position at which position the BER value is less than the minimum threshold BER value. In operation <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, the reader <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> then steps toward the outer diameter of the disc (i.e, toward the center of the track) by a predetermined number of offset counts. Thereafter, operations <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> are repeatedly performed until the computed BER is less than or equal to the minimum threshold BER value. If the computed BER is determined to be less than the minimum threshold BER value in operation <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, this means that the second one of the two OTC boundary positions of the track pitch is determined. Control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>, and the head position at this second OTC boundary position (P2) is determined and saved in the memory <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. For example, the offset count position of &minus;38 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is the second OTC boundary position (P2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Control then transfers to operation <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, where the midpoint (x2) between the first and second OTC boundary positions P1 and P2 is determined. For example, the offset count position &minus;10 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (referenced at <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>) is an exemplary midpoint of the OTC profile (x2). Control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>, and the optimal reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> for the first track in the first zone on the disc is then computed by taking the difference between x1 and x2. Control transfers to query operation <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, and control ends if the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is over the last zone on the disc. If, however, the head <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is not over the last zone on the disc, control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>, and the head is moved over to the next zone. Control transfers to operation <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, and operations <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight> are repeated until the optimal reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is determined for the first track in every zone on the disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The data area on the disc is typically divided into thirteen zones, although this number is variable depending on the design choice. During measurement process, the reader-to-writer offset <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> was measured on only the first track of each zone. For other tracks, the reader-to-writer offset values are interpolated. For example, a third-order polynomial may be used to interpolate the offset for each track in between the two first tracks of two consecutive zones. For example, suppose there are 1000 tracks in each zone. Then, the optimal reader-to-writer offset 410 values are measured for tracks <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4000</bold></highlight> . . . <highlight><bold>13000</bold></highlight>, and a series of equations can be generated from these 13 points: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The coefficients &lsqb;a3, a2, a1, a0&rsqb; are solved by using the least square method. Then the offset for any track can be accurately estimated based on the coefficients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In summary, the present invention may be viewed as a method of and an apparatus for generating a reader-to-writer offset (such as <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>) for a head (such as <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>) positioned over a track (such as <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>) on a disc (such as <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) in a disc drive (such as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) having a plurality of tracks. A reader (such as <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) and a writer (such as <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>) are mounted on the head in a non-overlapping manner with a gap between the reader and the writer, which is known as the reader-to-writer offset (such as FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A disc drive controller (such as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is operably connected to the reader and the writer. The disc drive controller determines the reader-to-writer offset of the head for each track by computing the difference between a first head position x1 and a second head position x2 (such as operation <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The first head position x1 (such as <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>) is an optimal head position for writing information on the track (such as <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>) and the second head position x2 (such as <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>) is a midpoint of an off-track capability (OTC) of the head (such as <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>). The OTC (such as <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>) is a portion of a track pitch over which the reader is expected to read information that is free of an incorrigible bit error such that the writer-to-reader track misregistration (TMR) is minimized as the head is radially displaced by the reader-to-writer offset to read information written on the track or to write information on the track (such as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
