<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a nonvolatile memory cell. The present invention uses tungsten (W) as an upper layer of a control gate electrode in order to integrate the memory cell and performs an ion implantation process for forming a source region and a drain region before a selective oxidization process that is performed to prevent abnormal oxidization of tungsten (W). Therefore, the present invention can reduce a RC delay time of word lines depending on integration of the memory cell and also secure a given distance between a silicon substrate and a tunnel oxide film. As a result, the present invention can solve a data retention problem of the flash memory. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to a method of manufacturing a nonvolatile memory cell, and more particularly to, a method of manufacturing a nonvolatile memory cell capable of enhancing a retention characteristic of the nonvolatile memory using selective oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2Description of the Prior Art: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor memory device can be classified into RAM (random access memory) products such as DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and SRAM (static random access memory), and ROM (read only memory). RAM is volatile since the data in RAM is lost in time but ROM is nonvolatile since the data in ROM is not lost. Also, the input/output speed of data in RAM is fast but the input/output speed of data in ROM is low. This ROM product family may include ROM, PROM (programmable ROM), EPROM (erasable programmable ROM) and EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory). Among them, a demand for EEPROM from which data is electrically programmable and erasable has been increased. The EEPROM or a flash EEPROM has a stack type gate structure in which a floating gate electrode and a control gate electrode are stacked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The memory cell of the stack type gate structure programs/erases data by means of Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling and has a tunnel oxide film, a floating gate electrode, a dielectric film and a control gate electrode stacked on a semiconductor substrate. The gate electrodes have a stack structure in which a polysilicon layer into which an impurity having a strong heat-resistance is doped or a polysilicon layer and a tungsten silicide (WSix) are stacked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, after the gate electrodes are formed, a high temperature annealing process for compensating for etching damage generated when a pattern of the gate electrode is formed is performed. At this time, however, there occurs a GGO (graded gate oxide) phenomenon in which a silicon substrate at an edge portion of the tunnel oxide film is oxidized/grown due to the annealing process. The GGO phenomenon is generated between the floating gate electrode and the semiconductor substrate to keep them by a given distance, thus solving a retention problem that is most important in the nonvolatile memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There was proposed &ldquo;In-situ barrier formation for high reliable W/barrier/poly-Si gate using denudation of WNx on polycrystalline Si, LG, SEMICONDUCTOR CO. LTD., issued by Byung-Hak Lee etc. (IEEE, 1998). This paper proposes a resistance variation ratio to the width of the gate electrode formed of tungsten silicide (WSix) or tungsten (W). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Seeing a characteristic graph relating to the resistance variation ratio to the width of the gate electrode shown in this paper, if the width of the gate electrode is reduced to below 0.2 &mgr;m, the resistance of the gate electrode formed of tungsten silicide (WSix) is abruptly increased while the resistance of the gate electrode formed of tungsten (W) is almost constant with no regard to reduced width. In other words, as the wired of the gate electrode formed of tungsten silicide (WSix) is reduced to below 0.2 &mgr;m, the resistance is abruptly increased while the resistance of the gate electrode formed of tungsten (W) is almost constant with no regard to reduced width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when the gate electrode is formed of tungsten silicide (WSix), there is a problem that a RC delay time is delayed since the resistance is increased as the memory cell is higher integrated. Due to this, there is a need for a method for forming a gate electrode using tungsten (W) in order to implement higher integrated memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, tungsten (W) is abnormally oxidized since it easily reacts with oxygen at a high temperature. Therefore, there occurs a problem that an upper surface characteristic of the gate electrode is degraded since tungsten (W) is abnormally oxidized at a high temperature annealing process. Recently, in order to solve this problem, there has been proposed a selective oxidation process instead of the high temperature annealing process. Though the selective oxidation process can prevent abnormal oxidization of tungsten (W), it does not sufficiently oxidize the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate at an edge portion of the tunnel oxide film. Thus, there is a problem that it does not solve a retention problem of the nonvolatile memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a method capable of solving a retention problem in a nonvolatile memory cell when a gate electrode is formed using tungsten (W). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a nonvolatile memory cell capable of solving a high temperature annealing problem occurring when a gate electrode is used, in a way that the gate electrode is formed using tungsten (W) in order to implement integration of the nonvolatile memory cell. </paragraph>

A floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is positioned in each of the memory cell MC and is electrically floated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided and a device isolation film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for separating active regions and a plurality of device isolation regions for separating the active regions is formed in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed in the active region. A tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a dielectric film (ONO) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a control gate electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and a hard mask layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are sequentially stacked on the active region in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. At this time, the first polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed and is then etched to form the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The control gate electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a stack structure in which the second polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as an lower layer and the tungsten nitride film (WN)/tungsten (W) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as an upper layer are stacked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Generally, in a NOR type flash memory, bit lines (not shown) being a common line of the plurality of the memory cells MC are connected to the drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the memory cell MC and the source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being a diffusion layer line is formed in parallel to the direction along which the control gate electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> extends. At this time, the diffusion layer line functions as a common line (common source region) between the plurality of the memory cells MC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The major characteristics of the nonvolatile memory cell in the first embodiment lies in that it forms the control gate electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> having a stack structure of polysilicon <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and tungsten (W) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and forms an oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at an edge portion of the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in order to prevent a retention problem of the memory cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is prepared. A device isolation film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is selectively formed in a device isolation region for defining an active region in the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> By reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are sequentially formed on the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be formed by thermally oxidizing an exposed surface of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or by performing a deposition process. The first polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed by growing amorphous silicon (not shown) not doped on the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and then implanting/annealing arsenic (or phosphorous, boron) ions on the amorphous silicon. At this time, an oxide film is formed on the amorphous silicon in order to control the depth of ion implantation to a given range. The oxide film after the ion implantation process is removed by etching solution (for example, HF solution). At this time, the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be formed by annealing amorphous silicon to form polysilicon and then accumulating/annealing PSG (phosphosilicate glass), BSG (borosilicate glass), and the like on it to diffuse phosphorous or boron contained in the PSG or BSG, and the line into polysilicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the device isolation region in which the device isolation film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed are patterned by a common photolithography and given etching method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> By reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, an upper surface of the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is thermally oxidized to grow a first oxide film on the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Then, a silicon nitride film is stacked by means of LPCVD method and a second oxide film (called HTO film) is then stacked on the silicon nitride film by means of LPCVD method, thus forming a dielectric film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of a three-layer structure (ONO structure). At this time, the first oxide film may be formed of HTO. At the same, in case that the first oxide film is formed by oxidizing the first polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a dry oxidization method is used in order for the first oxide film to have a good control property. Further, the dielectric film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be formed with a single layer insulating film formed of a thermal oxide film instead of the ONO insulating film. Thereafter, a second polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a tungsten nitride film (WN)/tungsten (W) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a hard mask layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to be used as a mask upon a self align etch (SAE) process are sequentially formed on the dielectric film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, a photoresist reacting with light is deposited on the entire structure. Then, a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, that is pattern in a given shape by means of exposure process using the photomask, is formed. Thereafter, the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the tungsten nitride film (WN)/tungsten (W) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the dielectric film <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are sequentially etched by means of etch process using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as a mask to form a control gate electrode <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Next, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is removed by means of given strip process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Then, by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the first polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are sequentially etched by means of self align etch (SAE) process to form a floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. At this time, regions of the active region where the source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be formed are etched by the etch process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a subsequent process of manufacturing the device isolation region is the same to the conventional process. Thus, a detailed description on the process of manufacturing the device isolation region will be omitted and only the active region will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are formed in the active region by means of source/drain ion implantation process using source/drain ion implantation mask. The source/drain ion implantation process may be performed in a single step using an ion implantation energy of about 5Kev&tilde;30keV or of about 15KeV&tilde;45KeV or may be performed in two steps using an ion implantation energy of about 5KeV&tilde;30keV is performed and then an ion implantation energy of about 15KeV&tilde;45KeV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed on both sidewalls of the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and on the source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of selective oxidization process. At this time, the selective oxidization process uses a hydrogen gas in order to prevent abnormal oxidization of the tungsten nitride film (WN)/tungsten (W) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Also, the selective oxidization process may be performed once again before the ion implantation process for forming the source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> By reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, an insulating film for a gate spacer is formed on the entire surface. Then, spacers <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed on both sides of the gate electrodes by means of etch process. By means of the etch process, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is etched in one direction to the spacer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to expose given portions of the source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the selective oxidization process is performed under the same process to a common selective oxidization process (for example, a process time of about 2&tilde;7 minutes). Even with this oxidization process, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed in thickness of about 50 &angst;&tilde;400 &angst;. This thickness is much thicker than that of the oxide film formed under the same conventional selective oxidization process (for example, about 20 &angst;&tilde;50 &angst;). The reason why the thickness of the oxide film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment of the present invention is much thicker than that formed under the same conventional selective oxidization process is that the ion implantation process for forming the source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is performed before the selective oxidization process. In other words, this is because that a region of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into which impurity is implanted, for example, the source region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are much faster oxidized than a region of the semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into which impurity is not implanted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The nonvolatile memory cell according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be below described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A structure of the memory cell according to the second embodiment of the present invention is almost same to the structure of the memory cell shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Only difference lies in that the second embodiment performs a first selective oxidization process to form a first oxide layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the sides of a second polysilicon <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a dielectric film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> both of which are over-etched by blanket etch process, before a floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the memory cell MC is patterned, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Also, the second embodiment of the present invention secures an effective channel length margin of the memory cell by forming the width of the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>wider than the width of the control gate electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are cross-sectional views for explaining a process of manufacturing of the flash memory cell according to the second embodiment of the present invention, which show cross-sectional views taken along lines &lsquo;X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&rsquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this paragraph, the active region only will be explained. As the step of forming the hard mask layer is same to the first embodiment, the explanation thereof will be omitted and subsequent processes thereof will be explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> photoresist is formed on the entire structure. Then, a photoresist pattern (not shown) is formed by exposure process using the photo mask. Thereafter, the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the tungsten nitride film (WN)/tungsten (W) <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the second polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the dielectric film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are etched in one direction by means of the etch process using the photoresist pattern, thus forming a control gate electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In this process, both sides of the second polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> being a lower layer in the control gate electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the dielectric film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are over-etched. This is because that the etch rat of the second polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the dielectric film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is higher than that of the tungsten nitride film (WN)/tungsten (W) <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> being an upper layer in the control gate electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> By reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the first selective oxidization process is performed to form a first oxide layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on both sides of the second over-etched polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the dielectric film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The first selective oxidization process is performed using hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, an insulating film for a control gate electrode spacer is formed on the entire surface. Then, the insulating film for a control gate electrode spacer is etched using etching process to form a first spacer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on both sides of the control gate electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Next, a self align etch (SAE) process is performed to sequentially etch the first polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the tunnel oxide film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, thus forming a floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In this process, as the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is experienced by self align etch (SAE) process using the first spacer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as a mask, the width of the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed to be wider than that of the control gate electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, so that an effective channel length margin of the memory cells can be secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> By reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, source/drain ion implantation process using a source/drain ion implantation mask is performed to form a source region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a drain region <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the active region. The source/drain ion implantation process may be performed in a single step using an ion implantation energy of about 5Kev&tilde;30keV or of about 15KeV&tilde;45KeV or may be performed in two steps using an ion implantation energy of about 5KeV&tilde;30keV is performed and then an ion implantation energy of about 15KeV&tilde;45KeV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> second selective oxidization process is performed to a second oxide layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on both sides of the floating gate electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and on the source region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, an insulating film for a gate electrode spacer is formed on the entire structure. A second spacer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is formed on both sides of the gate electrodes by etch process. The second oxide layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is etched in one direction to the second spacer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to expose given portions of the source region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the drain region <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As can be understood from the above description, the present invention has an advantage that is can reduce a RC delay time of word lines depending on integration of the memory cell by forming a gate electrode using tungsten (W). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Also, as a control gate is pattern/formed and spacers are formed on both sides of the control gate, the present invention can prevent a lift of a dielectric film by a subsequent selective oxidization process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention forms a floating gate electrode using the spacer as a mask. Thus, the present invention can flexibly change the length of the floating gate electrode to obtain a channel length margin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention first performs a source/drain ion implantation process for forming source and drain region before the selective oxidization process in order to promote the speed of oxidization an edge portion of the tunnel oxide film. Therefore, a given distance between the semiconductor substrate and the tunnel oxide film can be secured to solve a data retention problem of the flash memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment in connection with a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings of the present invention will recognize additional modifications and applications within the scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
