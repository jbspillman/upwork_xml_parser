<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to well drilling operations and, more particularly, to a device for assisting in the assembly of pipe strings, such as casing strings, drill strings and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The drilling of oil wells involves assembling drill strings and casing strings, each of which comprises a plurality of elongated, heavy pipe segments extending downwardly from an oil drilling rig into a hole. The drill string consists of a number of sections of pipe which are threadedly engaged together, with the lowest segment (i.e., the one extending the furthest into the hole) carrying a drill bit at its lower end. Typically, the casing string is provided around the drill string to line the well bore after drilling the hole and ensure the integrity of the hole. The casing string also consists of a plurality of pipe segments which are threadedly coupled together and formed with through passages sized to receive the drill string and/or other pipe strings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The conventional manner in which plural casing segments are coupled together to form a casing string is a labor-intensive method involving the use of a &ldquo;stabber&rdquo; and casing tongs. The stabber is manually controlled to insert a segment of casing into the upper end of the existing casing string, and the tongs are designed to engage and rotate the segment to threadedly connect it to the casing string. While such a method is effective, it is cumbersome and relatively inefficient because the procedure is done manually. In addition, the casing tongs require a casing crew to properly engage the segment of casing and to couple the segment to the casing string. Thus, such a method is relatively labor-intensive and therefore costly. Furthermore, using casing tongs requires the setting up of scaffolding or other like structures, and is therefore inefficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Others have proposed a casing running tool for assembling casing strings which utilizes a conventional top drive assembly. The tool includes a pivotable manipulator which is designed to engage a pipe segment and raise the pipe segment up into a power assist spider, which relies on gravity to hold the pipe segment. The spider is coupled to the top drive and may be rotated by it. Thus, the pipe segment may be brought into contact with a casing string and the top drive activated to rotate the casing segment and threadedly engage it with the casing string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> While such a system provides benefits over the more conventional systems used to assemble casing strings, such a system suffers from shortcomings. One such shortcoming is that the casing segment may not be sufficiently engaged by the power assist spider to properly connect the casing segment with the casing string. In addition, the system fails to provide any means for effectively controlling the load applied to the threads at the bottom of the casing segment, as well as to the top of the casing string when the casing segment is lowered onto the string. Without the ability to control these loads, cross-threading may occur, resulting in stripped threads and a useless casing segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that there continues to be a need for a device for use in a drilling system which utilizes an existing top drive assembly to efficiently assemble casing and/or drill strings, and which positively engages a pipe segment to ensure proper coupling of the pipe segment to a pipe string. In addition, the need exists for a load compensator to compensate for both upwardly and downwardly directed loads that are applied to either the casing string or the casing segment. The present invention addresses these needs and others. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Briefly, and in general terms, the present invention is directed to a pipe running tool for use in drilling systems and the like to assemble casing and/or drill strings. The pipe running tool is coupled to an existing top drive assembly which is used to rotate a drill string, and includes a powered elevator that is powered into an engaged position to securely engage a pipe segment, for example, a casing segment. Because the elevator is powered into the engaged position, the pipe segment may be properly coupled to an existing pipe string using the top drive assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The system of the present invention in one illustrative embodiment is directed to a pipe running tool mountable on a rig and including: a top drive assembly adapted to be connected to the rig for vertical displacement of the top drive assembly relative to the rig, the top drive assembly including a drive shaft, the top drive assembly being operative to rotate the drive shaft; and a lower pipe engagement assembly including a central passageway sized for receipt of the pipe segment, the lower pipe engagement assembly including a powered engagement device that is powered to an engaged position to securely and releasably grasp the pipe segment, the lower pipe engagement assembly being in communication with the drive shaft, whereby actuation of the top drive assembly causes the lower pipe engagement assembly to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In still another illustrative embodiment, the system of the present invention is directed to a pipe running tool having a greater slip back offset such that drill pipe and drill pipe tool joints may be passed through the central passageway of the tool without interfering with the front of the slip. In such an embodiment, the pipe running tool may utilize a three-slip design capable of providing a larger central passageway and greater load bearing capability such that both casing and drill pipe may be backed-up using the pipe running tool alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In yet another illustrative embodiment, the system of the present invention is directed to a pipe running tool having slips further comprising detachable insert carriers attached thereto, the insert carriers being capable of being inserted onto the front of the slips such that the diameter of the central passageway can be quickly altered based on the dimension of the insert carrier allowing the running of different sized tubulars through the pipe running tool with a single slip set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In still yet another illustrative embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of assembling a pipe string, including the steps of: actuating a lower pipe engagement assembly to releasably engage a pipe segment; lowering a top drive assembly to bring the pipe segment into contact with a pipe string; monitoring the load on the pipe string; actuating a load compensator to raise the pipe segment a selected distance relative to the pipe string, if the load on the pipe string exceeds a predetermined threshold value; and actuating the top drive assembly to rotate the pipe segment to threadedly engage the pipe segment and pipe string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In still yet another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of running casing or drill pipe into a borehole utilizing the pipe running tool comprising, using the top drive to impart rotational and vertical motion to the casing or drill pipe through the pipe running tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the features of the present invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, like reference numerals will be used to refer to like or corresponding elements in the different figures of the drawings. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> depicting one illustrative embodiment of the present invention, which is designed for use in assembling pipe strings, such as drill strings, casing strings, and the like. The pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises, generally, a frame assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a lower pipe engagement assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is coupled to the rotatable shaft for rotation therewith. The pipe engagement assembly is designed for selective engagement of a pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A) to substantially prevent relative rotation between the pipe segment and the pipe engagement assembly. The rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is designed for coupling with a top drive output shaft from an existing top drive, such that the top drive, which is normally used to rotate a drill string to drill a well hole, may be used to assemble a pipe string, for example, a casing string or a drill string, as is described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is designed for use, for example, in a well drilling rig <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A suitable example of such a rig is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,401 to Boyadjieff, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the rig includes a frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a pair of guide rails <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along which a top drive assembly, generally designated <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, may ride for vertical movement relative to the rig. The top drive assembly is preferably a conventional top drive used to rotate a drill string to drill a well hole, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,605,077 to Boyadjieff, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. The top drive assembly includes a drive motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a top drive output shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from the drive motor, with the drive motor being operative to rotate the drive shaft, as is conventional in the art. The rig defines a drill floor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a central opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through which a drill string and/or casing string <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is extended downwardly into a well hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The rig <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also includes a flush-mounted spider <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is configured to releasably engage the drill string and/or casing string <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and support the weight thereof as it extends downwardly from the spider into the well hole. As is well known in the art, the spider includes a generally cylindrical housing which defines a central passageway through which the pipe string may pass. The spider includes a plurality of slips which are located within the housing and are selectively displaceable between disengaged and engaged positions, with the slips being driven radially inwardly to the respective engaged positions to tightly engage the pipe segment and thereby prevent relative movement or rotation of the pipe segment and the spider housing. The slips are preferably driven between the disengaged and engaged positions by means of a hydraulic or pneumatic system, but may be driven by any other suitable means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring primarily to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the frame assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which comprises a pair of links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from a link adapter <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The link adapter defines a central opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through which the top drive output shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may pass. Mounted to the link adapter on diametrically opposed sides of the central opening are respective upwardly extending, tubular members <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which are spaced a predetermined distance apart to allow the top drive output shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to pass therebetween. The respective tubular members connect at their upper ends to a rotating head <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the top drive assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for movement therewith. The rotating head defines a central opening (not shown) through which the top drive output shaft may pass, and also includes a bearing (not shown) which engages the upper ends of the tubular members and permits the tubular members to rotate relative to the rotating head body, as is described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The top drive output shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> terminates at its lower end in an internally splined coupler <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is engaged to an upper end of the lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (not shown) which is formed to complement the splined coupler for rotation therewith. Thus, when the top drive output shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is rotated by the top drive motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is also rotated. It will be understood that any suitable interface may be used to securely engage the top and lower drive shafts together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one illustrative embodiment, the lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to a conventional pipe handler, generally designated <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which may be engaged by a suitable torque wrench (not shown) to rotate the lower drive shaft and thereby make and break connections that require very high torque, as is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is also formed with a splined segment <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, which is slidably received in an elongated, splined bushing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which serves as an extension of the lower drive shaft. The drive shaft and bushing are splined to provide for vertical movement of the shaft relative to the bushing, as is described in greater detail below. It will be understood that the splined interface causes the bushing to rotate when the lower drive shaft rotates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes the lower pipe engagement assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which in one embodiment comprises a torque transfer sleeve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which is securely connected to the lower end of the bushing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for rotation therewith. The torque transfer sleeve is generally annular and includes a pair of upwardly projecting arms <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on diametrically opposed sides of the sleeve. The arms are formed with respective horizontal through passageways (not shown) into which are mounted respective bearings (not shown) which serve to journal a rotatable axle <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> therein, as described in greater detail below. The transfer sleeve connects at its lower end to a downwardly extending torque frame <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in the form of a pair of tubular members <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, which in turn is coupled to a spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which rotates with the torque frame. It will be apparent that the torque frame may take many, such as a plurality of tubular members, a solid body, or any other suitable structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is preferably powered by a hydraulic or pneumatic system, or alternatively by an electric drive motor or any other suitable powered system. In the embodiment disclosed, the spider&bsol;elevator includes a housing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> which defines a central passageway <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> through which the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may pass. The spider&bsol;elevator also includes a pair of hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> with displaceable piston rods <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>) which are connected through suitable pivotable linkages <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> to respective slips <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The linkages are pivotally connected to both the top ends of the piston rods and to the top ends of the slips. The slips include generally planar front gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and specially contoured rear surfaces <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which are designed with such a contour to cause the slips to travel between respective radially outwardly disposed, disengaged positions, and radially inwardly disposed, engaged positions. The rear surfaces of the slips travel along respective downwardly and radially inwardly projecting guiding members <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which are complementarily contoured and securely connected to the spider body. The guiding members cooperate with the cylinders and linkages to cam the slips radially inwardly and force the slips into the respective engaged positions. Thus, the cylinders (or other actuating means) may be empowered to drive the piston rods downwardly, causing the corresponding linkages to be driven downwardly and therefore force the slips downwardly. The surfaces of the guiding members are angled to force the slips radially inwardly as they are driven downwardly to sandwich the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> between them, with the guiding members maintaining the slips in tight engagement with the pipe segment. To release the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the cylinders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are operated in reverse to drive the piston rods upwardly, which draws the linkages upwardly and retracts the respective slips back to their disengaged positions to release the pipe segment. The guiding members are preferably formed with respective notches <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> which receive respective projecting portions <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> of the slips to lock the slips in the disengaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> further includes a pair of diametrically opposed, outwardly projecting ears <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> formed with downwardly facing recesses <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> sized to receive correspondingly formed, cylindrical members <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> at the bottom ends of the respective links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and thereby securely connect the lower ends of the links to the spider&bsol;elevator. The ears may be connected to an annular sleeve <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> which is received over the housing <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, or may be formed integral with the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In one illustrative embodiment, the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a load compensator, generally designated <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The load compensator preferably is in the form of a pair of hydraulic, double rodded cylinders <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, each of which includes a pair of piston rods <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> that are selectively extendable from, and retractable into, the cylinder. The upper rods connect to a compensator clamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which in turn is connected to the lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, while the lower rods extend downwardly and connect at the respective lower ends to a pair of ears <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which are securely mounted to the bushing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The hydraulic cylinders may be actuated to draw the bushing upwardly relative to the lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by applying a pressure to the cylinders which causes the upper piston rods to retract into the respective cylinder bodies, with the splined interface between the bushing and lower drive shaft allowing the bushing to be displaced vertically relative to the shaft. In that manner, the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carried by the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may be raised vertically to relieve a portion or all of the load applied to the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as is described in greater detail below. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the lower rods are at least partially retracted, resulting in the majority of the load from the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is assumed by the top drive output shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In addition, when a load above a preselected maximum is applied to the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the cylinders <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> will automatically react the load to prevent the entire load from being applied to the threads of the pipe segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> still further includes a hoist mechanism, generally designated <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, for hoisting a pipe segment upwardly into the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The hoist mechanism is disposed off-axis and includes a pair of pulleys <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> carried by the axle <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the axle being journaled into the bearings in respective through passageways formed in the arms <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The hoist mechanism also includes a gear drive, generally designated <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, that may be selectively driven by a hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> or other suitable drive system to rotate the axle and thus the pulleys. The hoist may also include a brake <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to prevent rotation of the axle and therefore of the pulleys and lock them in place, as well as a torque hub <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a pair of chains, cables, or other suitable, flexible means may be run over the respective pulleys, extended through a chain well <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and engaged to the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the axle is then rotated by a suitable drive system to hoist the pipe segment vertically and up into position with the upper end of the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> extending into the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably further includes an annular collar <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> which is received over the links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and which maintains the links locked to the ears <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and prevents the links from twisting and/or winding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In use, a work crew may manipulate the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> until the upper end of the tool is aligned with the lower end of the top drive output shaft <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is then raised vertically until the splined coupler <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at the lower end of the top drive output shaft is engaged to the upper end of the lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are engaged with the ears <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. The work crew may then run a pair of chains or cables over the respective pulleys <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of the hoist mechanism <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, connect the chains or cables to a pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, engage a suitable drive system to the gear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and actuate the drive system to rotate the pulleys and thereby hoist the pipe segment upwardly until the upper end of the pipe segment extends through the lower end of the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The spider&bsol;elevator is then actuated, with the hydraulic cylinders <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and guiding members <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> cooperating to forcibly drive the respective slips <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> into the engaged positions (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>) to positively engage the pipe segment. The slips are preferably advanced to a sufficient extent to prevent relative rotation between the pipe segment and the spider&bsol;elevator, such that rotation of the spider&bsol;elevator translates into rotation of the pipe segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The top drive assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then lowered relative to the frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by means of the top hoist <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to drive the threaded lower end of the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> into contact with the threaded upper end of the pipe string <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pipe string is securely held in place by means of the flush-mounted spider <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or any other suitable structure for securing the string in place, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Once the threads are properly mated, the top drive motor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then actuated to rotate the top drive output shaft, which in turn rotates the lower drive shaft of the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which causes the coupled pipe segment to rotate and thereby be threadedly engaged to the pipe string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is intentionally lowered until the lower end of the pipe segment rests on the top of the pipe string <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The load compensator <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is then actuated to drive the bushing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> upwardly relative to the lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the splined interface between the two. The upward movement of the bushing causes the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and therefore the coupled pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be raised, thereby reducing the weight on the threads of the pipe segment. In this manner, the load on the threads can be controlled by actuating the load compensator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Once the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is threadedly coupled to the pipe string, the top drive assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is raised vertically to lift the entire pipe string <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which causes the flush-mounted spider <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to disengage the string. The top drive assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then lowered to advance the string downwardly into the well hole until the upper end of the top pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is close to the drill floor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, with the entire load of the pipe string being carried by the links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> while the torque was supplied through shafts. The flush-mounted spider <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is then actuated to engage the pipe string and suspend it therefrom. The spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is then controlled in reverse to retract the slips <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> back to the respective disengaged positions (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>) to release the pipe string. The top drive assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then raised to lift the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> up to a starting position (such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and the process may be repeated with an additional pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, there is shown a block diagram of components included in one illustrative embodiment of the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the tool includes a conventional load cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or other suitable load-measuring device mounted on the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in such a manner that it is in communication with the lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to determine the load applied to the lower end of the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The load cell is operative to generate a signal representing the load sensed, which in one illustrative embodiment is transmitted to a processor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The processor is programmed with a predetermined threshold load value, and compares the signal from the load cell with that value. If the load exceeds the value, the processor then controls the load compensator <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to draw upwardly a selected amount to relieve at least a portion of the load on the threads of the pipe segment. Once the load is at or below the threshold value, the processor controls the top drive assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to rotate the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and thereby threadedly engage the pipe segment to the pipe string <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. While the top drive assembly is actuated, the processor continues to monitor the signals from the load cell to ensure that the load on the pipe segment does not exceed the threshold value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the load on the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be controlled manually, with the load cell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> indicating the load on the pipe segment via a suitable gauge or other display, with a work person controlling the load compensator <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and top drive assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is shown another preferred embodiment of the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The pipe running tool includes a hoisting mechanism <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> which is substantially the same as the hoisting mechanism <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> described above. A lower drive shaft <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is provided and connects at its lower end to a conventional mud-filling device <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which, as is known in the art, is used to fill a pipe segment, for example, a casing segment, with mud during the assembly process. In one illustrative embodiment, the mud-filling device is a device manufactured by Davies-Lynch Inc. of Texas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The hoisting mechanism <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> supports a pair of chains <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which engage a slip-type single joint elevator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> at the lower end of the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As is known in the art, the single joint elevator is operative to releasably engage a pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, with the hoisting mechanism <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> being operative to raise the single joint elevator and pipe segment upwardly and into the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The tool <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes the links <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which define the cylindrical lower ends <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which are received in generally J-shaped cut-outs <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> formed in diametrically opposite sides of the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, there is shown a system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for greater elevator offset according to another aspect of the invention. As in the embodiment discussed with relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> above, the greater offset spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> according to the present invention includes a housing <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which defines a central passageway <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> through which the pipe segment <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may pass. The spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> also includes at least a pair of hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> with displaceable piston rods <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>), which are connected through suitable pivotable linkages <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> to respective slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The linkages <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected to both the top ends of the piston rods <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and to the top ends of the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. In addition, the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of the greater offset elevator of the current embodiment may include conventional generally planar front gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As in the conventional slip design, the rear surfaces of the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> travel along respective downwardly and radially inwardly projecting guiding members <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, which are complementarily contoured and securely connected to the spider body <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The guiding members <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> cooperate with the cylinders <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and linkages <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> to cam the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> radially inwardly and force the slips into the respective engaged positions. Thus, the cylinders <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (or other actuating means) may be empowered to drive the piston rods <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> downwardly, causing the corresponding linkages <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> to be driven downwardly and therefore force the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> downwardly. The surfaces of the guiding members <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are angled to force the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> radially inwardly as they are driven downwardly to sandwich the pipe segment <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> between them, with the guiding members maintaining the slips in tight engagement with the pipe segment. To release the pipe segment <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the cylinders <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> are operated in reverse to drive the piston rods <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> upwardly, which draws the linkages <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> upwardly and retracts the respective slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> back to their disengaged positions to release the pipe segment. The guiding members <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are preferably formed with respective notches <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> which receive respective projecting portions <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> of the slips to lock the slips in the disengaged position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of this embodiment have specially contoured rear surfaces <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> having downwardly tapering frustoconical wedge surfaces <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, which are designed with such a contour so as to engage correspondingly shaped wedge surfaces <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> on the slip bowl body sections <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> such that the wedge surfaces on both the slips and the slip bowl are received in corresponding recesses to maximize the movement of the slip radially outward from its active gripping position, thereby allowing reception between the retracted slips of casing, drill pipe, and even large joints or enlargements on pipe. During operation, then, downward or upward movement of the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> not only cause the slips to travel between respective radially outwardly disposed, disengaged positions, and radially inwardly disposed, engaged positions, but also allow the slips to withdraw further into the slip bowl body <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> such that the diameter of the central passageway <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> may be enlarged to accommodate both conventional casing and drill pipe and drill pipe joints. For example, conventional spider&bsol;elevator designs have an retracted offset of only about 1 inch, and consequently have a central passageway <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> having a diameter of only about 16&Prime; to 16.5&Prime; inches. Such an opening only allows the insertion of conventional casing sizes. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the deeply undercut inner surfaces and wedge surfaces of the spider&bsol;elevator provide a retracted position offset greater than 1 inch, providing a central passageway <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> having a diameter of&tilde;22&Prime; inch allowing the insertion of drill pipe tool joints without interfering with the front surfaces <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> of the slips. Accordingly, the slip of ths design can be utilized to back-up both casing and drill pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, as before, the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is preferably powered by a hydraulic or pneumatic system, or alternatively by an electric drive motor or any other suitable powered system. In one preferred embodiment, the greater offset spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> has a 3-slip design, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> and discussed above, powered with three five-inch diameter cylinders <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Such a design provides greater down force power for centering and backing up pipe and the 3-slip design allows the central passageway <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to be enlarged allowing large bits, pipe and casing to be run through the pipe running tool system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As in the conventional spider/elevator described in relation to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> may further include a pair of diametrically opposed, outwardly projecting ears formed with downwardly facing recesses sized to receive correspondingly formed, cylindrical members at the bottom ends of the respective links, and thereby securely connect the lower ends of the links to the spider&bsol;elevator. The ears may be connected to an annular sleeve, which is received over the housing, or may be formed integral with the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Finally, although slips having conventional planar front gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> are described above, the front surfaces <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> of the slips <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> may be designed with a groove <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> which allows the insertion of a insert carrier <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C and 8D</cross-reference>. The insert carriers <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> comprise a body <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> having a back surface <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> designed as a wedge to engage the groove in the front surface of the slip body <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The front surface <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of the insert carrier is designed with a toothed gripping surface designed to gripingly engage the tubular member introduced into the central passageway <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the spider&bsol;elevatore <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Although the insert carrier <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of the current embodiment may be secured to the slip face <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> through any conventional engagement means, in a preferred embodiment, the insert carrier is secured to the slip <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> via a single hing pin <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</cross-reference> such that the insert carrier may be quickly engaged and removed from the slip body. Although only one insert carrier design is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8C and 8D</cross-reference>, it should be understood that slip inserts having a variety of dimensions may be manufactured to optimally engage a variety of different casing and pipe sizes such that pipes and casings of different sizes may be handle by the pipe running tool of the current embodiment by changing the insert carriers and without the need to change out the slip set itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be apparent that the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> efficiently utilizes an existing top drive assembly to assemble a pipe string, for example, a casing or drill string, and does not rely on cumbersome casing tongs and other conventional devices. The pipe running tool incorporates the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, which not only carries pipe segments, but also imparts rotation to them to threadedly engage the pipe segments to an existing pipe string. Thus, the pipe running tool provides a device which grips and torques the pipe segment <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and which also is capable of supporting the entire load of the pipe string as it is lowered down into the well hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the pipe running tool <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also be utilized to drive pipe and/or casing into a borehole. In such an embodiment, an assemble pipe string (assembled via any of the methods described above) would be supported in an embodiment of the spider&bsol;elevator <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> described above. The top drive would then be activated to rotate and lower the spider&bsol;elevator, which in turn would transmit the rotational and vertical motion of the top drive to the pipe segment such that the pipe string would be inserted into the borehole. Although the pipe string could be inserted without imparting a rotational motion, rotating the pipe string as it is lowered into the borehole helps prevent the pipe string from seizing and becoming stuck in the borehole. Likewise, when removing a pipe string it is like wise advantageous to provide rotational motion to the pipe string to ensure that the pipe string does not seize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While several forms of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications and improvements can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited, except as by the appended claims. </paragraph>
