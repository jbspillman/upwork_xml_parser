<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for fabricating a semiconductor memory device in general, and in particular, to a method for fabricating a flash memory device having a tunnel oxide layer with improved characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a flash memory device is one of the types of nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices. The flash memory device combines advantages of an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) device with the advantages of an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such a flash memory device can realize a storage state of one bit by means of one transistor, and perform electrical programming and erasing. The flash memory device having the above characteristics includes a thin tunnel oxide layer formed on a silicon substrate, and a floating gate and a control gate stacked in layers between which an insulating layer is interposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, as the flash memory device is reduced in size, the need for a tungsten gate electrode with low resistance is increased in the art. The use of tungsten for the gate electrode has the drawback that tungsten exposed to an oxidation process shows a rapid oxidizing reaction causing explosion (&quest;)/enlargement(&quest;) of the circuit pattern. In order to prevent such abnormal oxidation of tungsten, a sealing nitride layer should be additionally formed as a means of anti-oxidation, or selective oxidation should be performed only to the underlying polysilicon except tungsten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In relation to the above, a conventional method for fabricating a flash memory device is described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, on a cell region (A) of a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for a floating gate, an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for a control gate, a tungsten or tungsten nitride layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a hard mask nitride layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are deposited in sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, on a cell peripheral region (B), a low voltage or high voltage gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for the control gate, the tungsten or tungsten nitride layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a hard mask nitride layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are formed simultaneously with those of the cell region (A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Then, the above-mentioned layers are selectively patterned to form respectively gate patterns on the cell region (A) and the cell peripheral region (B) Here, etching progress in the cell region (A) is stopped at the ONO layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a first selective oxidation process is performed in order to relieve etching damage of the low voltage or high voltage gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the cell peripheral region (B). As a result, a selective oxidized layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on a lateral side of the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for the control gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Next, while the cell peripheral region (B) is covered with a photo resist pattern (not shown), the ONO layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the floating gate on the cell region (A) are selectively patterned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, in order to relieve etching damage of the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a second selective oxidation process is carried out. A second selective oxidized layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is therefore formed on a lateral side of the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the floating gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Next, a sealing nitride layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for anti-oxidation is deposited over an entire resultant structure. The sealing nitride layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is then, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, anisotropically etched all through the cell region (A) and the cell peripheral region (B). Thus, a sealing nitride pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for anti-oxidation is formed into a spacer shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the cell peripheral region (B) is covered with a photo resist pattern (not shown) and the cell region (A) is subjected to selective etch. By selectively etching the polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for the floating gate and the ONO layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to expose a surface of the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a polysilicon pattern <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an ONO pattern <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are therefore formed with a predetermined shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Though it is not shown in the drawings, a source and a drain are then formed in a surface of the cell region (A) of the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by implanting ions such as boron or arsenic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The flash memory device is completed after a thermal process, a spacer-forming process, and the like are performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The above-described conventional method has drawbacks as follows. In the conventional method, the selective oxidation process is performed twice. The first selective oxidation process is performed to relieve etching damage to the low voltage or high voltage gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the cell peripheral region (B). Also, the second selective oxidation process is performed to relieve etching damage of the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> after the layers on the cell region (A) are selectively patterned using a gate pattern mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Since the conventional selective oxidation process is carried out in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, supplied hydrogen gas is often transferred to the gate oxide layer or the tunnel oxide layer. Unfortunately, such transferred hydrogen gas is trapped in the oxide layer, thus producing a trap site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> That is, the influx of hydrogen causes the characteristics of the oxide layer to be affected very seriously in the nonvolatile devices such as flash memory devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for fabricating a flash memory device having a tunnel oxide layer with excellent characteristics by performing only a single normal oxidation process during metal contact etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This and other objects are attained by a method for fabricating a flash memory device in accordance with the present invention. The method begins with the step of sequentially forming a tunnel oxide layer, a floating gate, an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layer, a control gate, and a hard mask on a silicon substrate. The hard mask, the control gate, the ONO layer, and the floating gate are then sequentially patterned. Next, an insulating layer is formed on the entire resultant structure, and a contact hole is formed in the insulating layer in order to expose a portion of the silicon substrate. Thereafter, oxidation is performed on the entire resultant structure including the contact hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for fabricating a flash memory device begins with forming in sequence a tunnel oxide layer, a floating gate, an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layer, a control gate, and a hard mask nitride layer on a silicon substrate. The hard mask nitride layer, the control gate, the ONO layer, and the floating gate are then patterned in sequence. Next, a sealing nitride layer is formed on a lateral side of the patterned structure. Also, in order to form a spacer, a first insulating layer is deposited on the entire resultant structure and then selectively patterned. Thereafter, second, third and fourth insulating layers are formed in sequence on the entire resultant structure including the spacer, and a photo resist pattern is then formed on the fourth insulating layer in order to define a metal contact area. Next, the fourth, third and second insulating layers are selectively patterned through the photo resist pattern, so that a contact hole is formed exposing a portion of the silicon substrate. Also, oxidation is performed on the entire resultant structure including the contact hole.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be now described more fully hereinafter with reference to accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A method for fabricating a flash memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, on a cell region (A) of a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a first polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for a floating gate, an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, a second polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for a control gate, a tungsten or tungsten nitride layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and a hard mask nitride layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are deposited in sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition, on a cell peripheral region (B), a low voltage or high voltage gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the second polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for the control gate, the tungsten or tungsten nitride layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and a hard mask nitride layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are formed simultaneously with those of the cell region (A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned layers are then selectively patterned to form respectively gate patterns on the cell region (A) and the cell peripheral region (B) Here, etching progress in the cell region (A) is stopped at the ONO layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. According to the conventional method, a selective oxidation process in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere follows to relieve damage in subsequent gate etching. However, the method of the present invention does not require such a selective oxidation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a sealing nitride layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire resultant structure in order to prevent the oxidation of tungsten in subsequent processes. The sealing nitride layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is then patterned to form a sealing nitride pattern <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Thereafter, an LDD region (not shown) is formed in the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> under each side of the gate pattern of the cell peripheral region (B) by using LDD or DDD implantation. Here, the sealing nitride pattern <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>serves as a screen from implantation damage in the LDD implantation. The sealing nitride pattern <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has preferably a thickness of about 20&tilde;130 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, while the patterned hard mask nitride layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> on the cell region (A) is used as a mask, the ONO layer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the first polysilicon layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for the floating gate are selectively patterned. Then, by performing source/drain implantation toward the cell region (A) only, a source/drain <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is formed in the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> under each side of the gate pattern of the cell region (A). Here, the conventional method would employ another selective oxidation process to prevent etching damage of the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a nitride layer for a spacer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is deposited on the entire resultant structure. The nitride layer is then selectively patterned together with the sealing nitride layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. As a result, the nitride spacer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed on sidewalls of the cell region (A) and the cell peripheral region (B) Preferably, the nitride spacer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a thickness of about 300&tilde;1800 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, another source/drain <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is formed in the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> under each side of the gate pattern of the cell peripheral region (B). Subsequently, another nitride layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, an inter-poly oxide (IPO) layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and a boro-phosphorus silicate glass (BPSG) layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are deposited in sequence on the entire resultant structure including the cell peripheral region (B). The BPSG layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is then flowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the nitride layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has a thickness of about 100&tilde;700 &angst;, and the deposition thickness of the IPO layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is about 500&tilde;3500 &angst;. In addition, the BPSG layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> has a thickness of about 4000&tilde;14000 &angst;, a deposition temperature of 750&tilde;875&thgr; C., and a deposition time of 5&tilde;75 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Next, the BPSG layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is coated with a photo resist layer (not shown). The photo resist layer is then selectively patterned by means of photolithography technology, so that a contact hole area is defined by a photo resist pattern (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, while the photo resist pattern (not shown) is used as a mask, the BPSG layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, the IPO layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the nitride layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are then sequentially patterned to form metal contact holes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> exposing the source/drain <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, to form an undercut in the under part of the nitride spacer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a wet cleaning process follows. Preferably, the wet cleaning process uses a hydrogen fluoride (HF) solution of 50&tilde;100:1 or a buffered oxide etch (BOE) solution of 100&tilde;300:1 for 10&tilde;150 seconds before a subsequent oxidation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Next, a plug implantation process is performed to compensate for losses of source/drain implant dose due to the loss of the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> probably occurring in the metal contact etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Moreover, an oxidation process is then carried out to compensate for etching damage to the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the cell region (A) and the low voltage or high voltage gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the cell peripheral region (B) thereby to guarantee excellent characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The oxidation process is performed at a temperature of 750&tilde;1000&thgr; C. and a pressure of 0.1&tilde;760 Torr. Oxygen gas is supplied at a flow rate of 5&tilde;20 SLM, and an oxidation thickness is set to cover 20&tilde;300 &angst; as a monitoring thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a loading temperature in the oxidation process is regulated at 300&tilde;600&thgr; C., and a nitrogen flow rate in loading ranges of 2&tilde;30 SLM. Also, a ramping rate of major oxidation temperature maintains 1&tilde;100&thgr; C./minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> After the oxidation process and before a deposition process of Ti/TiN, a cleaning process is performed. Preferably, the cleaning process uses a HF solution of 50&tilde;100:1 or a BOE solution of 100&tilde;300:1 for 10&tilde;150 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the contact holes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are established, the BPSG layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, the IPO layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and the nitride layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are sequentially etched. As a result, an oxide layer may remain in an active area of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or the loss of the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> due to over-etching may occur. During a subsequent oxidation process, oxidizing gas can move smoothly through the undercut in the under part of the nitride spacer <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Therefore, etching damage is relieved in the tunnel oxide layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or the low voltage or high voltage gate oxide layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Consequently, it is possible to form a strong oxide sidewall. Also, preventing the influx of hydrogen in the oxidation process may remove the cause of the deterioration of the tunnel oxide layer or the gate oxide layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As fully described hereinbefore, a method for fabricating a flash memory device according to the present invention has at least the following advantages and effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the gate etching process, the tunnel oxide layer or the gate oxide layer is often damaged by etching. Such etching damage is relieved in the oxidation process after metal contact etching, so that oxidation for lowering energy is simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the oxide layer obtained by the normal oxidation process of the present invention has better characteristics than the conventional oxide layer formed by the twice-selective oxidation process. This results because there is no possibility that a trap site is produced in the oxide layer by hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention can substitute the oxidation process for a rapid thermal process conventionally used for dose activation after plug implantation. Accordingly, the number of steps in the whole process is decreased and thereby the production cost is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, according to the reduction in design rule, the formation of a surface channel PMOS is unavoidable. Here, boron ions implanted into a PMOS area may be penetrated into a channel via the gate oxide layer during the high-temperature process for selective oxidation. This may result in unexpected degradation in characteristics of the gate oxide layer. However, the present invention substitutes only a single normal oxidation process for the conventional high temperature selective oxidation process performed twice. This can therefore increase stability to boron penetration and lead to the easy setup of transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention. Although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>
