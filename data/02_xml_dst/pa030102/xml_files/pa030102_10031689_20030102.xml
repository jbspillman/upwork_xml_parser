<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an exhaust gas recirculation apparatus and an exhaust gas recirculation method for an internal combustion engine, and particularly to the technology of reducing a discharge amount of nitrogen oxides (to be referred as Nox hereinafter). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TECHNIQUE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Here-to-fore, there has been widely adopted an exhaust gas recirculation (to be referred as EGR hereinafter) apparatus in which a part of exhaust gas in an internal combustion engine is returned to an intake system, and the part of exhaust gas functions as a kind of inert gas to lower a combustion temperature, thereby reducing a discharge amount of NOx. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Due to recent demands for light weight of a vehicle, and improvement of fuel consumption and performance, there have been proposed many internal combustion engines each provided with a turbocharger as a kind of supercharger. Particularly, a diesel engine is better in light of fuel consumption compared with a gasoline engine, however, has a low engine power and cannot meet high-speed rotation. Therefore, it is very beneficial to use a high torque obtained by installing a turbocharger for overcoming these drawbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Since the EGR apparatus uses a differential pressure between an exhaust pressure in an exhaust passage and a negative pressure in an intake passage to return a part of exhaust gas to the intake system, an internal combustion engine mounted with a turbocharger has the following problems. Namely, in a case where the turbocharger has high efficiency, an outlet pressure (negative pressure) of a compressor disposed in the intake passage becomes higher than an inlet pressure (exhaust pressure) of a turbine disposed in the exhaust passage, and therefore, it becomes impossible to return the part of the exhaust gas to the intake system due to the differential pressure. Therefore, as disposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-266866, there is proposed the technology in which an intake throttle valve is disposed on the downstream side of a compressor and, at a low load operation, the intake throttle valve is closed to raise up the negative pressure in the intake passage (namely, to lower the intake pressure), thereby improving an EGR rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In such a conventional technology, however, although it is possible to increase the differential pressure by the intake throttle valve, an opening degree of the intake throttle valve becomes extremely small depending on engine operation conditions, possibly resulting in problems of such as engine power reduction and emission performance deterioration. Further, since an engine operation region where the differential pressure between the compressor outlet pressure and the turbine inlet pressure can be sufficiently established is narrow, it is very difficult to reduce NOx in the exhaust gas any further. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention, from a viewpoint of the foregoing problems, has an object of providing an exhaust gas recirculation apparatus and an exhaust gas recirculation method for an internal combustion engine wherein a differential pressure between an exhaust pressure in an exhaust passage and a negative pressure in an intake passage is increased, to improve an EGR rate, thereby reducing an NOx discharge amount. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, according to an apparatus of the present invention, an exhaust gas recirculation apparatus for an internal combustion engine mounted with a turbocharger in which a turbine is disposed in an exhaust passage and a compressor is disposed in an intake passage, comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> a passage opening and closing device that opens or closes an exhaust gas recirculation passage communicating the exhaust passage on the upstream side of the turbine with the intake passage on the downstream side of the compressor; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> a port opening and closing device that opens or closes a port formed on the intake passage on the downstream side of the compressor; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> an operating condition detecting device that detects an engine operating condition; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> a control unit that incorporates a microcomputer therein, wherein the control unit judges whether or not the exhaust gas is to be recirculated based on the engine operating condition detected by the operating condition detecting device, and when it is judged that the exhaust gas is to be recirculated, performs a control to open the exhaust gas recirculation passage by the passage opening and closing device and at the same time to open the port by the port opening and closing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, according to a method of the present invention, an exhaust gas recirculation method for an internal combustion engine mounted with a turbocharger in which a turbine is disposed in an exhaust passage and a compressor is disposed in an intake passage, comprises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> judging whether or not the exhaust gas is to be recirculated based on an engine operating condition; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> opening an exhaust gas recirculation passage communicating an exhaust passage on the upstream side of the turbine with an intake passage on the downstream side of the compressor when it is judged that the exhaust gas is to be recirculated; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> opening also a port formed on the intake passage on the downstream side of the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the above construction, it is judged whether the exhaust gas is to be recirculated based on the engine operating condition, and when it is judged that the exhaust gas is to be recirculated, the exhaust gas recirculation passage communicating the exhaust passage on the upstream side of the turbine with the intake passage on the downstream side of compressor is opened and the port formed on the intake passage on the downstream side of the compressor is also opened. Then, when the port is opened, since an intake air on the downstream side of the compressor is released into the atmosphere, a negative pressure in the intake passage is lowered, and on the other hand, since an exhaust pressure in the exhaust passage is not lowered so much, a differential pressure between the exhaust pressure in the exhaust passage and the negative pressure in the intake passage is increased. Therefore, a large amount of the exhaust gas is recirculated into the intake passage through the exhaust gas recirculation passage, to improve an exhaust gas recirculation rate, so that an NOx discharge amount can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Here, It is preferable to form an intake air return passage that returns the intake air taken out of the port to an intake passage on the upstream side of the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, since the intake air taken out of the port formed on the intake passage is returned to the intake passage on the upstream side of the compressor through the intake air return passage, the intake air compressed by the compressor is reused. Therefore, the efficiency of turbocharger can be prevented from being lowered, to restrain an engine power reduction. Further, the fuel consumption can be effectively improved in a low load operation region, and also, the reduction of fuel consumption can be suppressed in the other load operation regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that an opening angle of the port is controlled in multi-stepwise based on the engine operating condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, since the opening angle of the port formed on the intake passage is controlled in multi-stepwise based on the engine operating condition, the differential pressure between the exhaust pressure in the exhaust passage and the negative pressure in the intake passage is properly controlled, to thereby perform the exhaust gas recirculation effectively, while preventing the reduction of engine driveability and the deterioration of emission performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is preferable that the port is opened or closed by a port opening and closing device comprising at least one of a shutter, a butterfly valve and a poppet valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to this construction, since the port opening and closing device comprises at least one of typical shutter, butterfly valve and poppet valve, its manufacturing cost can be restrained as much as possible while maintaining the reliability and durability thereof. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanied drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an entire block diagram of a diesel engine embodying an EGR technology according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a turbine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> composing a turbocharger are respectively disposed in an intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an exhaust passage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a diesel engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The turbine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> absorbs the exhaust gas energy flowing through the exhaust passage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to drive the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> integrally connected thereto through a shaft <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The intake air from which impurities such as dust is eliminated by an air cleaner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is compressed by the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> disposed in the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be in a supercharged state and then is introduced into a combustion chamber of the diesel engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At this time, since the charging efficiency of the intake air compressed by the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is lowered due to the temperature rise of compressed intake air by the adiabatic compression, an intercooler <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is disposed in the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the purpose of lowering the temperature of intake air after compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The exhaust passage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the upstream side of the turbine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the downstream side of the intercooler <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (namely, the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) are communicated with each other by an EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. An EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that opens or closes the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is disposed in the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for controlling an EGR amount. The EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is opened or closed by the air supplied from an air reservoir tank not shown through an EGR control solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be drive controlled by a control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> incorporating a microcomputer therein. Namely, when the EGR control solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned ON, the air is supplied from the air reservoir tank to the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, then the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is opened and the EGR is performed. On the other hand, when the EGR control solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned OFF, the air supplied from the air reservoir tank to the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is shut off, then the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is closed and the EGR is suspended. The EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the EGR control solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> constitute a passage opening and closing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the upstream side and the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> disposed in the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are communicated with each other by a communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as an intake air return passage. A boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> capable of switching the opening angle thereof at least at the full open position and at the full close position is disposed in the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The opening angle of the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is controlled through an actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> controlled by the control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> constitute a port opening and closing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Various constitutions can be used as the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and some specific constitutions will be explained as follows. However, the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is not limited to the following constitutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that opens or closes a port (not shown) formed on a peripheral wall of the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is disposed to the end portion of the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> facing the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is drive controlled by the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so that an opening angle of the shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be controlled at the full open position and at the full close position, preferably controlled in multi-stepwise between the full open position and the full close position. As shown in a second embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> butterfly valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be disposed in the intermediate position of the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> instead of the shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that an opening angle of the butterfly valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is drive controlled by the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, in a case where the shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment is controlled at the full open position and at the full close position, the butterfly valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be disposed in the intermediate position of the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in addition to the shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> as shown in a third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In this case, the shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is drive controlled at the full open position and at the full close position by an actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and on the other hand, the butterfly valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is drive controlled in multi-stepwise between the full open position and the full close position by an actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Namely, in the third embodiment, the shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> performs the opening or closing operation of the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the butterfly valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> performs the opening angle control of the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, since the working accuracy requested to the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the butterfly valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> becomes lower compared with the constitution where the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is opened or closed only by the butterfly valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, it becomes possible to constitute the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at a low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In addition, as in a fourth embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> poppet valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be disposed at the end portion of the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> facing the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, so that an opening angle of the poppet valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is controlled in multi-stepwise by duty-control like the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this way, if the typical shutter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, butterfly valve <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, poppet valve <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are used as the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the rise in cost of the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be restrained as much as possible, while maintaining the reliability and durability thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is controlled in association with the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Namely, when the EGR is performed, the intake air that has been compressed by the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be in a supercharged state is returned to the upstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the negative pressure in the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is lowered, and the differential pressure between the exhaust pressure in the exhaust passage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the negative pressure in the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is increased. This operation is called &ldquo;boost return&rdquo; hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In order to control the EGR apparatus, outputs from a load sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that detects an engine load L, a rotation speed sensor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that detects an engine rotation speed N, a negative pressure sensor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that detects a negative pressure Pb on the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an exhaust pressure sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that detects an exhaust pressure Pe on the upstream side of the turbine <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are respectively input to the control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as an engine operating condition detecting device. Then, at the control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are controlled based on respective signals from these sensors according to the processing described later. At the control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a judgment step and an opening and closing step are realized by software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a control routine of the EGR apparatus executed by software at the control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in order to control the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the full open position or at the full close position. This control is executed repeatedly for each predetermined period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (abbreviated as S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the figure, and the same rule is applied to the followings), the engine rotation speed N and the engine load L are read out from the rotation speed sensor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the load sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an EGR control map as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is referred to and it is judged whether or not the engine operating condition determined by the engine rotation speed N and the engine load L is within a region where the EGR is performed (to be referred as EGR region hereinafter). In the EGR control map shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is judged whether or not the engine operating condition is within the EGR region based on a control state (on/off) of the EGR control solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a branching process is performed in accordance with the engine operating condition. If the engine operating condition is within the EGR region, the routine proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (Yes) while if the engine operating condition is not within the EGR region, the routine proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (No). The process of Step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and Step <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> corresponds to the judgment step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a control to perform the EGR is executed. Namely, the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is controlled in order to open the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and also the EGR control solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned &ldquo;ON&rdquo; in order to open the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The process of Step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> corresponds to the opening and closing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a control to stop the EGR is executed. Namely, the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is controlled in order to close the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and also the EGR solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; in order to close the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to the process of Step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to Step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as explained above, if the engine operating condition is within the EGR region, the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is opened, as well as the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is opened by the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Then, when the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is opened, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the intake air on the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is returned to the upstream side thereof to lower the negative pressure Pb. On the other hand, since the exhaust pressure Pe in the exhaust passage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is not reduced as much as the negative pressure Pb is reduced, a differential pressure &Dgr;P between the negative pressure Pb and the exhaust pressure Pe is increased. Therefore, the EGR rate and the EGR applicable region get larger compared with a conventional EGR apparatus, and at the same time, a large amount of exhaust gas is recirculated to the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, so that the NOx discharge amount is reduced due to the improvement of EGR rate. Further, since the differential pressure &Dgr;P for improving the EGR rate is produced by the boost return, an intake air amount per unit time is reduced and as a result, the fuel consumption can be improved by advancing the fuel injection timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> According to the EGR apparatus of such a constitution, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, at the <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> mode (measuring mode defined in Japan), the NOx discharge amount can be reduced by about 26% and also an emission amount of particularte matter (PM) can be reduced by about 56% while improving brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) at a low load operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a control routine of the EGR apparatus executed by software in the control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in order to control in multi-stepwise the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> between the full open position and the full close position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the engine rotation speed N and the engine load L are respectively read out from the rotation speed sensor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the load sensor <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the EGR control map as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is referred to and it is judged whether or not the engine operating condition determined by the engine rotation speed N and the engine load L is within the EGR region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a branch process is performed in accordance with the engine operating condition. When the engine operating condition is within the EGR region, the routine proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (Yes), while when the engine operating condition is not within the EGR region, the routine proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (No). The process of Step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and Step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> corresponds to the judgment step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the EGR is started. Namely, the EGR solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned &ldquo;ON&rdquo; in order to open the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a target differential pressure control map as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is referred to and a target differential pressure Pr and a minimum negative pressure Pw are set based on the engine rotation speed N and the engine load L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a negative pressure Pb and an exhaust pressure Pe are read out from a negative pressure sensor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and an exhaust pressure sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, based on the read out negative pressure Pe and exhaust pressure Pe, the differential pressure &Dgr;P is computed by the following formula. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&Dgr;<highlight><italic>P&equals;Pe&minus;Pb </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it is judged whether or not the differential pressure &Dgr;P is the target differential pressure Pr or above. When the differential pressure &Dgr;P is the target differential pressure Pr or above, the routine proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (Yes), while when the differential pressure &Dgr;P is less than the target differential pressure Pr, the routine proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (No). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it is judged whether or not the differential pressure &Dgr;P is an addition value of the target difference pressure Pr and an allowable value W, or less. Here, the allowable value is a so-called limitter that prevents the differential pressure &Dgr;P from becoming greater than necessary, thereby enabling to prevent the deterioration of emission performance. When the differential pressure &Dgr;P is the addition value or less, it is judged that the differential pressure &Dgr;P is controlled to a proper value and the routine returns to Step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (Yes). On the other hand, when the differential pressure &Dgr;P is greater than the addition value, it is judged that the differential pressure &Dgr;P is too great, the routine proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (No). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the opening angle of the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is made smaller by one step in order to lower the differential pressure &Dgr;P. Thereafter, the routine returns to Step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, wherein the differential pressure control is continued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> where the process of when the differential pressure &Dgr;P is less than the target differential pressure Pr is executed, it is judged whether or not the negative pressure Pb is the minimum negative pressure Pw or more. When the negative pressure Pb is the minimum negative pressure Pw or more, the routine proceeds to Step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (Yes), while when the negative pressure Pb is less than the minimum negative pressure Pw, the routine returns to Step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (No). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the opening angle of the boost return valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is made larger by one step in order to increase the differential pressure &Dgr;P. Afterwards, the routine returns to Step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, wherein the differential pressure control is continued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The process of Step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&tilde;Step <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> corresponds to the opening and closing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> where the process of when the engine operating condition is not within the EGR region is executed, the control to stop the EGR is executed. Namely, the actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is controlled to fully close the communicating passage <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and also the EGR control solenoid valve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is turned &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; to close the EGR passage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the EGR valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> According to the process of Step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>&tilde;Step <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as explained above, in addition to functions and effects by the EGR control shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the differential pressure &Dgr;P is properly controlled in accordance with the engine operating condition. Namely, since the differential pressure &Dgr;P is controlled to be in the scope of the following formula, the EGR can be performed effectively while preventing the engine driveability and the emission performance from being deteriorated. Thus it becomes possible to reduce effectively the NOx discharge amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Pr</italic></highlight>(target differential pressure)&lE;&Dgr;<highlight><italic>P</italic></highlight>(differential pressure)&lE;<highlight><italic>Pr&plus;W</italic></highlight>(target differential pressure&plus;allowable value) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if the negative pressure Pb is less than the minimum negative pressure set in accordance with the engine operating condition, since the differential pressure control is not performed, an increase in a discharge amount of particularte matter discharged from the engine is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, when the EGR is performed, the intake air on the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is returned to the upstream side thereof. However, the intake air on the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be released to the atmosphere. In this case, by releasing the intake air on the downstream side of the compressor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the atmosphere, the negative pressure in the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is lowered and the differential pressure &Dgr;P between the exhaust pressure Pe in the exhaust passage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the negative pressure in the intake passage <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is increased. Accordingly, the same effect as in the previous embodiment is achieved. Namely, such a constitution is the smallest constitution of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Further, needless to say, the EGR apparatus and the EGR method according to the invention can be applied to a gasoline engine and the like. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As explained above, the EGR apparatus and the EGR method according to the invention are extremely useful because the differential pressure between the exhaust pressure in the exhaust passage and the negative pressure in the intake passage is increased to improve the EGR rate, so that a NOx discharge amount can be reduced. </paragraph>
