<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and a method of manufacturing the same, and more specifically to a semiconductor device comprising a vertical pnp (V-PNP) bipolar transistor, and a method of manufacturing such a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recent semiconductor integrated circuits, for example, bipolar integrated circuits have a structure wherein both npn-bipolar transistors and vertical pnp-bipolar transistors are packaged together. Also as represented by a BiCMOS, various elements, such as npn-bipolar transistors, MOS transistors, and pnp-bipolar transistors may be packaged together on the same substrate to constitute one chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are schematic sectional views for illustrating the sequence of process steps of a method of manufacturing a conventional bipolar integrated circuit wherein an npn-bipolar transistor (NPN), an lateral pnp-bipolar transistor (L-PNP), and a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor (V-PNP) are packaged together. The configuration and manufacturing method of a conventional bipolar integrated circuit will be described below referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A, a</cross-reference> silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 6000 angstrom is formed on a p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and an opening <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed in the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by photolithography followed by dry etching. Then, phosphorus (P) ions are implanted into the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as a mask under the condition of an acceleration energy of 120 keV, and a dose of 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 1200&deg; C. for 30 minutes. Thereby, a buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-type layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed on the area where in V-PNP is to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, after the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is removed, a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 6000 angstrom is formed on the surface of the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and an opening is formed in the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by photolithography followed by dry etching. Then, antimony (Sb) ions are implanted into the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as a mask under the condition of an acceleration energy of 50 keV, and a dose of 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 1200&deg; C. for 2 hours. Thereby, a buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is formed on the area where an NPN and an L-PNP are to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>C, after the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is removed, an underlying oxide film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 1000 angstrom is formed, and a resist film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> having a prescribed opening is formed by photolithography. Then, boron (B) ions are implanted into the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> using the resist film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> as a mask under the condition of an acceleration energy of 50 keV, and a dose of 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 1000&deg; C. for 30 minutes. Thereby, a lower isolation layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> for isolating NPN, L-PNP, and V-PNP regions from each other. In the region to form the V-PNP, a collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> consisting of the same layer as the lower isolation layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is formed on the buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-type layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>D, after the resist film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the underlying oxide film <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are removed, epitaxial growth is performed. Thereby, an epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 4 &mgr;m, and a resistivity of about 3 &OHgr;&middot;cm is formed on the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, after a silicon nitride film (not shown) of a thickness of about 1000 angstrom is formed and patterned by photolithography followed by dry etching, the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of about 950&deg; C. for about 3 hours to form a field oxide film <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 15000 angstrom on the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, an underlying oxide film <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 500 angstrom is formed on the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and a resist film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> having a prescribed opening is formed by photolithography. Thereafter, boron (B) ions are implanted using the resist film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as a mask under the condition of an acceleration energy of 50 keV, and a dose of 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 1000&deg; C. for 30 minutes. Thereby, an upper isolation layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> connected to the lower isolation layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, and for isolating NPN, L-PNP, and V-PNP regions from each other together with the lower isolation layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, is formed. Also in the region to form the V-PNP, a collector contact layer <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> consisting of the same layer as the upper isolation layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is formed, and connected to the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this step, instead of implanting boron ions, a boron-silicate glass (BSG) film may be deposited on the regions where these p-type diffused layers are to be formed, and subjected to heat treatment at about 800 to 1000&deg; C., to diffuse boron in the boron-silicate glass into the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, after the resist film <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is removed, a resist film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> having a prescribed opening is formed by photolithography. Thereafter, boron ions are implanted using the resist film <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as a mask under the condition of an acceleration energy of 50 keV, and a dose of 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 1000&deg; C. for 15 minutes. Thereby, a base layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is formed on the region to form the NPN, an emitter layer <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is formed on the region to form the V-PNP, and a diffused layer <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> to be an emitter layer and a collector layer is formed on the region to form the L-PNP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>D, after a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is selectively removed by photolithography followed by dry etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A, a</cross-reference> resist film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> having a prescribed opening is formed by photolithography. Then, arsenic (As) ions are implanted using the resist film <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> as a mask under the condition of an acceleration energy of 50 keV, and a dose of 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 1000&deg; C. for 20 minutes. Thereby, an emitter layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is formed in the base layer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on the region to form the NPN, and a base-leader layer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> connected to the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as the base layer is formed on the region to form the V-PNP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, an aluminum film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 6500 angstrom to be a contact layer is formed, and an electrode consisting of the aluminum film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is formed by photolithography followed by dry etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>C, an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which consists of silicon oxide film of a thickness of about 10000 angstrom is formed, and a through-hole <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that reaches the electrode consisting of the aluminum film <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is formed by photolithography followed by dry etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Then, an aluminum film <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 10000 angstrom is formed and patterned by photolithography followed by dry etching. Thereafter, a glass coating film <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of a thickness of about 7500 angstrom is formed, and a prescribed opening is formed by photolithography followed by dry etching. Thereby, the structure of a bipolar integrated circuit as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</cross-reference> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, in a conventional semiconductor device as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> different from other regions must be formed in the region to form a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor on a p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> must be formed in order to isolate the region other than the region to form the vertical pnp-bipolar transistor from the substrate potential, to use it as the collector layer of the npn-bipoler transistor, and to reduce the resistance of the collector layer. However, in the region to form the pnp-bipolar transistor, a p-type diffused layer, as the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, cannot be formed directly on the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> formed to be same as other regions. The reason is that since the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has a high concentration, the formation of the p-type diffused layer of the inverse conductivity type overlapping the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is difficult. Therefore, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows, the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed after the deep buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of a low concentration is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Although this buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has the function to isolate the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the potential of the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, process steps, such as the formation of the underlying silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, photolithography followed by dry etching, the implantation of phosphorus ions, heat treatment, and the removal of the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, is essential for forming the buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Therefore, problems of the complicated process steps, and increase in manufacturing costs arise. In addition, the buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> must be aligned with the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at high accuracy, and dimensional margins of about 2 &mgr;m in the horizontal direction must be secured on the both side of the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to form the buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. This is because the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> cannot be isolated electrically from the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, unless the buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is formed immediately under the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Therefore, increase in the area of the vertical pnp-bipolar transistor cannot be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the conventional semiconductor devices, as described above, a buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> different from other regions must be formed in the region to form a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor. This makes the process steps complicated, and results in increase in manufacturing costs. Also, since the buried n<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> must be accurately aligned to the collector layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the region to form a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor is expanded in order to secure the dimensional margins. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the object of the present invention is to solve the above-described problems, and to provide a semiconductor device comprising a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor that can isolate the collector layer from the substrate potential without requiring complicated process steps, lower the manufacturing costs, and achieve downsizing, and to provide a method of manufacturing such a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor substrate, an n-type buried layer of high concentration formed on the semiconductor substrate, a p-type diffused layer formed following the n-type buried layer on the n-type buried layer, and a pnp-bipolar transistor having the p-type diffused layer as a collector layer, formed on the semiconductor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprises the following steps. Firstly n-type impurities are introduced into a semiconductor substrate to form a first impurity-diffused layer. Secondly p-type impurities are introduced into a region where the first impurity-diffused layer has been formed. Thirdly an epitaxial layer is grown on the semiconductor substrate including an area on the first impurity-diffused layer to bury the first impurity-diffused layer. Fourthly the p-type impurities are diffused on the first impurity-diffused layer by heat treatment to form a second impurity-diffused layer containing the p-type impurities on the first impurity-diffused layer. Fifthly a pnp-bipolar transistor having the second impurity-diffused layer as a collector layer is formed on the first impurity-diffused layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, in a semiconductor device comprising a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor in a prescribed element region, by forming a p-type collector layer so as to adhere onto an n-type buried layer of a high concentration, the n-type buried layer can isolate the collector layer from the substrate potential. Also, by forming the p-type collector layer on the n-type buried layer, the p-type collector layer can be formed without special mask alignment, and the further downsizing of the device can be achieved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention will be described below referring to the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic sectional view showing the configuration of a semiconductor device according to the embodiment of the present invention. In the semiconductor device according to the embodiment, an epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed on a buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on a p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor (V-PNP) is formed on the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> undergone element isolation into islands by a trench isolation structure consisting of trenches formed to left and right of the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on the n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed on the p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> acts as a collector layer of the V-PNP. A p-well <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is formed as a collector-drawing portion on a part of the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and a collector-leader layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed on the surface region of the p-well <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A p-type emitter layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and an n-type base-leader layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are also formed on the surface region of the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> between the emitter layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is the collector layer, has an n-type conductivity, and the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> acts as a base layer. The base-leader layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has the function to supply the n-type epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with a prescribed potential. The V-PNP is constituted from the emitter layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (p-type), the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (n-type) that acts as the base layer, and the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (p-type) that acts as the collector layer. An electrode consisting of an aluminum film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is connected to each of the collector-leader layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the emitter layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the base-leader layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Generally, in semiconductor devices such as BiCMOS in which various elements such as bipolar transistors and MOS transistors are packaged together, a buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, acting as a collector layer or lowering the resistance of the collector layer, is formed in the region to form the NPN, and a buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, isolating from the substrate potential, is formed in the region to form the MOS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, since the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on the buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> acting as the collector layer can be isolated from the substrate potential by the buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Particularly in the semiconductor device of this embodiment, since the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed on the buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by flotation utilizing difference in diffusion coefficients between the both buried layers, as described later, it is ensured that the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of a high concentration is formed on the buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a high concentration. Therefore, the collector layer (buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) of the V-PNP can be isolated from the substrate potential using the buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> formed in the regions of other elements such as the NPN as it is. Thereby, in the region to form the V-PNP, the formation of a buried layer different from buried layers in the regions to form the NPN or the like is not required to isolate from the substrate potential, resulting in the simplification of process steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Also, since the buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be formed in common to semiconductor elements such as bipolar and MOS transistors, no mask alignment for forming the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is required in the region to form the V-PNP. Therefore, the lowering of reliability of isolation from the substrate potential due to misalignment of the mask can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a trench structure as the structure for lateral element isolation, the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be formed simultaneously with a formation of the p-type isolation diffused layer (lower isolation layer), when isolation diffusion is used, or when the combination of trench isolation and isolation diffusion is used. Therefore, the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be formed without forming a special buried layer in the region for forming the V-PNP, and the buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> acting as the collector layer can be isolated surely from the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Next, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of this embodiment will be described below referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are schematic sectional views sequentially showing the process steps of manufacturing the semiconductor device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The process steps of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> described below are the steps of manufacturing a BiCMOS comprising a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor (V-PNP), as well as an npn-bipolar transistor (NPN), an NMOS transistor (NMOS), a PMOS transistor (PMOS), and a lateral pnp-transistor (L-PNP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a prescribed pattern acting as a mask is formed on a p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The region where the silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed becomes a substrate voltage-impressing region Sub (isolation diffused region) in subsequent steps. Thereafter, antimony (Sb) ions are implanted into the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> under the condition of an acceleration energy of 30 to 50 keV, and a dose of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 1000&deg; C. to 1200&deg; C. for 1 to 3 hours to activate. Thereby, a buried n<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-type layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed on the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, arsenic (As) ions may be implanted in place of antimony ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> resist film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> having openings is formed on the prescribed region by photolithography. The openings of the resist film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed in the region to impress the substrate voltage, and the region to form the V-PNP. Thereafter, boron (B) ions are implanted into the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using the resist film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as a mask under the condition of acceleration energy of 20 to 40 keV, and a dose of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Thereby, a buried p<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed in the region to form the V-PNP, and a p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> acting as a lower isolation layer is formed in the substrate voltage-impressing region. Similarly, a diffused layer similar to the p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed in the region for isolating between semiconductor elements adjacent to each other by diffused layers, as a lower isolation layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, epitaxial growth is performed to grow an n-type epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of a thickness of 1 to 3 &mgr;m, and a resistivity of 0.3 to 2 &OHgr;&middot;cm on the entire surface of the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, a TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) film (not shown) is formed, and the TEOS film is patterned to a mask pattern by photolithography followed by dry etching. Then, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> shows, etching is performed using the TEOS film as a mask to form trenches <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the boundary portions on the both sides of each region to form the NPN, the V-PNP, and the L-PNP. Thereafter, boron ions are implanted to form a surface inversion preventing layers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the lower layers (bottoms) of the trenches <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the inner wall surfaces of the trenches <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are oxidized to form silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (not shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), and the trenches <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are filled with polycrystalline silicon films <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Thereby, a trench element isolation structure for electrically isolating these regions is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, field oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is formed on the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the method known as LOCOS (local oxidation of silicon). More specifically, silicon nitride film is formed on the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by a CVD method, the silicon nitride film is patterned by photolithography followed by dry etching, and the silicon nitride film is removed from the region to form the field oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, heat treatment is carried out at a temperature of 900&deg; C. to 1200&deg; C. for 30 minutes to 1 hour to thermally oxidize the surface of the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to form the field oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, by the heat treatment for forming the field oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, boron ions in the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the region to form the V-PNP are diffused in the vertical direction. At this time, since boron, which is the impurity in the P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, has a large diffusion coefficient than antimony or arsenic, which are impurities in the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, only boron ions in the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are diffused in the vertical direction, while the depth of the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is unchanged. In other words, the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> floats above the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</cross-reference>. Thereby, since the p-type impurities present in the depth where the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed is diffused in the vertical direction, the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of a high concentration can be formed immediately above the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> above the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be used as the collector layer of the V-PNP. Also in the substrate voltage-impressing region, boron ions in the p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are diffused in the vertical direction, and boron ions in the p-type isolation diffused layer (lower isolation layer) formed by ion implantation of the same process as in the case of the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are also diffused in the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> resist film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having an opening is formed in the region to form the PMOS by photolithography. Then, an n-well <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed in the region to form the PMOS by implanting the ions of an n-type impurity using the resist film <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as the mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B, a</cross-reference> resist film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> having openings that correspond to prescribed areas on the region to form the NMOS, the substrate voltage-impressing region, and the region to form the V-PNP is formed. Then, by using the resist film <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as the mask, boron ions are implanted under the condition of an acceleration energy of 100 to 120 keV, and a dose of 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 10&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>,and the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 800&deg; C. to 1000&deg; C. for 30 to 60 minutes to activate. Thereby, a p-well <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> acting as an upper isolation layer, and a p-well <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are formed in the region to form the NMOS, the substrate voltage-impressing region, and the collector drawing portion of the region to form the V-PNP, respectively. Also in the region to electrically isolate between semiconductor elements adjacent to each other by diffused layers, a diffused layer same as the p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed as the upper isolation layer. The upper isolation layer (p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) is formed on the previously formed lower isolation layer (p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), and functions as an integrated p-type isolation diffused layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, gate electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed through gate oxide film on the region to form the NMOS and the region to form the PMOS. An electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be connected to the external base is formed so as to cover the prescribed area of the region to form the NPN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D, a</cross-reference> resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having openings that correspond to prescribed areas on the region to form the NPN, the region to form the NMOS, the region to form the V-PNP, and the region to form the L-PNP is formed. Then, using the resist film <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as the mask, arsenic (As) ions are implanted under the condition of an acceleration energy of 20 to 50 keV, and a dose of 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 800&deg; C. to 900&deg; C. for 30 to 60 minutes to activate. Thereby, a collector layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the NPN, source-drain diffused layers <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the NMOS, a base leader layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the V-PNP, and a base leader layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the L-PNP are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> resist film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having openings that correspond to prescribed areas on the region to form the NPN, the region to form the PMOS, the substrate voltage-impressing region, the region to form the V-PNP, and the region to form the L-PNP is formed. Then, boron ions or boron fluoride (BF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are implanted under the condition of an acceleration energy of 10 to 50 keV, and a dose of 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>14</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, to lower the resistance of the electrode <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be connected to the external base of NPN region. Also, a p-type source-drain diffused layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed in the region to form the PMOS; a p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed in the substrate voltage-impressing region; an emitter layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a collector leader layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are formed in the region to form the V-PNP; and an emitter layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a collector layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are formed in the region to form the L-PNP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are sequentially formed on the entire surface of the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and an opening for the base region is formed in the region to form the NPN by photolithography followed by dry etching. Thereafter, by using the silicon oxide films <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as the masks, boron fluoride is implanted to form a base layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the region to form the NPN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C, a</cross-reference> side wall is formed in the base region, and a polysilicon layer of a thickness of 1500 to 2000 angstrom acting as an emitter-drawing electrode is formed. Next arsenic (As) is implanted into the entire surface under the condition of an acceleration energy of 40 keV, and a dose of 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 1.6&times;10<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(5E15 to 1.6E16/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), and the polysilicon layer is patterned and the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment to form an emitter layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Next, an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed on the entire surface, and a contact hole is formed in the interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by photolithography followed by dry etching. Thereafter, an aluminum film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed by sputtering, and is patterned into a prescribed pattern by photolithography followed by dry etching. Thereby, a semiconductor device comprising NPN, NMOS, PMOS, V-PNP, and L-PNP, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the above-described process, since boron, which has a larger diffusion coefficient than the diffusion coefficient of antimony, which is the impurity in the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is implanted as the impurity in the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be formed above the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the ion implantation of antimony and boron followed by heat treatment, due to difference in diffusion coefficients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram showing the laminated state of each layer on the p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed, and the concentration of impurities at various depths from the topmost surface. Here, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows the state where antimony (Sb) ions and boron (B) ions are implanted into a p-type silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the steps of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows the state where a field oxide film <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> has been formed and subjected to heat treatment by the step of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, after the growth of the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the step of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, immediately after antimony ions and boron ions are implanted under the conditions of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the concentration peaks of antimony and boron in the depth direction are present at substantially the same depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> After the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has been formed and subjected to heat treatment, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows, antimony, which has a smaller diffusion coefficient, is not diffused significantly in the depth direction, and forms the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the depth where the ions are initially implanted. On the other hand, boron, which has a larger diffusion coefficient than that of antimony, is diffused vertically, and forms buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on and under the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> adhering to the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be formed on the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, as described above, since impurities that has a larger diffusion coefficient than the diffusion coefficient of the impurity in the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used as the p-type impurity for the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be surely formed on the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by thermally diffusing the impurities of the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> after the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of a high concentration is formed in common in the regions to form various transistors. Thereby, the collector layer can be isolated from the substrate potential without forming a specific buried layer, for example, a special buried n-layer, in the region to form the vertical bipolar transistor. Therefore, a semiconductor device, such as BiCMOS, comprising various elements, such as an npn-bipolar transistor and a MOS transistor, can be manufactured in a simple process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Also, since the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can be formed on the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> after the buried N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed evenly in the regions where these various element have been formed, without special mask alignment, the region to form the vertical pnp-bipolar transistor can be prevented from expanding due to mask alignment, and further downsizing of the device can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In addition, a lower isolation layer (p-type diffused layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) of the isolation diffused layer for isolating between the regions to form various transistors can be formed together with the buried P<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the number of process steps can be reduced particularly for manufacturing a bipolar integrated circuit to isolate elements by isolation diffusion, resulting in the reduction of the manufacturing costs. Also by combining trench isolation, improvement of the reliability of element isolation can further be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Constituted as described above, the present invention exerts effects as shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In a semiconductor device comprising a vertical pnp-bipolar transistor in a prescribed element region, by forming a p-type collector layer so as to adhere onto an n-type buried layer of a high concentration, the n-type buried layer can isolate the collector layer from the substrate potential. Also, by forming the p-type collector layer on the n-type buried layer, the p-type collector layer can be formed without special mask alignment, and the further downsizing of the device can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Since the diffusion coefficient of the impurity in the collector layer is selected to be larger than the diffusion coefficient of the impurity in the n-type buried layer, the impurities in the collector layer can be diffused on the n-type buried layer by heat treatment after the impurities are implanted in the n-type buried layer and the collector layer. Thereby, the p-type collector layer can be surely formed on the n-type buried layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The n-type buried layer formed in common in element regions other than the region to form the pnp-bipolar transistor can be used as the collector layer of the npn-bipolar transistor, or for isolation from the substrate potential. Therefore, in a semiconductor device comprising a pnp-bipolar transistor and other elements such as an npn-bipolar transistor, the manufacturing process can be simplified, and the manufacturing costs can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> By providing an isolation diffused layer for electrically isolating element regions, and forming a collector layer as the same layer at least as the lower portion of the isolation diffused layer, the collector layer can be formed at the same time as the formation of the isolation diffused layer. Thereby, the manufacturing process can be simplified, and the manufacturing costs can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> By further providing trench element isolation for electrically isolating element regions, isolation between element regions can be ensured, and the reliability of the device can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may by practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The entire disclosure of a Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-200423, filed on Jul. 2, 2001 including specification, claims, drawings and summary, on which the Convention priority of the present application is based, are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
