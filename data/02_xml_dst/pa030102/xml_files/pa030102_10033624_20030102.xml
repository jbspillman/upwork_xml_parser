<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a human powered exercise scooter. More particularly, the invention allows a standing user to power the wheeled scooter by moving stabilized pedals with the feet along a closed loop arcuate curve to drive at least one wheel of the scooter. Further, steering, hand brake and stunt features are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The traditional kick scooter comprises a pair of small wheels, steering and a platform to support at least one foot. Propulsion is achieved by pushing the scooter with one foot in contact with the ground while the other foot remains on the platform. While this type scooter is popular today among youngsters, the scooter is slow as a means of transport with a bumpy ride and tends to exercise one leg differently than the other. Whitson et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,089 shows a scooter having larger wheels to improve the speed and comfort of a kick scooter. Rappaport in U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,331 adds a second foot board to the kick scooter for better support. Grutzik in U.S. Pat. No. 5,899,474 shows a velocipede type scooter using an eccentrically mounted front wheel in an attempt to enhance kick propulsion of a scooter. Dickson in U.S. Pat. No. 5,992,864 shows a scooter having larger wheels adapted from a bicycle. Tsai in U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,044 offers a foldable rollerboard as a scooter variation. All of this prior art, use kick propulsion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Additional forms of human propulsion have also been tried for land transport. Chase in U.S. Pat. No. 4,053,173, Titcomb in U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,566, Bortolin in U.S. Pat. No. 4,456,276 and Schirrmacher in U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,318 use varying forms of up and down swing arms to propel scooters and bicycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The classic bicycle crank remains the most popular means to propel a bicycle for a seated user. However, freely rotating pedals do not provide sufficient support for mostly standup operation. The use of stabilized pedals as a means for propulsion start to appear with Boyd in U.S. Pat. No. 1,323,004 where a bicycle crank is adapted with an elongate pedal connected to the crank and to a rocker link pivoted at the rear of the bicycle for increased crank leverage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Nickey in U.S. Pat. No 1,273,906 places the feet on a pair of elongate pedals connected to both a crank and a rocker link to drive a wagon. Walter in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,557,634 and 1,617,357 shows a three wheeled scooter having foot platforms that rest on a roller in the front and drive a crank attached to the wheels in the rear. Stienbarber et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,110,148 shows a three wheeled scooter having foot platforms that drive a crank attached to a pair of wheels. Another three wheeled scooter is shown by Benjamin in U.S. Pat. No. 1,977,035 that has a pair of foot platforms that drive the rear wheels. Yang in U.S. Pat. No. 4,779,868 shows a pair of pedals on a scooter type device that swing up and down to drive the front wheel. Geschwender in U.S. Pat. No. 5,630,774 offers an exercise apparatus similar to a scooter having three wheels and pedals connected to both a crank and a rocker link pivoted over the rear wheel. None of this prior art address a stabilized pedal for propulsion that fully supports the heel of the foot during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Brockman in U.S. Pat. No. 2,641,249 offers a stationary exercise cycle having a pedal braced to foot and upper leg during seated exercise. Eschenbach in U.S. Pat. No. 5,279,529 shows stabilized pedal platforms that maintains heel support for standing exercise and proposes a variation for bicycle propulsion. Rodgers, Jr. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,527,246 and 5,611,757 shows a mobile exercise apparatus having a pedal supported by complex linkage to follow a running motion as a means for propulsion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The addition of a third wheel or roller has been known for quite some time on bicycles as a safety feature to prevent excessive elevation of the front wheel. Matthews in U.S. Pat. No. 634,062 shows a spring loaded third wheel added to a bicycle. Stuart et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 1,472,375 shows a pair of rollers added to a scooter to aid in the safe elevation of the front wheel. Banks in U.S. Pat. No. 1,537,729 and Marasco in U.S. Pat. No. 3,427,037 show a third wheel added to a wheeled toy horse for safer rearing. Wyman et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,765,871 shows a tricycle for front wheel elevation. Hansen in U.S. Pat. No. 3,284,096 shows a roller added to a bicycle to allow safer front wheel elevation. Howard in U.S. Pat. No. 3,653,679 offers a third wheel with extra seat for front wheel elevation. Thereafter, a variety of one or more wheels are offered as safety features by Moore in U.S. Pat. No. 4,012,054, Parrilla in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,997,185 and 3,888,511, Wilson et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,153,268, Newman in U.S. Pat. No. 4,154,452 and Young in U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,323. The term &ldquo;Wheelie&rdquo; is used with the addition of rollers to bicycles in U.S. Pat. No. 4,367,883, Sutton in U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,221, Smith in U.S. Pat. No. D366,636 and Long in U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,179. In each example, the rider shifts body weight while remaining seated or on the pedals to elevate the front wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The use of a step to mount a bicycle is shown by Benfield in U.S. Pat. No. 374,287. Arico provides a step that can be used to propel a bicycle in wheelie mode as a kick scooter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> None of this prior art offers a means for scooter propulsion that enhances the circular movement of a crank and fully supports the feet of a standing operator that allows the user to perform certain tricks. Hence, the need exists for an exercise exercise scooter having stabilized pedals that fully support both feet of a standing operator and drive a crank to propel a wheel while allowing the user to perform certain tricks or stunts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is one objective of the present invention to provide stabilized pedals which follow a closed loop elongate curve that drives at least one wheel of an exercise exercise scooter. Another objective of this invention is to curve the pedal end for better heel support. Another objective of this invention is to provide a grinder bar allowing the user to elevate the scooter to be supported underneath by a stationary rail as a stunt. Another objective of this invention is to incorporate a step attached to the frame for foot support that allows another trick. Yet another objective of this invention is to provide a frame extension with foot pegs to allow easy wheelies for a novice rider. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a wheeled exercise scooter having pedals for propulsion that can be used for exercise and to perform certain tricks or stunts. Pedals are provided that follow an orbital movement to propel the exercise scooter. Various features are added to the frame to facilitate certain stunts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, a frame capable of supporting a user is adapted for at least two wheels in contact with the ground. A first wheel is rotatably connected to a fork that is rotatably connected to the frame for steering. A handlebar extends upward from the fork to support the hands. The handlebar can be folded to lower the height of the scooter for stowage or transport. A second wheel is rotatably connected to the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A crank is rotatably connected to the frame positioned adjacent the second wheel and protrudes on either side. The crank and second wheel are engaged with sprockets and a chain to form a drive coupling. A pair of foot support members having foot engaging pedals with curved ends are pivotally connected to the crank intermediate the ends. The curved ends provide better heel support in the upper positions of the pedals. A pair of guides in the form of rocker links are pivotally connected to the frame positioned adjacent the first wheel. The other end of the foot support member is pivotally connected to the rocker link. Hand brakes are adapted to the first and second wheels and connected to a brake levers on the handlebar by cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Application of alternating body weight on the stabilized pedals with the feet cause the crank to rotate and propel the second wheel with the drive coupling. Since the pedal angles are predetermined to maintain the heel upon the pedals, full body weight can safely be applied to the pedals with the heel of the foot in contact with the curved portion of the pedals for efficient power transfer to the second wheel. Once cruising speed has been reached, the feet may be repositioned more forward where the toe contacts the toe stop for easy pedaling to maintain speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A grinder bar is attached to the frame generally horizontal positioned below the bearing housing for the crank. The grinder bar allows the exercise scooter to be raised off the ground to be supported by a rail during operation as a rail stunt. A step is attached to the frame positioned above the crank bearing housing. The step provides foot support other than the pedals for trick riding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A frame extension extends to the rear of the exercise scooter to support one or more rollers. When the front wheel is elevated, the rollers contact the ground preventing a further rise in the front wheel. Foot pegs are positioned between the axle of the rear wheel and rollers. When body weight is moved to the foot pegs, the front wheel is elevated and the rollers make contact with the ground. This stunt is referred to as a &ldquo;wheelie&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Application of body weight on the pedal provides propulsion similar to a bicycle. Pedaling may be continued while using a seat (not shown). The step can be used for foot support during the rail stunt. Foot pegs are available for the wheelie stunt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Coasting is comfortable when the pedals are positioned generally parallel to allow support for each foot. A one way clutch in the second wheel allows the pedals to be reversed to the coasting mode or positioned for easy starting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In summary, this invention provides the user with pedal operation with little or no impact to the body to propel an exercise scooter. The curved pedal ends assure a stable foot position during the downward power stroke. Certain stunts are easier to achieve with the addition of the grinder bar, step and frame extension with foot pegs. </paragraph>
