<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method for exchanging tape cartridges between two automated tape cartridge libraries. A carriage assembly carries cartridges back and forth between the libraries. The carriage assembly includes a cartridge transport cell, has a vertical axis, and cooperates with pass through ports in the libraries for providing access to tape cartridge storage cells in the libraries. A guide structure extends between the libraries for supporting the carriage assembly. The guide structure defines a linear path and has first and second sides substantially parallel to the linear path which define an envelope. The carriage assembly is driven along the guide structure, and automatically rotates about the substantially vertical axis. The cartridge transport cell is accessible by robotic devices in the libraries when the carriage assembly is aligned with the pass through ports. The carriage assembly rotates substantially within the envelope as it is driven along the guide structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the exchange of tape cartridges between tape cartridge libraries and, more particularly, to a system and method for exchanging tape cartridges between automated tape cartridge libraries linked in a library system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Current automated libraries for tape cartridges typically include arrays of multiple storage cells housing the tape cartridges, as well as multiple media drives. Multiple automated robotic devices may be used to move tape cartridges between the various storage cells and media drives within a library. The use of multiple robotic devices raises various problems concerning the distribution of power to such robotic devices. In prior art automated tape cartridge libraries, the movement of the robotic devices is restricted by wire cable connections used for providing such power. Such cabling can prevent the robotic devices from crossing paths, or from continuous movement in one direction around the library without the necessity of ultimately reversing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such problems can be overcome through the use of power distribution strips or rails. A robotic device traveling over a given route may used fixed conductive strips or rails to supply power to the robotic device, which itself is provided with brushes or wheels that contact the conductive strips or rails in order to conduct power to the robotic device. The integration of such conductive strips or rails into the automated tape cartridge library, in conjunction with brush or wheel contacts provided on the robotic devices, allows for greater freedom of movement of the robotic devices. Moreover, such power distribution systems also provide for modular and extensible power distribution to robotic devices as library configurations change, or as libraries are connected in a modular fashion to form library systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In that regard, a number of relatively large automated tape cartridge libraries are known having, for example, between 1000 and 2500 cartridge storage cells. Relatively smaller automated tape cartridge libraries, having for example on the order of 700 cartridge storage cells, are also known. For some users, as storage requirements increase, a smaller automated tape cartridge library may have to be replaced with a larger automated library, often at considerable expense. As a result, there exists a need to allow such smaller automated libraries to be linked together to create larger library systems having, for example, on the order of 1400 cartridge storage cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is known to link the above described larger automated libraries using a variety of pass-through ports and cartridge exchange mechanisms. For example, to ensure maximum access to data stored in the tape cartridges, multiple paths are created between larger automated libraries that employ cam or screw driven cartridge exchange devices. As such devices are located entirely or substantially within a library, little floor space in a data center is compromised by the device. However, the use of multiple paths and interior cartridge exchange devices result in the loss of a large number of cartridge storage cells in each library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, multiple larger automated libraries can be linked linearly to improve access to data. In such configurations, gravity driven cartridge exchange devices are employed between linked libraries. In operation, a tape cartridge is delivered to the cartridge exchange device by a robotic device in one of the libraries. The weight of the cartridge causes the exchange device to rotate and deliver the cartridge to the linked library, where it can be retrieved by another robotic device in that library. This configuration does not result in the loss of large number of storage cells in each library, and only minimally affects floor space. However, only a single cartridge may be passed at a time and, because the exchange device is gravity driven, another path must be provided to exchange cartridges in the opposite direction between the linked libraries. Moreover, more complex host software which sees the linked libraries as a single library, such as Automated Cartridge System Library Server (ACSLS), may be required to control the multiple linked libraries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The pass-through ports and cartridge exchange mechanisms used in linking the relatively larger automated libraries, however, are not suitable for use in linking the relatively smaller automated libraries in that they do not meet the form factors (e.g., orientation, floor space) required by users needing 1400 cartridge storage cells. Moreover, pass-through ports and cartridge exchange devices that result in the loss of large numbers of cartridge storage cells are unacceptable because such a loss represents a significant percentage of storage space in such smaller libraries. Still further, the development of new tape cartridges having differing weights raises concerns as to the ability of gravity driven cartridge exchange devices to reliably transfer all types of cartridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Thus, there exist a need for an improved cartridge exchange mechanism for use in linked automated libraries. Such an improved mechanism would preferably minimize the number of storage cells that may be lost as a result of linking automated libraries, as well as preferably minimize the amount of space required for linking such libraries. Such an improved mechanism would also preferably be capable of reliably transferring a wide variety of cartridge types. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With reference to the Figures, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in greater detail. The present application incorporates by reference herein commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. ______ (Attorney Docket No. 2001-047-TAP), ______ (Attorney Docket No. 2001-048-TAP), (Attorney Docket No. 2001-049-TAP), ______ (Attorney Docket No. 2001-050-TAP;), and ______ (Attorney Docket No. 2001-100-TAP), all filed on the same date as the present application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As previously noted, current automated libraries for tape cartridges typically include arrays of multiple storage cells housing the tape cartridges, as well as multiple media drives. Multiple automated robotic devices may be used to move tape cartridges between the various storage cells and media drives within a library. As also noted previously, the use of multiple robotic devices raises various problems concerning the distribution of power thereto. In prior art automated tape cartridge libraries, the movement of the robotic devices is restricted by wire cable connections used for providing such power. Such cabling can prevent the robotic devices from crossing paths, or from continuous movement in one direction around the library without the necessity of ultimately reversing direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Such problems can be overcome through the use of power distribution strips or rails. A robotic device traveling over a given route may used fixed conductive strips or rails to supply power to the robotic device, which itself is provided with brushes or wheels that contact the conductive strips or rails in order to conduct power to the robotic device. The integration of such power distribution strips or rails into the automated tape cartridge library, in conjunction with brush or wheel contacts provided on the robotic devices, allows for greater freedom of movement of the robotic devices, as well as for modular and extensible power distribution to robotic devices as library configurations change, or as libraries are connected in a modular fashion to form library systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In that regard, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show perspective and cross-sectional views, respectively, of a robotic device for use in an automated tape cartridge library having brush and strip power distribution. As seen therein, a moveable robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), which may be referred to as a &ldquo;handbot&rdquo; or &ldquo;picker,&rdquo; is supported by a guide structure or rail (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) preferably having an integrated power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Guide rail (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and/or power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may also be referred to as a track. Power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) preferably comprises back-to-back conductive surfaces (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B), preferably copper, separated by a dielectric (preferably FR4) in a sandwich-like configuration. Power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may be a printed circuit board wherein copper conductors are laminated, glued or etched onto a substrate material. Alternatively, power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may comprise copper foil tape glued or laminated onto plastic material, or copper inserts molded into a moldable plastic material. Any other methods of construction or configurations known to those of ordinary skill may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) includes brush contacts (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) for providing power to robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). In that regard, the back-to-back conductive surfaces (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B) of power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) are oppositely charged. An upper brush (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A) in contact with one conductive surface (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A), in conjunction with a corresponding lower brush (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B) in contact with the opposite conductive surface (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B) thereby supply power to the robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). Brushes (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) are contained in housing assembly (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and, to ensure that contact between brushes (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is maintained, brushes (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) are spring loaded (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). Multiple or redundant pairs of such upper and lower brushes (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) are preferably provided, and preferably spring loaded (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) independently, to improve robustness and reliability in the event of a brush failure, momentary loss of contact at one or more brushes due to any track irregularities, including seams or joints therein, or voltage irregularities between adjacent power strips (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Moreover, brushes (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) preferably have a circular cross-section, such as is provided by a cylindrical shaped brush (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), as these are better able to traverse a joint or seam (<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) in the power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), which may more readily impede or catch a square shaped brush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Power supplied to robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) through power strip (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and brushes (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) powers a motor (not shown) in robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), which in turn drives a belt and gear system (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). Guide rails (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) includes teeth (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) which cooperate with belt and gear system (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) to permit robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) to move back and forth along guide rails (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) via guide wheels (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) may thereby gain access to tape cartridges stored in library cells (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) located adjacent guide rail (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, various perspective, side and cross-sectional views of a robotic device for use in an automated tape cartridge library having brush and wheel power distribution are shown. As seen therein, in this alternative embodiment, robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) is supported by a guide rail (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), which is provided with a pair of oppositely charged power conductors (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), preferably in the form of copper rails. Power rails (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) supply power to robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) through power transmission carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). Power supplied to robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) via power rails (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and power transmission carriage (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) powers a motor (not shown), which in turn drives belt and gear mechanism (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) to permit robotic device (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) to move back and forth along guide rail (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) via guide wheels (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Power transmission carriage (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) includes multiple cooperating pairs of conduction wheels (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) (preferably copper), the individual members of a cooperating pair provided in contact, respectively, with oppositely charged conductor rails (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Conductive brushes (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) are provided to contact conduction wheels (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and are spring loaded (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), preferably independently, to maintain such contact. To maintain contact between conduction wheels (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and conductor rails (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), power transmission carriage (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) also includes vertical pre-load spring (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). Power transmission carriage (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) still further includes gimbal arm (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) with pivot shaft (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) and pivot screw (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) for carriage compliance. Once again, multiple or redundant conduction wheel (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) and conductive brush (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) pairs are preferably provided, and preferably spring loaded (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) independently, to improve robustness and reliability in the event of a brush failure, momentary loss of contact at one or more wheels due to any track irregularities, including seams or joints therein, or voltage irregularities between adjacent power rails (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). In that same regard, while a single vertical pre-load spring (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) is shown, each conduction wheel (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) could also be independently spring loaded to maintain contact with conductor rails (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), thereby allowing for better negotiation of any track irregularities or imperfections, including joints or seams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As previously described, a number of relatively large automated tape cartridge libraries are known having, for example, between 1000 and 2500 cartridge storage cells. Relatively smaller automated tape cartridge libraries, having for example on the order of 700 cartridge storage cells, are also known. For some users, as storage requirements increase, a smaller automated tape cartridge library may have to be replaced with a larger automated library, often at considerable expense. As a result, there exists a need to allow such smaller automated libraries to be linked together to create larger library systems having, for example, on the order of 1400 cartridge storage cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In that regard, it is known to link the above described larger automated libraries using a variety of pass-through ports and cartridge exchange mechanisms. For example, to ensure maximum access to data stored in the tape cartridges, multiple paths are created between larger automated libraries that employ cam or screw driven cartridge exchange devices. As such devices are located entirely or substantially within a library, little floor space in a data center is compromised by the device. However, the use of multiple paths and interior cartridge exchange devices result in the loss of a large number of cartridge storage cells (e.g., 24) in each library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, multiple larger automated libraries can be linked linearly to improve access to data. In such configurations, gravity driven cartridge exchange devices are employed between linked libraries. In operation, a tape cartridge is delivered to the cartridge exchange device by a robotic device in one of the libraries. The weight of the cartridge causes the exchange device to rotate and deliver the cartridge to the linked library, where it can be retrieved by another robotic device in that library. This configuration does not result in the loss of large number of storage cells (e.g., 4) in each library, and only minimally affects floor space. However, only a single cartridge may be passed at a time and, because the exchange device is gravity driven, another path must be provided to exchange cartridges in the opposite direction between the linked libraries. Moreover, more complex host software which sees the linked libraries as a single library, such as Automated Cartridge System Library Server (ACSLS), may be required to control the multiple linked libraries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The pass-through ports and cartridge exchange mechanisms used in linking the relatively larger automated libraries, however, are not suitable for use in linking the relatively smaller automated libraries in that they do not meet the form factors (e.g., orientation, floor space) required by users needing 1400 cartridge storage cells. Moreover, pass-through ports and cartridge exchange devices that result in the loss of large numbers of cartridge storage cells are unacceptable because such a loss represents a significant percentage of storage space in such smaller libraries. Still further, the development of new tape cartridges having differing weights raises concerns as to the ability of gravity driven cartridge exchange devices to reliably transfer all types of cartridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As a result, as previously discussed, there exists a need for an improved cartridge exchange mechanism for linking automated libraries. Such an improved mechanism would preferably minimize the number of storage cells that may be lost as a result of linking automated libraries, as well as preferably minimize the amount of space required for linking such libraries. Such an improved mechanism would also preferably be capable of reliably transferring a wide variety of cartridge types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, perspective and exploded views of the cartridge exchange device for use in an automated tape cartridge library system according to the present invention is shown. Such a device is preferably for use in exchanging tape cartridges between two linked automated libraries having, for example, 700 cartridge storage cells each. In that regard, referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, top, perspective and exploded views of the cartridge transport device installed between two such automated tape cartridge libraries according to the present invention are shown. As seen therein, and with continuing reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, cartridge exchange device (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) preferably comprises a carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) for transporting tape cartridges between automated libraries (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). Carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) is preferably provided with capacity for two tape cartridges, having two tape transport cells (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In contrast to prior art cam or screw driven cartridge exchange devices which require extremely tight tolerances and expensive components, and which must be installed and set-up to meet specific distance requirements between libraries, device (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is preferably motor and belt driven (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) and self-calibrated to ensure robust design. Motor and belt (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>) drive carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) back and forth between libraries (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) along guide structure (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). In operation, carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) is originally located at one end of guide structure (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) adjacent a pass-through port or window (not shown) in one library (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), which may be referred to as a &ldquo;home&rdquo; position. One or two tape cartridges to be transported from library (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) to library (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) are delivered and inserted into transport cells (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) by a robotic device (not shown) within library (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) through the window (not shown). As carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) is driven along guide structure (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) toward library (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) to complete the exchange, rack and pinion gears (<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) operate to cause carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) to rotate approximately 180&deg; so that transport cells (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) face a pass-through port or window (not shown) in library (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). Upon arrival of carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) at library (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>), which may be referred to as an &ldquo;away&rdquo; position, the one or more tape cartridges in transport cells (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) are retrieved by one or more robotic devices (not shown) within library (<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) through the window (not shown). The use of such rack and pinion gears (<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) permits carriage assembly (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) to rotate in a relatively small space, allowing device (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) to operate within the form factors, particularly floor space, required by users of such library systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> depicts a partial perspective view of an array of multiple cartridge storage cells (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) in the interior of an automated tape cartridge library. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> depicts a partial perspective view of an array of multiple cartridge storage cells (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) in the interior of an automated tape cartridge library (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) having an installed cartridge exchange device (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) according to the present inventions. As seen from those figures, as well as from FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the linear transport path of device (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) between libraries (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) results in minimal loss of cartridge storage cells (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, only six such storage cells (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) are lost per library (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>), although device (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) occupies the space of only three such storage cells (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> also shows the narrow pass-through port or window (<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>) required for operation of device (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>), again limiting the loss of storage cells (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) and increasing tape cartridge density within libraries (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>). Moreover, as device (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) is not gravity driven, it can reliably transport all types of tape cartridges and need not be fine tuned in light of the development of new cartridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> simplified, exemplary flowchart depicting the method of the present invention is shown, denoted generally by reference numeral <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The method (<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) is for exchanging tape cartridges between first and second libraries and is provided for use in an automated tape cartridge library system having a first library and a second library, each of the first and second libraries having a plurality of storage cells for housing tape cartridges and a robotic device for moving the tape cartridges in the library. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the method (<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) comprises providing a carriage assembly for carrying tape cartridges from the first library to the second library and from the second library to the first library, the carriage assembly comprising at least one cartridge transport cell, wherein the carriage assembly has a substantially vertical axis and is adapted to cooperate with a first pass through port in the first library for providing access to the plurality of storage cells in the first library and a second pass through port in the second library for providing access to the plurality of storage cells in the second library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The method (<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) further comprises providing a guide structure extending between the first and second libraries for supporting the carriage assembly, the guide structure defining a linear path and having first and second sides substantially parallel to the linear path, the first and second sides defining an envelope. The method (<highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) still further comprises providing means for driving the carriage assembly along the guide structure between the first and second pass through ports, and providing means for rotating the carriage assembly about the substantially vertical axis, wherein the at least one cartridge transport cell is accessible by the robotic device of the first library when the carriage assembly is aligned with the first pass through port, the rotating means automatically rotates the carriage assembly substantially within the envelope as the driving means drives the carriage assembly along the guide structure between the first and second libraries, and the at least one cartridge transport cell is accessible by the robotic device of the second library when the carriage assembly is aligned with the second pass through port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the simplified flowchart depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is exemplary of the method of the present invention. In that regard, the steps of such method may be executed in sequences other than those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, including the execution of one or more steps simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Thus it is apparent that the present invention provides an improved cartridge exchange mechanism for linking automated libraries. In that regard, the cartridge exchange device of the present invention minimizes the number of storage cells that may be lost as a result of linking automated libraries, as well as minimizes the amount of space required for linking such libraries. The cartridge exchange device of the present invention is further capable of reliably transferring a wide variety of cartridge types. </paragraph>
