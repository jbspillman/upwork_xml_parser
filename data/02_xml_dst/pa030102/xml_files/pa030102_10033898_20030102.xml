<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows an abnormal operation of excessive lighting during the sustaining period Ts. A case where a pair of the electrodes Xn and Yn is address-designated and a pair of the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and a pair of the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are not address-designated is shown. When the plasma display is in normal operation, a discharge is generated between the address-designated electrodes Xn and Yn. As a result, the display cell with the electrodes Xn and Yn is lighted, and the display cell with the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and the display cell with the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are not lighted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In some cases, however, the display cells are not completely initialized due to poor initialization or the like during the reset period Tr (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Consequently, an unnecessary wall charge sometimes remains at the electrode Yn&minus;1 or Xn&plus;1. Thereby, a discharge is erroneously generated between the electrodes Yn and Xn&plus;1 or between the electrodes Xn and Yn&minus;1. As a result, a discharge is generated between the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 or between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, whereby unnecessary excessive lighting occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows an abnormal operation in which a display cell which should be lighted is not lighted during the sustaining period Ts. A case where the pair of the electrodes Xn and Yn, the pair of the Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, and the pair of the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are address-designated is shown. When the plasma display is in normal operation, all of the display cell with the electrodes Xn and Yn, the display cell with the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, and the display cell with the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are lighted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In some cases, however, the display cells are not completely initialized due to poor initialization or the like during the reset period Tr (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). As a result, although discharges should be originally generated between the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 and between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, discharges are sometimes erroneously generated between the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn and between the electrodes Yn&minus;1 and Xn. Consequently, an abnormal operation, in which the display cell with the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 and the display cell with the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 are not lighted, occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With the advance of high definition of the plasma display and an increase in the number of pixels, the adjacent display cells come closer to each other, and the influence of discharge interference increases, whereby the aforementioned problems remarkably arise. Although the ribs <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> are provided between the addressing electrodes Aj in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, partitions are not provided in the vertical direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and hence discharge interference in the vertical direction is prone to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Generally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the interval of a slit between the electrodes Xn and Yn between which a sustaining discharge is generated is narrowed, and the interval of a slit between the electrodes Yn and Xn&plus;1 (Yn&minus;1 and Xn) between which a sustaining discharge is not generated is widened, whereby discharges are separated, but when high definition advances as described above, the interval between the adjacent display cells can not be fully secured. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a plasma display capable of a stable sustaining discharge by a reduction in the influence of adjacent display cells and a method of driving the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a plasma display, wherein a plurality of first display electrodes and a plurality of second display electrodes are arranged in parallel with one another, and a plurality of addressing electrodes are arranged to intersect the first and the second display electrodes, and wherein a driver for applying a potential lower than an anode potential and higher than a cathode potential to the first and the second display electrode adjacent to the first and the second display electrode between which a sustaining discharge is generated when the sustaining discharge is generated between the first and the second display electrode by applying the anode potential to one of the first and the second display electrode and the cathode potential to the other thereof is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> By applying the anode potential to one of the first and the second display electrode and the cathode potential to the other thereof, the sustaining discharge can be generated between the first and the second display electrode. On this occasion, by applying the potential lower than the anode potential and higher than the cathode potential to the first and the second display electrode adjacent to the first and the second electrode between which the sustaining discharge is generated, a display cell in which the sustaining discharge is generated can prevent a bad influence from a display cell adjacent thereto. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The structure of the display cell Cij is the same as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view of a progressive mode plasma display. A display cell with a common electrode Xn&minus;1 and a scanning electrode Yn&minus;1, a display cell with a common electrode Xn and a scanning electrode Yn, and a display cell with a common electrode Xn&plus;1 and a scanning electrode Yn&plus;1 are formed on a glass substrate <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the progressive mode, intervals between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, the electrodes Xn and Yn, and the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 which respectively form pairs composing display cells are narrow, and hence discharge is possible. Intervals between the electrodes Yn&minus;1 and Xn, and the electrodes Yn and Xn&plus;1 which lie across different display cells are wide, and hence discharge is not generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Concerning a more detailed art of the progressive mode, an art disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,288,692 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 10-207420, FR2758641) is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a timing chart showing a method of driving the progressive mode plasma display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> First, during a reset period Tr, predetermined voltages are respectively applied between the scanning electrodes Yi and the common electrodes Xi to perform overall write and overall erase of charges, erase previous display contents, and form predetermined wall charges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, during an addressing period Ta, a pulse having a positive potential Va is applied to the addressing electrode Aj, and pulses <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> having a cathode potential Vsb is applied to desired scanning electrodes Yn&minus;1, Yn, Yn&plus;1, and so on sequentially by scanning. By these pulses <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, addressing discharges are generated between the addressing electrode Aj and the scanning electrodes Yn&minus;1, Yn, and Yn&plus;1, and the display cells are address-designated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, during a sustaining period (sustaining discharge period) Ts, opposite phase voltage is applied between the common electrodes Xi and the scanning electrodes Yi, whereby between the common electrode Xi and the scanning electrode Yi which correspond to the display cell address-designated during the addressing period Ta, a sustaining discharge is generated, and the display cell glows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> More specifically, at a point in time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a cathode potential Vsb is applied to the common electrode Xn in an even-numbered line, and an anode potential Vsa is applied to the scanning electrode Yn in an even-numbered line. Thereby, high voltage is applied between the common electrode Xn and the scanning electrode Yn to generate a sustaining discharge <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, a potential Vsc (for example, ground (GND)) is applied to the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 in odd-numbered lines adjacent to the electrodes Xn and Yn in even-numbered lines between which the sustaining discharge is generated. The potential Vsc is an intermediate potential ((Vsa&plus;Vsb)/2) between the anode potential Vsa and the cathode potential Vsb. Incidentally, the potential Vsc needs only to be lower than the anode potential Vsa and higher than the cathode potential Vsb. Consequently, the electrodes Xn and Yn can generate the stable discharge <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> without receiving a bad influence from the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at a point in time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the anode potential Vsa is applied to the common electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Xn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines, and the cathode potential Vsb is applied to the scanning electrodes Yn&minus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines. Thereby, high voltage is applied between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and between the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 to generate sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, the potential Vsc (GND) is applied to the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines adjacent to the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines which generate the sustaining discharges. Consequently, the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 can generate the stable discharges <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> without receiving a bad influence from the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Then, at a point in time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the anode potential Vsa is applied to the common electrode Xn in the even-numbered line, and the cathode potential Vsb is applied to the scanning electrode Yn in the even-numbered line. Thereby, high voltage is applied between the common electrode Xn and the scanning electrode Yn to generate a sustaining discharge <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, by applying the potential Vsc (GND) to the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines adjacent to the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines which generate the sustaining discharge, the electrodes Xn and Yn can generate the stable discharge <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> without receiving a bad influence from the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at a point in time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the cathode potential Vsb is applied to the common electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Xn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines, and the anode potential Vsa is applied to the scanning electrodes Yn&minus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines. Thereby, high voltage is applied between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and between the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 to generate sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, by applying the potential Vsc to the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines adjacent to the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines which generate the sustaining discharges, the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 can generate the stable discharges <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> without receiving a bad influence from the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Hereafter, the operations from the point in time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the point in time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are repeated. In this embodiment, the sustaining discharge between the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines and the sustaining discharges between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, and Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines are alternately generated. The aforementioned even-numbered lines and odd-numbered lines may be reversed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a state at the point in time <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. An explanation is given with a case where a pair of the electrodes Xn and Yn is address-designated and a pair of the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and a pair of the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are not address-designated as an example. Hitherto, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, there sometimes occurs a malfunction in which not only the display cell with the electrodes Xn and Yn is lighted but also the display cell with the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and the display cell with the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are lighted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, the anode potential Vsa and the cathode potential Vsb are respectively applied to the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines, and the potential Vsc is applied to the electrodes Xn&minus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines. Consequently, the display cells in the even-numbered lines can generate sustaining discharges without receiving a bad influence from the display cells in the odd-numbered lines adjacent thereto. Namely, the electrodes Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and so on in the odd-numbered lines have the intermediate potential Vsc, whereby excessive discharges between the electrodes Xn and Yn&minus;1 and between the electrodes Yn and Xn&plus;1 can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the electrode Xn&plus;1 has the anode potential Vsa, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, excessive discharge is caused between the electrodes Yn and Xn&plus;1. Moreover, assuming that the electrode Xn&plus;1 has the cathode potential Vsb, the electrodes Yn and Xn&plus;1 are regarded as the same electrode, and consequently sustaining discharges are caused between the electrodes Xn, Yn, and Xn&plus;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, a case where the pair of the electrodes Xn and Yn, the pair of the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, and the pair of the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are address-designated will be explained. Hitherto, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the display cell with the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and the display cell with the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are not sometimes lighted erroneously. According to this embodiment, when the anode potential Vsa and the cathode potential Vsb are respectively applied to the common electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Xn&plus;1 and the scanning electrodes Yn&minus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines, the intermediate potential Vsc is applied to the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines, whereby the display cells in the odd-numbered lines and even-numbered lines can be stably lighted respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Since the stable sustaining discharge of a display cell without a bad influence from adjacent display cells is possible in this embodiment, the definition of the plasma display and an increase in the number of pixels can be attained. In this case, adjacent display cells come close to each other, but stable sustaining discharge is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows other waveforms during the sustaining period Ts in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Points in time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> correspond to the points in time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> respectively. Namely, the operations may be started from the point in time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and the operations from the point in time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the point in time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are repeated. Also in this case, sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> between the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines and sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, and Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines are alternately generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows still other waveforms during the sustaining period Ts in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. By applying the anode potential Vsa to the common electrode Xn in the even-numbered line and the cathode electrode Vsb to the scanning electrode Yn in the even-numbered line at the point in time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, high voltage is applied between the common electrode Xn and the scanning electrode Yn to generate a sustaining discharge <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, by applying the intermediate potential Vsc to the electrodes Xn&minus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the odd-numbered lines, the electrodes Xn and Yn can generate the stable sustaining discharge <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> without receiving a bad influence from the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at the point in time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, by applying the cathode potential Vsb to the common electrode Xn in the even-numbered line and the anode potential Vsa to the scanning electrode Yn in the even-numbered line, high voltage is applied between the common electrode Xn and the scanning electrode Yn to generate a sustaining discharge <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, by applying the intermediate potential Vsc to the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines, the electrodes Xn and Yn can generate the stable sustaining discharge <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> without receiving a bad influence from the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Then, by applying the cathode potential Vsb to the common electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Xn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines and applying the anode potential Vsa to the scanning electrodes Yn&minus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines at the point in time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, high voltage is applied between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and between the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 respectively to generate sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, by applying the intermediate potential Vsc to the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines, the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 can generate the stable sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> without receiving a bad influence from the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, by applying the anode potential Vsa to the common electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Xn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines and applying the cathode potential Vsb to the scanning electrodes Yn&minus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines at the point in time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, high voltage is applied between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1 and between the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 respectively to generate sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. On this occasion, by applying the intermediate potential Vsc to the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines, the electrodes Xn&minus;1, Yn&minus;1, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 can generate the stable sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> without receiving a bad influence from the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Hereafter, the operations from the point in time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the point in time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are repeated. In this case, the two sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> are continuously generated between the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines, and thereafter the two sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> are continuously generated between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, and Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines. Incidentally, it is suitable that after all sustaining discharges required between the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines are performed, all sustaining discharges required between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, and Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines are performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a sectional view of an ALIS mode plasma display. This structure is basically the same as that of the progressive mode plasma display in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In the ALIS mode, however, all the intervals between the electrodes Xn&minus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Yn&minus;1, Xn, Yn, Xn&plus;1, and Yn&plus;1 are the same, and the light-interceptive members <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> do not exist. Gaps between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, between the electrodes Xn and Yn, and between the electrodes Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 are respectively defined as first slits, and gaps between the electrodes Yn&minus;1 and Xn and between the electrodes Yn and Xn&plus;1 are defined as second slits. In the ALIS mode, sustaining discharges in the first slits are performed in the first frame FR in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, and sustaining discharges in the second slits are performed in the second frame FR subsequent to the first frame FR. In the ALIS mode, the number of display lines (rows) is double the number thereof in the progressive mode, and hence high definition can be realized. Concerning a more detailed art of the ALIS mode, an art disclosed in EP0762373 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 09-160525, U.S. Ser. No./690038) is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Namely, during the first half addressing period Ta<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a pulse having the positive potential Va is applied to the addressing electrode Aj, and pulses <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, and so on having the cathode potential Vsb are applied to the scanning electrodes Yn&minus;1, Yn&plus;1, and so on in the odd-numbered lines sequentially by scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> During the second half addressing period Ta<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a pulse having the positive potential Va is applied to the addressing electrode Aj, and pulses <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> and so on having the cathode potential Vsb are applied to the scanning electrodes Yn and so on in the even-numbered lines sequentially by scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, operations during the sustaining period Ts are performed. The sustaining period Ts is the same as that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Also in this case, sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> between the electrodes Xn and Yn in the even-numbered lines and sustaining discharges <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>831</bold></highlight> between the electrodes Xn&minus;1 and Yn&minus;1, and Xn&plus;1 and Yn&plus;1 in the odd-numbered lines can be generated alternately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned processing is processing in the first frame. In the first frame, sustaining discharges in the first slits are performed. Processing in the second frame is processing subsequent to the first frame, in which sustaining discharges in the second slits are performed. In the processing in the second frame, it is recommended that waveforms of the common electrodes Xn and so on in the even-numbered lines and the common electrodes Xn&minus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Xn&plus;1, and so on in the odd-numbered lines during the sustaining period Ts in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> be exchanged. Namely, exchange of processing by the first common electrode sustaining circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and processing by the second common electrode sustaining circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is recommended. Incidentally, instead of the waveforms of the common electrodes, waveforms of the scanning electrodes may be exchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the ALIS mode, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the distances of the first slit and the second slit are the same, and hence malfunctions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> are prone to occur. According to this embodiment, even in the ALIS mode, each of the display cells can generate a stable sustaining discharge without being adversely affected by the display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the configuration of a common electrode sustaining circuit <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> and a scanning electrode sustaining circuit <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>. The common electrode sustaining circuit <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> corresponds to the common electrode sustaining circuits <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and it is connected to a common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight>.

A capacitor <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> is composed of the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight>, the scanning electrode <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight>, and an insulator between them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The common electrode sustaining circuit <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> has a TERES (Technology of Reciprocal Sustainer) circuit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> and a power recovery circuit <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> First, the configuration of the TERES circuit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> will be explained. An anode of a diode <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> is connected to a first potential (for example, Vs/2 &lsqb;V&rsqb;) via a switch <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, and a cathode thereof is connected to a second potential (for example, ground) lower than the first potential via a switch <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight>. One end of a capacitor <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> is connected to the cathode of the diode <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, and the other end thereof is connected to the second potential via a switch <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>. An anode of a diode <highlight><bold>936</bold></highlight> is connected to the cathode of the diode <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> via a switch <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight>, and a cathode thereof is connected to the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight>. An anode of a diode <highlight><bold>937</bold></highlight> is connected to the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight>, and a cathode thereof is connected to the aforementioned other end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> via a switch <highlight><bold>938</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the TERES circuit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> without the power recovery circuit <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> will be explained. An explanation is given with the common electrode Xn in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as an example. At the point in time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> are closed, and the switches <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>938</bold></highlight> are opened. Then, the potential of Vs/2 is applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> via the switches <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight>. The anode potential Vsa is, for example, Vs/2 &lsqb;V&rsqb;. Moreover, as for the capacitor <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, an electrode on the upper side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (hereinafter referred to as an upper end) is connected to Vs/2, and an electrode on the lower side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (hereinafter referred to as a lower end) is connected to the ground, and this capacitor is charged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Then, at the point in time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>938</bold></highlight> are closed, and the switches <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> are opened. Then, the ground potential is applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> via the switches <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>938</bold></highlight>. The intermediate potential Vsc is, for example, the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at the point in time t<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>938</bold></highlight> are closed, and the switches <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> are opened. Then, the upper end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> has the ground and the lower end thereof has &minus;Vs/2. The cathode potential of &minus;Vs/2 is applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> via the switch <highlight><bold>938</bold></highlight>. The cathode potential Vsb is, for example, &minus;Vs/2 &lsqb;V&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at the point in time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> are closed, and the switches <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>938</bold></highlight> are opened. Then, the ground potential is applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> via the switches <highlight><bold>923</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight>. Hereafter, the operations from the point in time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the point in time t<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned use of the TERES circuit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> makes it possible to generate the anode potential Vsc, the cathode potential Vsb, and the intermediate potential Vsc by a simple circuit configuration without a special circuit for generating the intermediate potential Vsc being required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Next, the configuration of the power recovery circuit <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> will be explained. A lower end of a capacitor <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> is connected to the lower end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>. An anode of a diode <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> is connected to an upper end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> via a switch <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight>, and a cathode thereof is connected to the anode of the diode <highlight><bold>936</bold></highlight> via a coil <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight>. An anode of a diode <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> is connected to the cathode of the diode <highlight><bold>937</bold></highlight> via a coil <highlight><bold>939</bold></highlight>, and a cathode thereof is connected to the upper end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> via a switch <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the power recovery circuit <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> will be explained referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. First, to generate a potential <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> are closed, and the other switches are opened. Then, the potential of Vs/2 is applied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> via the switches <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight>. The anode potential Vsa is, for example, Vs/2 &lsqb;V&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, to generate a potential <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>941</bold></highlight> are closed, and the other switches are opened. Then, a charge at the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> is supplied to the upper end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> via the coil <highlight><bold>939</bold></highlight>. The lower end of the capacitor <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> is connected to the second potential (GND) via the switch <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>. By LC resonance of the coil <highlight><bold>939</bold></highlight> and the capacitor <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight>, the capacitor <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> is charged, and electric power is recovered, whereby the potential drops to the potential <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. Moreover, by the diodes <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>937</bold></highlight>, resonance is eliminated at the potential <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, and the potential <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> can be stabilized by the coil <highlight><bold>939</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, to generate a potential <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>938</bold></highlight> are closed, and the other switches are opened. Then, the potential <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> of the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> changes to the ground. A potential <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> is the same as the potential <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, to generate a potential <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight> are closed, and the other switches are opened. An electric charge charged in the capacitor <highlight><bold>931</bold></highlight> is supplied to the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> via the coil <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight> and the diodes <highlight><bold>933</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>936</bold></highlight>. As a result, the potential rises to the potential <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and becomes stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, to generate the potential <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>, the switches <highlight><bold>921</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>935</bold></highlight> are closed, and the other switches are opened. Then, the potential <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> of the common electrode <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> rises to Vs/2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> By repeating the aforementioned operations periodically, a waveform during the sustaining period Ts can be produced. The configuration of the scanning electrode sustaining circuit <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> is the same as that of the common electrode sustaining circuit <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>. The use of the power recovery circuit <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> enables a rise in energy efficiency and a reduction in power consumption. Owing to the property of the power recovery circuit <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>, the potential <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is slightly higher than the ground, and the potential <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is slightly lower than the ground, but the potential <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and the potential <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> need not be the same, and both the potentials need only to be lower than the anode potential Vsa and higher than the cathode potential Vsb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As stated above, according to this embodiment, by applying the anode potential Vsa to one of the common electrode (Xn) and the scanning electrode (Yn) and the cathode potential Vsb to the other thereof, a sustaining discharge can be generated between the common electrode (Xn) and the scanning electrode (Yn) On this occasion, by applying the potential Vsc, which is lower than the anode potential Vsa and higher than the cathode potential Vsb, to the common electrodes (Xn&minus;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Xn&plus;1) and the scanning electrodes (Yn&minus;1, Yn&plus;1) adjacent to the common electrode (Xn) and the scanning electrode (Yn) between which the sustaining discharge is generated, a display cell in which the sustaining discharge is generated can prevent a bad influence from display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that any of the above-described embodiments is just a concrete example for carrying out the present invention, and therefore the technical range of the present invention is not intended to be interpreted in a narrow sense by them. In other words, the present invention can be realized in various forms without departing from its technical idea or its primary characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As explained above, by applying an anode potential to one of a first and a second display electrode and a cathode electrode to the other thereof, a sustaining discharge can be generated between the first and the second display electrode. On this occasion, by applying a potential, which is lower than the anode potential and higher than the cathode potential, to a first and a second electrode adjacent to the first and the second electrode between which the sustaining discharge is generated, a display cell in which the sustaining discharge is generated can prevent a bad influence from display cells adjacent thereto. </paragraph>
