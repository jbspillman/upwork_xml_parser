<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to surface maintenance or conditioning machines, and particularly those machines employing one or more surface maintenance or conditioning appliances or tools that perform one or more tasks including, among others, scrubbing, sweeping, and polishing or burnishing. More specifically, the present invention is particularly directed to a variable down-force coupling system for such surface conditioning machines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Surface maintenance vehicles that perform a single surface maintenance or surface conditioning task are, of course, well known. Surface maintenance vehicles are generally directed to perform work in diverse maintenance, conditioning and cleaning applications such as for flooring surfaces. In this disclosure, the term floor refers to any support surface, such as, among others, floors, pavements, road surfaces, ship decks, and other surfaces to be cleaned and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Commonly floor or surface maintenance machines are constructed having a single surface conditioning appliance or system so as to only sweep, others to scrub, while still others only to polish or burnish. It is of course possible to construct a single surface maintenance machine to perform one or more of the aforementioned surface maintenance tasks. One example of a multi-task floor conditioning machine is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,204,280, entitled &ldquo;Floor Cleaning &amp; Waxing Machine,&rdquo; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for any and all purposes. Another is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,483,718, entitled, &ldquo;Floor Scrubbing Machine Having Impact Energy Absorbtion,&rdquo; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated be reference herein in its entirety for any and all purposes. Disclosed therein is a forward mounted scrubber assembly that is followed by a squeegee assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Scrubbing systems are well known in the art. Scrubbing systems commonly include a driver assembly and a rotatable scrubber in the form of a brush, pad, or the like. A control device may be utilized for controlling the degree of scrubbing (typically a function of down-force applied through the scrubber) applied to a floor surface depending upon the type and/or condition of floor surface intended to be scrubbed. The scrubber driver assemblies for scrubbing systems are well known in the art and commonly include one or more rotatable brushes driven by a driver motor affixed to a scrubber head. Scrubber heads of the prior art have been selectively raised and lowered by an actuator coupled to the driver so as to achieve an intended down force or scrubbing pressure of the srub pad against a floor surface. Examples of the latter are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,757,566, 4,769,271, 5,481,776, 5,615,437, 5,943,724, and 6,163,915, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for any and all purposes. Common to some of the control systems of the aforementioned prior art is the employment of a current sensor that monitors the current drawn by the driver motor. In some of the aforementioned systems of the prior art a &ldquo;pressure sensor&rdquo; is employed that is representative of the pressure of the scrubber head against the floor. Still others attempt to control torque load on the motor indicated by the sensed motor current. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an efficient structure for controlling the down force of a working head in engagement with a surface to be cleaned, maintained, or otherwise conditioned. The invention further relates to a method of engaging and using such a control structure to perform surface cleaning, surface maintenance, surface conditioning and the like. While the present invention is described and depicted primarily with reference to a cleaning head having dual rotary scrubbing brushes, the present invention finds diverse application in the art of surface cleaning, maintenance, conditioning and the like. Accordingly, the present invention is readily adaptable to cleaning heads having one or more of the following applications, including without limitation, such cleaning heads designated and adapted to: burnish, polish, scrub, sweep, brush, treat and wipe a surface to be cleaned wherein an ability to control the downforce of the head is beneficial. Of course, such cleaning head implements or cleaning head appliances may each be provided with an embodiment of the present invention and coupled to a single dedicated surface maintenance vehicle or to more than one such cleaning head coupled to a single vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention is particularly applicable to a floor scrubbing machine having a scrub head mounted in front of the machine chassis. The scrub head includes a scrub brush or pad and a scrub driver. A linear actuator is utilized to raise and lower the scrub head relative to the floor surface. The scrub head has a predetermined weight which may be supported by the scrub brush in a first operational mode of use. In the first operational mode of use, the scrub head is floatingly supported by the machine so that the scrub head can follow the contours or undulations of the floor surface. In this mode of operation vertical movement of the scrub head relative to the machine is relatively unconstrained. In a second operational mode of use the floor scrubbing machine additionally engages the linear actuator for use in a second operational mode of use. In the second mode of use, the linear actuator may be engaged to transfer additional force to the scrub head, increasing the down force supported by the scrub pad, and increasing the relative scrubbing work performed by the machine. In the second mode of operation, movement of the scrub head relative to the machine is relatively constrained by the linear actuator </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention is the provision of a mechanical system for transferring between the first and second operational modes of use. An operator manipulable element may be utilized to change from the first operational mode of use to the second operational mode of use. An automatic disengagement for returning the machine to the first operational mode of use is also provided by one aspect of the present invention. In one embodiment, the automatic disengagement is in response to the scrub head being raised away from the floor surface toward its transport position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides several advantages over both prior art and contemporary apparatus for controlling the down force, and hence scrub pressure of a cleaning head coupled to a cleaning machine. The present invention may be implemented without a sophisticated electronic control. As a result the present invention is generally lower cost, easier to maintain and less prone to breakage than prior art (and complex contemporary) cleaning head control mechanisms and algorithms.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A floor scrubbing machine which uses the present invention is shown in normal operating position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The scrubbing machine has two front wheels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and two rear caster wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a transaxle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> providing traction drive to the front wheels. The transaxle and rear casters are attached to a frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which supports a housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This housing encloses rechargeable batteries which supply energy to power the machine. It also contains a recovery tank to hold soiled scrub water recovered by a vacuum squeegee <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from a floor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> being scrubbed. A hinged lid <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> contains a tank for clean scrubbing solution to be dispensed to the floor and a vacuum fan to lift soiled scrub water from the floor via the squeegee <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and deposit it in the recovery tank. A control console <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides necessary controls for an operator who walks behind the scrubber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in position to scrub the floor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> encloses two scrub brushes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The brushes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are driven by two electric motors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> but omitted for clarity in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. An electric actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> attached between the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> raises the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for transport, lowers it for work, and controls its down pressure on the floor. Additional aspects of the electric actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and associated mechanical coupling are described in more detail hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> uses two disk scrub brushes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> rotating about parallel vertical axes. Alternatively, scrub heads may be made with only one disk scrub brush, or one or more cylindrical brushes rotating about horizontal axes. All of these variations can be applied to this invention. The illustrated scrubber is a relatively small model, controlled by an operator walking behind it. Scrubbers are made in much larger sizes, some of which have the operator riding on them. Again, the invention can be applied to larger machines if the essential elements of the invention are observed. While a scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, any appliance or tool for providing surface maintenance, surface conditioning, and/or surface cleaning to a surface may be coupled to an associated machine or vehicle in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a portion of the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and associated coupling structure. The scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a coupling structure which allows it to be raised and lowered and allows the brushes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to conform to undulations in the floor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by lower control arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, guide linkage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and electric linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and associated coupling structure, including an upper mount assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for securing one end of the linear actuator to the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a lower bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for selectively securing the other end of the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Additional aspects of the lower bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are provided hereinafter. The two lower control arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the scrub head housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with pivoted connections at their ends. Two upright arms <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be connected to bracket <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, to make an assembly <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This part <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached to the scrub head housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Guide <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is attached to the front wall of the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Guide <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides a slot <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> within which roller <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can move up and down. This slot <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has an arcuate lower portion which is generally vertical and an upper portion which slopes up and toward the rear. During normal operation roller <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> rides more or less midway in the lower portion of slot <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, where it moves through the same arc as the front pivots of arms <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to keep the brushes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> parallel to the floor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> rises and falls while passing over any undulations in the floor. Two springs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are attached between the scrub head housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the arms <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Since the arms <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are constrained at their upper ends by slot <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and at their lower ends by pivot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the action of springs <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is to tend to tilt the forward part of the scrub head upward around pivot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Scrub head <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is caused to tilt when it is raised to ease access to the components thereof by an operator of vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Additional aspects of the scrub head are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,483,718, incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a perspective view of an embodiment of cleaning head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the present invention shown in an unassembled, exploded view adjacent frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of surface maintenance vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and wherein coupling between such parts is shown in ghost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is used to raise the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for transport, lower it for work in a first operational mode, and controls its down pressure on the floor in a second operational mode. Linear actuator assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> preferably is an electric actuator having a leadscrew member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. As in known in the art, leadscrew member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a thread set formed thereupon and has a distal end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which is movable in response to leadscrew <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> rotation. Additional linear actuators may include hydraulic or hybrid electro-hydraulic devices (not shown). The distal end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of leadscrew member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has a pin-receiving aperture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> formed therein. A pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> coupled to the aperture <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may engage dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as described herein. As described in more detail herein, pin member <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> also is coupled to a manual transition device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which preferably comprises a strap member having a handle for ease of manipulation by an operator of vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The precise sequence of moving pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in elongate pathway of dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is later described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A biasing spring member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is preferably provided that engages the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The biasing spring member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> provides a force that assists in the placement of pin member <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the pathway of dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Biasing spring member <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> assists in the movement of pin member <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (and thus the distal end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the leadscrew member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) when the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is raised (thus returning the scrub head to a default operational state). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates additional aspects of the upper mount assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which couples the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Upper mount assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a threaded adjustment device <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> which engages a plate member <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and a channel member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Channel member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is coupled to the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the plate member <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> through associated pins <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The threaded adjustment device <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, in the illustrated embodiments being a threaded fastener, may be manipulated during manufacturing or subsequent servicing to adjust the relative position of the linear actuator to the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. An adjustment may be required to select a predetermined amount of down force exerted by the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Upper mount assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is thus adjustable to compensate for manufacturing variances of the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Adjustments may be made to the relative position of the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via threaded adjustment device <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> as required during a servicing procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is attached to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by a pair of threaded fasteners <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> disposed through a pair of additional &ldquo;travel&rdquo; springs <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> defines a range of positions for the constrained pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (and thus linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) relative to the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a configured aperture having a channel portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, an intermediate detent portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and a shoulder portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, discrete pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> locations may be defined in dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, including, a &ldquo;floating&rdquo; position <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> within the channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, a middle or &ldquo;transition&rdquo; position <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> proximate to the detent portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and a &ldquo;high force&rdquo; position <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> proximate to the shoulder portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. When the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is within the channel portion <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> (position <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>), the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is relatively unconstrained by the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and can move vertically (to displace pin within channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>) to follow minor undulations in the floor surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is not under axial load from the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, i.e., the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> does not transfer an axial force to increase the down force of the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Minor movement of the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> causes the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to deviate (generally vertically) from within channel <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> as depicted by arrows <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The machine operating with the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in position <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be characterized as being in a first mode of operation. In the first mode of operation, the scrub brush <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> pressure is a function of the scrub head mass and no additional machine weight is transferred to the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For general scrubbing operations, the first mode of operation provides generally sufficient performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A second operational mode is defined by the present invention. The machine may be characterized as being in a second, &ldquo;heavy scrub&rdquo; mode of operation when the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is proximate the shoulder portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. When the pin is in position <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is constrained by the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in direct axial engagement with the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and is able to transfer a force through bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and travel springs <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to increase the downward force of the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> transfers a portion of the machine weight to the scrub head unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to increase the scrubbing down force and increase the scrubbing action to the floor surface. In the second operational mode, the travel springs <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> are slightly compressed and transfer the additional down force to the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, while providing a range of vertical movement to the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to permit the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to follow the ground surface as in the first mode of operation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the machine as being in a second mode of operation. In the second mode of operation, the scrub brush <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> pressure is controlled by the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A controller (not shown) may be utilized to provide a variable down force (via variable displacement of the actuator) to the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in the second mode of operation. For aggressive or heavy scrubbing operations, the second mode of operation provides increased scrubbing performance. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the level of downforce in the first &ldquo;floating mode&rdquo; of operation is roughly half the magnitude of the &ldquo;high force&rdquo; mode of operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The movement of the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> relative to the bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is controlled, at least in part by an operator manipulable handle <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Handle <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may be accessed via an aperture in the housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Handle <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may be grasped by an operator and pulled away from the machine to transition the machine between its first mode of operation into its second mode of operation. An intermediate position <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> within the dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided whereby the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is engaged by a detent portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. With the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> engaged by the detent portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be lowered into engagement with the floor surface with the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> travelling into position <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> adjacent the shoulder portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Upon raising the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from the work surface after a heavy scrubbing operation, the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is biased by the spring <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to return the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> from position <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to a position proximate to its rear face <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, thus returning the machine to its normal operation configuration. As such, an automatic transition occurs between the second &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; scrub mode of operation and the first &ldquo;normal&rdquo; mode of operation as the scrub head is raised from the floor surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A method of transitioning a scrubber from a first &ldquo;normal&rdquo; operating mode to a second &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; operating mode comprises the following steps: accessing a scrubber in a first &ldquo;normal scrub&rdquo; mode of operation; raising the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> away from the floor surface; actuating a strap member <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> so that a pin member <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> coupling cleaning head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to the vehicle is displaced into engagement with a detent portion <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>; and engaging the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to lower the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> toward the floor surface so that the pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is moved into contact with shoulder portion <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>; and further engaging the linear actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to transfer additional downforce to the scrub head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Additional considerations and alternative embodiments with respect to the present invention may include substituting or eliminating certain components and/or subcomponents of the illustrated embodiment. For example, a first and second magnitude of downforce may be provided that different by a simple integer value of magnitude (i.e., one is double or triple the other) or any fractional difference of downforce. As also noted above, manual actuator or strap member <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may be disposed adjacent leadscrew member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as depicted herein or may be remotely mechanically coupled, or may be electronically actuated locally or remotely by an operator of vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or strap member <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is remotely activated additional mechanical (or electronic) means of actuating pin member <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> travel between positions <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be required. With respect to intermediate position <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, alternative embodiments may dispense with intermediate position <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> entirely and provide for a direct transition from floating position <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> high force position <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. While bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a path for pin member <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to navigate between a floating position <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and high force position <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a rotary cam which creates displacement, for example with an offset eccentric portion or offset pin location(s) may be used to perform substantially the same function as dual stage bracket <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. The invention in its broader aspects is, therefore, not limited to the specific details, representative apparatus and illustrative examples shown and described. Accordingly, departures from such details may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the applicant&apos;s general inventive concept. </paragraph>
