<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a communication control method and apparatus that is connected to both a network managed by the HTTP protocol and an internet facsimile apparatus, and controls communication between both sides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the recent years, computer networks have been built to effectively share information using groupware software, in organizations such as corporations. Such networks (groupware networks) often incorporate internet technologies and employ groupware software available from WWW browsers. Thus, client terminals such as PC units on such a groupware network can share information on the groupware network by using the WWW browsers. The client terminals can therefore utilize functions such as e-mail and electronic bulletin boards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, facsimile apparatuses have been recently developed, which can transmit image information via internet, with operations similar to ordinary facsimile machines. These kinds of facsimile machines are called internet facsimile apparatuses (IFAX units), since they utilize internet for their entire/partial communication paths. Such an IFAX converts facsimile data into an e-mail format to transmit the data, when transmitting image information. When receiving image information, on the other hand, an IFAX converts the received e-mail data into a facsimile format, and performs a printing process. Such an IFAX controls e-mail data communication in accordance with protocol such as the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and the POP3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, on the above-described groupware networks that use WWW browsers, all data is communicated in accordance with the HTTP protocol. Therefore, an IFAX that controls communication according to the SMTP and the POP3 cannot function on such a network. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This invention is provided in view of the above-described problems. The object of the present invention is to provide a communication control apparatus and method, with which IFAX units can normally function on networks managed by the HTTP protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With the present invention, e-mail can be received according to the SMTP protocol between IFAX units, the e-mail data is converted into HTML data, the destination address of the e-mail data is converted into a URL format, and the HTML data is transmitted to the converted URL on the network by using the HTTP protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, between the IFAX units, various signals and e-mail data are communicated according to the SMTP. On the network, however, various signals and e-mail data are communicated according to the HTTP protocol. Therefore, even on a network managed by the HTTP protocol, the IFAX units can normally transmit e-mail.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the present invention is explained in the following, in reference to the above-described drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a conceptual rendering illustrating a network on which a communication control apparatus operates according to an embodiment of the present invention. A communication control apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the embodiment of the present invention is connected to an IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and functions as an adaptor to convert the communication protocol, when transmitting e-mail between the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a connected network. Therefore, in the embodiment of the present invention, the communication control apparatus is called an adaptor (ADPT) in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> connected to the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are also connected to a network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, which is a LAN (Local Area Network) or the like, along with a communication terminal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which is a PC or the like. The network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is managed by a server that uses groupware software (groupware server). In this embodiment, the network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> managed by the groupware server is called a groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> This groupware server manages a network using the HTTP protocol, for example. Also, the groupware server functions as a WEB server, and by utilizing client terminals such as a PC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> connected to the groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, or a WWW browser as an outer client terminal, the groupware server can provide information-sharing environment on the groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> On the groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, when e-mail is communicated between the PC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> units, the e-mail is transmitted in accordance with the HTTP protocol. When e-mail is communicated between the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> units, e-mail needs to be transmitted in accordance with the HTTP protocol, as it is transmitted from the PC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this case of e-mail communication, the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> units make adjustments between the HTTP protocol used to manage the network to which the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> units are connected, and the SMTP protocol normally used to operate the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Specifically, an ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>A connected to an IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A of the sending side (ADPT of the sending side) receives e-mail data that is processed according to the SMTP protocol at the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A of the sending side, and transmits the e-mail data to an ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B connected to an IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B of the receiving side (ADPT of the receiving side) according to the HTTP protocol that is used on the groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>B of the receiving side receives the e-mail data processed according to the HTTP protocol and forwards the e-mail data to the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B of the receiving side, according to the SMTP protocol that is used by the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B of the receiving side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thus, e-mail communication is performed between the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> units that are connected to the groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, similar to processing normal e-mail communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a conceptual rendering illustrating communication protocol used for performing e-mail communication on a network shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As described above, on the groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, e-mail data communication with the PC <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or with the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is performed according to the HTTP protocol. Also, the e-mail data communication between the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is performed according to the SMTP protocol (POP3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a hardware structure of the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that functions as described above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A signal type moderator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> determines types of command signals that are output from the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via the second LAN I/F <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and notifies an SMTP/POP3 processor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, HTTP processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and e-mail communicator <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> of receipt of command signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The SMTP/POP3 processor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> performs communication of various command signals and data with the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via the second LAN I/F <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the SMTP protocol or POP3 protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The HTTP processor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> performs communication of various command signals and data with the groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> via the first LAN I/F <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the HTTP protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The e-mail communicator <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> performs e-mail data communication with the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via the second LAN I/F <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. When the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the IFAX of the sending side, in other words, when the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> receives e-mail from the IFAX according to the SMTP protocol, the e-mail communicator <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> stores the received e-mail data in the RAM <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is connected to the IFAX of the receiving side, in other words, when the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> forwards the e-mail to the IFAX of the receiving side, the e-mail communicator <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> retrieves e-mail data that is stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and transmits the e-mail data to the IFAX of the receiving side via the second LAN I/F <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, according to the SMTP protocol. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the series of the process for transmitting e-mail from the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A of the sending side to the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B of the receiving side is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> According to the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of the present invention, when transmitting e-mail from the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A of the sending side to the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B of the receiving side, the SMTP protocol is used for the various signal communication and e-mail data communication with the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A. However, the HTTP protocol is used for the various signal communication and e-mail data communication with the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to which the IFAX of the other side is connected. Therefore, even on the groupware network <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> that performs communication according to the HTTP protocol, it is possible for the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to normally perform e-mail communication operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the present invention, e-mail communication between the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>A and the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>B that are connected to one groupware network is illustrated. However, this invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and it is possible to achieve the same effect as in the embodiment, when the invention is applied to e-mail communication between IFAX units that are connected to individual groupware networks <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> via internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention processes e-mail data communication entirely according to the SMTP protocol. Therefore, when the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that is connected to the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> performs e-mail reception operation, according the POP3 protocol, the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> notifies the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that there is no received e-mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The process of the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, when the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that is connected to the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> performs an e-mail reception operation, is illustrated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a sequence chart illustrating a process of the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, when the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that is connected to the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> performs an e-mail reception operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> When the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is to execute an e-mail reception process, the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> also executes the steps to establish a connection with the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is similar to the situation for transmitting e-mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> After the connection is established between the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the SMTP/POP3 processor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> at the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> starts an exchange of command signals with the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, according to the POP3 protocol. Specifically, the SMTP/POP3 processor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> first outputs an OK response that indicates a positive response toward the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving this OK response, the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> outputs a command signal (USER) for mailbox name transmission toward the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving &ldquo;USER&rdquo;, the signal type moderator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> at the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> notifies the SMTP/POP3 processor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of the receipt. Upon receiving the notification, the SMTP/POP3 processor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> outputs an OK response that indicates a positive response toward the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Afterwards, the SMTP/POP3 processor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> receives a command signals: (PASS) for transmission of the mailbox/password output from the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>; and (STAT) for an inquiry of the reception status. In response to each command signal, the SMTP/POP3 processor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> outputs an OK response as a positive response toward the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the &ldquo;STAT&rdquo;, the OK response that is output toward the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes a number of e-mail items and size of the each e-mail data, if there is any received e-mail. The ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> deliberately outputs a message that there is no received e-mail, which is attaching to this OK response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the OK response, the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> transmits a command signal (QUIT) for a notification of the process completion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, upon receiving &ldquo;QUIT&rdquo;, outputs an OK response as a positive response, in response to &ldquo;QUIT&rdquo;. Therefore, the connection established between the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Likewise, according to the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the embodiment of the present invention, when the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> performs e-mail reception operation, according the POP3 protocol, the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> notifies the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that there is no received e-mail. Therefore, it is possible to surely avoid a situation when the ADPT <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> responds to the request of the IFAX <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and fails to function properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and various variations and modifications may be possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> This application is based on the Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-197186 filed on Jun. 28, 2001, entire content of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
