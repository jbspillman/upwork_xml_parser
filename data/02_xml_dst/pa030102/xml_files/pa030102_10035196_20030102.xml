<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In particular, a clutch device <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is included between the bearing housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the rotor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> so as to selectively transmit the rotary power generated by the driving motor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to the basket shaft <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The clutch device <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> includes a solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> fixed to the lower portion of the bearing housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> for generating electromagnetic force, a coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> combined with around the basket shaft <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> for transmitting or intercepting the rotary power while being in an up and down motion due to the electromagnetic force of the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, thus being combined with or being separated from a serration member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> fixed to the rotor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, a spring member <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> installed between the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and the bearing housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the spring member <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> for providing elasticity to the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> so that the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> moves due to the electromagnetic force and then, is returned to an original position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> includes a solenoid coil <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> positioned on the outer circumference of the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> for forming an electric field, and a solenoid case <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> fixed to the bearing housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the solenoid case <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> for supporting the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> includes a serration coupling <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>combined with around the basket shaft <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> by a serration method, the serration coupling <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>combined with or separated from the serration member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a magnetic coupling <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>integrally fixed to around the serration coupling <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the magnetic coupling <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for generating force corresponding to the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> That is, a shaft tooth <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and a rotor tooth <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are respectively formed on the outer circumference of the basket shaft <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and the outer circumference of the serration member <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A coupling tooth <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is formed on the inner circumference of the serration coupling <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The coupling tooth <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> transmits the rotary power of the driving motor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to the basket shaft <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> or intercepts the rotary power of the driving motor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> from the basket shaft <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> while being in the up and down motion along the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, thus combined with or separated from the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The operation of the washing machine with the clutch apparatus according to the conventional technology will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When the laundry is washed or is dried after finishing washing the laundry while integrally rotating the spin basket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, the laundry is washed/dried by driving the driving motor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> in a state where power is not supplied to the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, that is, the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> At this time, the coupling tooth <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> simultaneously gears with and is combined with the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in a state where the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> moves downward due to the elasticity of the spring member <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the spin basket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> integrally rotates together with the pulsator <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> When the laundry is washed while rotating only the pulsator <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> in a state where the spin basket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is stopped, the power is applied to the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>. The electromagnetic force generated by the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> forms a magnetic path for connecting the magnetic coupling <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, the central region of the rotor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, and the basket shaft <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to each other via the bearing housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> positioned in the upper portion of the solenoid case <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and the solenoid case <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. At this time, the magnetic force operates as attraction in the direction, where magnetic reactance is minimized, that is, the direction, where the magnetic coupling <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> approaches to the bottom of the solenoid case <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the coupling tooth <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is separated from the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> and is combined with only the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the rotary power transmitted from the driving motor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is not transmitted to the spin basket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and is transmitted to only the pulsator <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the power supplied to the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> is intercepted in such a state, the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> falls due to the elasticity of the spring member <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and self-weight. Accordingly, the coupling tooth <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> simultaneously gears with the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, in the clutch apparatus of the washing machine according to the conventional technology, since the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> is formed to use direct current (DC) power, an additional DC power supply circuit for supplying the DC must be included. Also, flux leaks since many parts that can be magnetized are arranged around the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>. In particular, since the thickness of the bearing housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the thickness of the solenoid case <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> are about 2 mm, respectively, thus the degree of self-saturation is high, the leakage of the flux deteriorates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also, the magnetic force becomes larger than motive power for raising the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> at an initial stage as the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> rises, thus the distance between the coupling member and the solenoid coil becomes narrower. Accordingly, when the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> rises, excessive magnetic force is generated. Also, when the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> rises and reaches the final position, the magnetic force becomes stronger. Accordingly, the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> collides with the bearing housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, thus causing collision noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the elasticity of the spring member <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> increases so s to rapidly fall the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> against the magnetic force caused by residual flux, a holding voltage applied to the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> must be increased in order to maintain the state where the coupling member <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> rises. Accordingly, consumption of power increases. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a clutch apparatus of a washing machine, which is capable of preventing the generation of collision noise that can be caused when a coupling member rises by letting a clutching operation occurs using repulsive force that pushes the coupling member upward and of reducing the amount of consumption of power for maintaining a state where the coupling member rises by preventing the increase of the compression force of a spring and the increase of a holding voltage according to residual flux after the coupling member rises. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A bearing housing for supporting the basket shaft is installed in the lower portion of the tub and the solenoid case is fixed to the bearing housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The solenoid case is formed of a magnetic member. A plurality of axial slits are formed in the solenoid case. The slits are uniformly formed in the solenoid case to be separated from each other by a predetermined distance in the direction of a circumference. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The operation and the effect of the clutch apparatus according to the present invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> When the laundry is washed while integrally rotating the spin basket <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> or the laundry is to be dried after completing the washing of the laundry, the driving motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is operated in a state where the power is not supplied to the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, that is, a state where the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> At this time, the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> falls while contacting the upper surface of the rotor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the coupling tooth <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is combined with the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a state where the coupling tooth <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>simultaneously gears with the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the rotary power of the rotor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the basket shaft <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> according to the operation of the driving motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the spin basket <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> integrally rotates together with the pulsator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the laundry is washed while rotating the pulsator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in a state where the spin basket <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is stopped, the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is moved upward by applying the power to the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. At this time, the coupling tooth <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is separated from the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is combined with only the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the rotary power generated by the driving motor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is transmitted to only the pulsator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> During the initial operation where the power starts to be applied to the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in order to raise the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the relay switch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> contacts the contact point A so that a higher level of voltage is applied as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When a high level of voltage is applied to the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the eddy current is abandoned to the conductive coupling <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> due to the AC magnetic field formed by the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> between the solenoid case <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the lower bearing housing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. At this time, electromagnetic repulsive force corresponding to Lorenz force operates to the conductive coupling <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is separated from the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and moves upward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> the distribution of the magnetic field and the distribution of the eddy current abandoned to the inside of the conductive coupling <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the position where the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> initially operates. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 98</cross-reference> show the distribution of the magnetic field and the distribution of the eddy current abandoned to the inside of conductive coupling in the position where the coupling member completely rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> rises, the magnitude of the eddy current abandoned to the conductive coupling <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> becomes smaller. The elasticity of the spring member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> arranged in the upper portion of the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> becomes larger, the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> stops in a state where the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> does not collide with the lower bearing housing <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the collision noise is not generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> When the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> rises, to thus reach the position where the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> finally rises, the relay switch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> contacts the contact point B and operates so that a relatively low level of voltage can be applied to the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. At this time, the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is maintained raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a graph comparing the magnetic force according to the displacement of the coupling member of an attractive type clutch apparatus according to a conventional technology with the magnetic force according to the displacement of the coupling member of a repulsive type clutch apparatus according to the present invention. While the electromagnetic force becomes gradually larger as the displacement of the coupling member becomes larger in the conventional attractive type clutch apparatus, the electromagnetic force becomes smaller than the initial electromagnetic force as the displacement of the coupling member becomes larger in the repulsive type clutch apparatus according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> When the power applied to the solenoid coil <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the solenoid actuator <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is intercepted, the coupling member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> rapidly falls due to the elasticity and the self-weight of the spring member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. At this time, the coupling tooth <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is combined with the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a state where the coupling tooth <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>simultaneously gears with the shaft tooth <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the rotor tooth <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, it is possible to integrally drive the spin basket <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Since the clutch apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention is repulsive type where the solenoid actuator pushes the coupling member upward in the lower portion unlike the attractive type clutch apparatus, it is possible to prevent the collision noise that can be generated while the coupling member rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Also, in the clutch apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention, since almost parts that form the coupling member such as the non-magnetic coupling and the conductive coupling are formed of the nonmagnetic material, it is possible to prevent the compressive force and the holding voltage from rising due to the residual flux after the coupling member rises. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the amount of the consumption of the power for maintaining the coupling member raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Also, in the clutch apparatus of the washing machine according to the present invention, the trans for providing the different voltages to the solenoid coil is included. Accordingly, it is possible not to use the conventionally used parts for DC power supply and to reduce the amount of the consumption of the power. </paragraph>
