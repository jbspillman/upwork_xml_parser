<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to methods for aseptically processing rice products, compositions of rice products, and a composition of rice products. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods for aseptically processing rice pudding and aseptic compositions of rice puddings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> During a conventional preparation of rice pudding starch is cooked out of rice grains by heating the rice grains in the presence of an assortment of ingredients such as milk products, egg, flavoring and coloring. This results in softening the rice for consumption, and also in creating a desirable texture and consistency because starch serves to thicken the pudding. Conventional processes require careful stirring of the rice pudding during the heating process to avoid scalding the pudding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 4,585,664, Kohlwey disclosed use of whole grains and broken grains of rice for preparation of a dry instant rice porridge mix. Kohlwey disclosed the rice may be instantized by employing a process similar to that disclosed by Hollis et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 2,828,209. The dry instant porridge mix may be added to milk, brought to a boil with stirring, removed from heat, and eaten after sanding for about five (5) minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is a need for an aseptic process for preparing rice pudding that reduces the potential for scalding the rice pudding. There is also a need for an aseptically produced rice pudding. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention will be shown and described in detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the appended claims. The scope of the present invention will in no way be limited to the number of constituting components, the materials thereof, the shapes thereof, the relative arrangement thereof, etc., and are disclosed simply as an example of the preferred embodiment. The features and advantages of the present invention are illustrated in detail in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout the drawings. Although the drawings are intended to illustrate the present invention, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the food industry, the terms aseptic, sterile and commercially sterile are often used interchangeably. For the rice pudding of the present invention, it is important to know that the rice pudding may be processed aseptically but may not be packaged aseptically so it may not remain aseptic. The term &ldquo;aseptic&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;substantially free from disease, fermentation or putrefaction.&rdquo; Hereinafter &ldquo;aseptic method or aseptic process&rdquo; or &ldquo;process for preparing the rice pudding aseptically&rdquo; or &ldquo;processed aseptically&rdquo; refer to a process or method for substantially freeing food from disease, fermentation or putrefaction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A standard ultra-high-temperature extended-shelf-life (UHT ESL) method for making rice pudding aseptically may include heating the rice pudding from about 270 &deg; F. to about 290 &deg; F. for holding times at least from about 15 to about 30 seconds. Hereinafter &ldquo;ultra-high-temperature extended-shelf-life (UHT ESL)&rdquo; means subjecting the pudding to high temperature and short residence time to aseptically produce rice pudding without making certain quality attributes unacceptable. The UHT ESL aseptic process for preparing the rice pudding of the present invention may satisfy a 1999 United States Public Health Service/Food and Drug Administration Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, Public Health Service/Food and Drug Administration Publication No. 229, 1999) governing preparation of pudding as long as the pudding is not held to be shelf-stable, since the disclosed pudding may not be aseptically packaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A purpose of the present invention is to make the rice pudding aseptic using the high temperature and short time processing without causing the rice pudding to have unacceptable quality attributes. Hereinafter &ldquo;acceptable quality attributes&rdquo; refer to the rice pudding having acceptable texture, flavor, smoothness, color, sweetness, aftertaste, and &ldquo;unacceptable quality attributes&rdquo; refer to the rice pudding having unacceptable texture, flavor, smoothness, color, sweetness, aftertaste. Another important quality attribute may be that the rice becomes sufficiently hydrated by the high temperature and short time processing of the rice in the rice pudding that the rice may not be too hard to chew, yet not so soft after being subjected to high temperature and short time processing that the rice has lost piece integrity. Hereinafter, retaining &ldquo;piece integrity&rdquo; means after being subjected to high temperature and short time processing that the rice may not be too hard to chew, or alternatively, be too soft so that it can be deformed by a human mouth without chewing. Food companies may utilize professional taste testers who have tasted acceptable and unacceptable rice pudding, wherein the taste testers may be able to distinguish whether the rice pudding has acceptable or unacceptable quality attributes. The rice in the rice pudding having acceptable quality piece integrity may lose this acceptable quality attribute if the rice becomes dry or brittle as the pudding ages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a method <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for aseptically preparing a rice pudding, comprising the following steps: step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, forming a mixture that includes a rice, wherein the rice includes a pre-broken rice; step <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, hydrating the rice; and step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, aseptically processing the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the rice of the step <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the method <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise a mixture of a whole grain and a pre-broken rice. In an embodiment, the rice may comprise from about 60 to about 80 percent by weight the broken rice and from about 20 to about 40 percent by weight the whole grain rice. Alternatively the rice may be a commercially available instant rice IM 75 comprising 75 percent by weight broken rice and 25 percent by weight whole grain rice. </paragraph>
