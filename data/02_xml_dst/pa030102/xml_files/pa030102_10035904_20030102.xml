<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device and a method for monitoring a pressure sensor, which is positioned in a braking system of a vehicle. Such devices and methods are known in a variety of modifications from the related art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, the following procedure for monitoring a pressure sensor is described in the article &ldquo;FDR&mdash;Die Fahrdynamikregelung von Bosch&rdquo; &lsqb;ESP&mdash;electronic stability program of Bosch&rsqb; published in the automotive engineering journal ATZ Automobiltechnische Zeitschrift, vol. 96, issue no. 11 (1994) pp. 674 through 689: In order to monitor a pressure sensor, here we are concerned with an admission pressure sensor, a so-called active pressure sensor test is carried out. In this active pressure sensor test, braking pressure is fed into the braking system, using a pump included in the braking system, preferably using a precharge pump. At the same time it is checked whether the pressure sensor signal is acting plausibly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This kind of monitoring has the disadvantage that an active pressure buildup is required to carry out the pressure sensor test, and this is realized with the aid of a precharge pump. As a result, this pressure sensor test cannot be used for braking systems which do not have a precharge pump at their disposal. This kind of pressure sensor test also has the disadvantage that, during malfunctioning of the precharge pump, monitoring the pressure sensor is no longer possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Consequently, one of the objects of the present invention is to create a device and a method for monitoring a pressure sensor which, respectively, do not require an active pressure buildup. That is, monitoring a pressure sensor is to be realized, without the use of a precharge pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by the features of claim 1 and claim 13, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> At this point attention is drawn to DE 197 55 112 A1, which, to be sure, does not show a method or monitoring device for carrying out a pressure sensor test, but does show a method and a monitoring device for determining fading of the braking action of a motor vehicle brake. To do this, the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle is measured. The measured longitudinal acceleration is related to an ascertained braking operation. From this is determined whether the measured vehicle longitudinal acceleration corresponds to the braking operation. To determine the braking operation, in particular the braking pressure in a brake fluid line or the excursion of the brake pedal are measured. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The device according to the present invention, for monitoring a pressure sensor positioned in a braking system of a vehicle, includes means whereby a first vehicle movement variable is ascertained during a braking action, which characterizes a vehicle motion in the longitudinal direction. The device, according to the present invention, further includes means with which a mass variable is ascertained that characterizes the mass of the vehicle. Advantageously, for monitoring the pressure sensor, the device according to the present invention includes means with which are ascertained whether the first vehicle motion variable lies within a value range for the first vehicle motion variable, whose limits are ascertained as a function of the mass variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Since the first vehicle motion variable is a function of the vehicle mass, this procedure ensures that, for monitoring the pressure sensor, the first vehicle motion variable is compared to a &ldquo;matching&rdquo; value range, that is, to a value range adapted to the mass of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the first vehicle motion variable is ascertained during a braking action performed by the driver. To do this, only such braking actions are registered in which a regulating device contained in the vehicle does not execute any interventions on the vehicle brakes independently of the driver. Advantageously, the mass variable is ascertained during at least one drive operation. To do this, only such drive operations are registered in which a regulating device contained in the vehicle does not execute any interventions on the propulsion independently of the driver. Because, as the braking actions and/or the drive operations, only those are registered, on which no driver-independent interventions in the vehicle brakes and/or the propulsion are being carried out, one makes sure that monitoring of the pressure sensor in so-called stable operating states of the vehicle is being carried out. By the way, on account of this procedure for monitoring the pressure sensor, no precharge pump is necessary, since, at least within the framework of this monitoring, no driver-independent braking actions are necessary or rather, are taken into account. Thus, the monitoring of the pressure sensor according to the present invention can also be used for braking systems which have no precharge pump, but instead have a pneumatic booster. Additionally, the pressure sensor can also be monitored if a precharge pump malfunctions in a braking system equipped with a precharge pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Using the pressure sensor monitored by the device and the method according to the present invention, an admission pressure variable is ascertained which describes the admission pressure set by the driver. As part of the sensor system, the device according to the present invention is further given means with which wheel speed variables are ascertained, which describe the wheel speeds of the individual wheels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the first vehicle motion variable is ascertained as a function of the admission pressure variable and the wheel speed variables. Advantageously, in the device according to the present invention, means are provided with which a first vehicle deceleration variable is ascertained, at least as a function of the admission presuure variable. This represents the vehicle deceleration to be expected theoretically on account of the operation of the brake by the driver. Ascertainment of the first vehicle deceleration variable is advantageously made by using a mathematical model. As parameters, this contains nominal values, i.e. fixed, predefined variables for the braking torque translation, namely, the wheel radius as well as the vehicle mass. Advantageously, the first vehicle deceleration variable is ascertained in a small timing window. Thus one may assume that interfering influences, such as wind forces, downgrade forces or driving resistance forces have no influence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the device according to the present invention, further means are advantageously provided with which a second vehicle deceleration variable is ascertained, as a function of the wheel speed variables of the rear wheels. This represents the vehicle deceleration which actually occurs during the braking action. In order that the second vehicle deceleration variable should represent the actually occurring vehicle deceleration as accurately as possible, those wheel speed variables of the wheels have to be used for ascertaining it, which are less subject to slipping during a braking action. During a braking action, these are the rear wheels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of ascertaining the first vehicle motion variable, the first and the second vehicle deceleration variable are brought in relation to each other. In this connection, use is made of the fact that, during partial braking, a correlation exists between the admission pressure, which enters into the first vehicle deceleration variable and the vehicle deceleration that occurs, which is represented by the second vehicle deceleration variable. In the case in point, for the ascertainment of the first vehicle motion variable for successive time steps, in each case a relationship is formed between the present first and second vehicle deceleration variable, respectively. The first vehicle motion variable is formed as the average of these relationships. Since there is a connection between the first vehicle motion variable and the sensitivity of the pressure sensor, this first vehicle motion variable can be used to monitor the pressure sensor, in particular, to monitor the sensitivity of the pressure sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the mathematical model for ascertaining the first vehicle deceleration variable includes as a parameter a fixed, predefined value for the vehicle mass. Since, however, depending on the loading of the vehicle, the vehicle mass can differ, this has to be taken into account in monitoring the pressure sensor. Therefore, the limits of the value range, mentioned above, are ascertained as a function of the mass variable. Thereby, tighter error recognition thresholds can be used for monitoring the pressure sensor. The mass variable is advantageously ascertained as a function of a torque variable which describes the drive torque delivered to each drive wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Corresponding to the ascertainment of the first vehicle motion variable, the mass variable is ascertained as a function of a first and a second vehicle acceleration variable. For this purpose, in the device according to the present invention, means are provided with which the first vehicle acceleration variable can be ascertained, at least as a function of the torque variable. This describes the vehicle acceleration to be theoretically expected during the drive procedure. The first vehicle acceleration variable is advantageously ascertained with the aid of a mathematical model, in which the wheel radius as well as the vehicle mass are used as parameters. Corresponding to the first vehicle deceleration variable, the first vehicle acceleration variable is also ascertained in a small time window. This ensures that interfering proportionate shares in the acceleration, which can come about, for example, through wind forces, downgrade forces or driving resistance forces, have no influence on the ascertainment of the first vehicle acceleration variable, because, during this small time window, they may be assumed to be constant, and thus eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the device according to the present invention, means are provided with which the second vehicle acceleration variable is ascertained as a function of the vehicle speeds of the wheels not driven. This describes the vehicle acceleration which actually occurs. Since the second vehicle acceleration variable should describe the actually occurring acceleration as accurately as possible, in correspondence to the procedural manner in the braking action, in the drive procedure as well, those wheels are taken into consideration, which are less subject to slipping. In the drive procedure, these are the wheels not driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the device according to the present invention, means are advantageously provided, with the aid of which, for successive time steps, in each case a relationship is formed of the respectively present first and second vehicle acceleration variable. From these relationships, a second vehicle motion variable is formed as an average value. By forming an average value, the information quality of the second vehicle motion variable is increased, because not only a single point in time, but various points in time, and thus various first and second vehicle acceleration variables enter into the ascertainment of the second vehicle motion variable. The mass variable is ascertained as a function of the second vehicle motion variable. At this point it should be stated that, with reference to the information quality of the first vehicle motion variable, in relation to the first and the second deceleration variable, the same thing applies correspondingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, for the ascertainment of the mass variable, the second vehicle motion variable is compared to the predefined comparison values for the second vehicle motion variable, and the mass variable is ascertained as a function of these comparisons. In this connection, it has proven sufficient, using the mass variable, to distinguish at least between a lightly loaded, a heavily loaded and an overloaded vehicle. In the case of a lightly loaded vehicle, first limits are selected for the value range, and second limits are selected in the case of a heavily loaded vehicle. In this connection, the spread of the first limits is less than the spread of the second limits. The limits ascertained as a function of the mass variable determine the value range of the first vehicle motion variable. Since the first vehicle deceleration variable enters into the ascertainment of the first vehicle motion variable, which is ascertained with the aid of a mathematical model which has nominal values of the vehicle mass and the braking torque transmission, and since the actually present variables of the vehicle mass and the braking torque transmission can be different from the nominal values, the value range has to be adapted to the actually present vehicle states at least as a function of the vehicle mass which, as described above, may be estimated, in order that one can perform meaningful monitoring of the pressure sensor. In this connection, in the case of greater vehicle mass, the value range must be selected larger on account of greater possibilities of fluctuations, so that a more certain monitoring of the pressure sensor can be undertaken. In the case of an overloaded vehicle, no monitoring of the pressure sensor is performed, since in this case, the fluctuation of the vehicle motion variable is too great, and thus, a meaningful monitoring of the pressure sensor is no longer possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Several drive procedures, successive in time, are advantageously evaluated for ascertaining the mass variable. Correspondingly, to determine whether the pressure sensor is defective or not, several braking actions, successive in time, are evaluated. By evaluating several procedures, the quality of each variable or the information is improved. Because, before the value of the mass variable is fixed or before a atatement is made about whether the pressure sensor is faulty or not, the observation results which enter into the measured variable or the information have to be reproducible several times, one after the other. That means, that a faulty value or a faulty information on account of an outlier in the observation results is excluded by this procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> During a starting period of the vehicle engine, which is determined by the driver-dependent starting and stopping of the vehicle engine, advantageously, at least one monitoring of the pressure sensor is carried out. This means that, during the time span defined by turning the ignition key to start the vehicle engine and by pulling the ignition key to stop the engine, at least one monitoring of the pressure sensor is carried out. In the following discussion, this starting period is denoted as an ignition cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the status of the pressure sensor present during the preceding starting period is taken into account in monitoring the pressure sensor during the current starting period or the current ignition cycle. The process of the monitoring of the pressure sensor during the current starting period is determined as a function of this status. Thus, in the case that, during the preceding starting period, no malfunction of the pressure sensor was determined, monitoring the pressure sensor is carried out with the aid of the value range, whose limits are ascertained as a function of the mass variable. On the other hand, in the case that, during the preceding starting period, a malfunction of the pressure sensor was determined, a modified monitoring of the pressure sensor is carried out with the aid of a value range whose limits are predefined in a fixed manner. In this connection, the spread of these limits predefined in a fixed manner is greater than the spread of the limits ascertained as a function of the mass variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, at least one monitoring of the pressure sensor is carried out during one starting period. In this connection, an attempt is made to begin the monitoring of the pressure sensor as rapidly as possibly after starting the vehicle engine, and to terminate it as soon as possible, i.e. to be able to make a statement as soon as possible as to whether the pressure sensor is faulty or not. However, in the framework of monitoring the pressure sensor, as was mentioned above, since several braking actions and several drive procedures are being evaluated, it is obvious that the time span required for monitoring the pressure sensor has different values, depending on the manner of drive of the driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the aforesaid comments, the concept of the preceding starting period is used, which says implicitly that, starting from the current starting period, clearly, the directly preceding starting period is to be taken into accounted. In this connection, it should be mentioned here that one of the previous starting periods can also be taken into account, or several of the previous starting periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> If no fault of the pressure sensor is determined in the modified monitoring of the pressure sensor, advantageously, subsequently to the modified monitoring of the pressure sensor, a monitoring of the pressure sensor is carried out with the aid of the value range, whose limits are ascertained as a function of the mass variable. This means that the regular, i.e. customary monitoring of the pressure sensor follows the modified monitoring of the pressure sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It has proven of particular advantage, to terminate monitoring of the pressure sensor in the case where a fault of the pressure sensor is determined in response to the modified monitoring. Since both during the preceding starting period the pressure sensor was recognized as being faulty, and in response to the modified monitoring of the pressure sensor a fault was again determined, one must assume that the pressure sensor is constantly faulty. That is why renewed monitoring of the pressure sensor is no longer required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, during the performance of the modified monitoring, a regulating device included in the vehicle, for which a pressure variable, ascertained with the aid of the pressure sensor, represents an initial value, is switched to passive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is of particular advantage, for the case in which the monitoring carried out with the aid of the value range whose limits are ascertained as a function of the mass variable, a fault of the pressure sensor is determined, if a regulating device included in the vehicle, for which a pressure variable, ascertained with the aid of the pressure sensor, represents an initial value, is switched off. This manner of proceeding secures that no faulty interventions in the actuator technology takes place. Alternatively, instead of switching off the regulating device, an operation under emergency conditions is provided to set in, in which it has reduced regulating functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> During the monitoring of the pressure sensor, its sensitivity is advantageously checked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Further advantages, as well as advantageous refinements can be inferred from the dependent claims, any combination of the dependent claims also being conceivable, and from the drawings as well as the description of the exemplary embodiments.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Block <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> represents a pressure sensor positioned in the braking system of a vehicle, which is to be monitored with the aid of the device according to the present invention. The variable Pvor, generated with the aid of pressure sensor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, which describes the pressure measured or recorded by pressure sensor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, is supplied to both block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. In the present exemplary embodiment, since we are supposed to be concerned with an admission pressure sensor as pressure sensor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, with which the admission pressure, set by the driver, is to be measured, the variable Pvor is also denoted as an admission pressure variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> a first vehicle deceleration variable axBremsMod is ascertained as a function of admission pressure Pvor. The first vehicle deceleration variable axBremsMod is ascertained with the aid of a mathematical model, for which values predefined in a fixed manner for the braking torque translation, the wheel radius and the vehicle mass are used. Since the first vehicle deceleration variable axBremsMod is ascertained as a function of admission pressure Pvor, this describes the vehicle deceleration theoretically to be expected, based on the operation of the brake by the driver. The first vehicle deceleration variable axBremsMod is supplied to a block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Blocks <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>vl</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>vr</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>hl </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>hr </italic></highlight>represent wheel speed sensors with which wheel speed variables nij are ascertained, which describe the wheel speeds of the individual wheels. Wheel speeds nij are supplied to both block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Corresponding to the notation of the wheel speed variables, the abbreviating notation <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ij </italic></highlight>can also be used for the wheel speed sensors. Here, indeces i and j have the following meaning: Index i indicates whether a front axle (v) or a rear axle (h) is being referred to. Index j indicates whether a right (r) or a left (l) vehicle wheel is being referred to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> a variable axAkt is ascertained as a function of wheel speed variables nij. Depending on which wheel speed variables nij go into the ascertainment of variable axAkt, this variable axAkt is concerned with a second vehicle deceleration variable axAktBrems or with a second vehicle acceleration variable axAktAntrieb. For the sake of clarity, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> only the variable axAkt is represented in connection with block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The above mentioned choice of wheel speed variables takes place as a function of the variable FRadauswahl which is supplied from block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. If vehicle deceleration variable axAktBrems is ascertained in block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, it is supplied to block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. If, on the other hand, second vehicle acceleration variable axAktAntrieb is ascertained in block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, it is supplied to a block <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The concrete realization of block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, as well as the concrete ascertainment of the second vehicle deceleration variable axAktBrems or the second vehicle acceleration variable axAktAntrieb are described further down in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It should be noted here that the representation of the ascertainment of second vehicle deceleration variable axAktBrems or second vehicle acceleration variable axAktAntrieb with the aid of a single block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> should have no limiting effect. It is also conceivable to use two blocks, one block for the second vehicle deceleration variable and one block for the second vehicle acceleration variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> represents further sensor means, which are positioned in the vehicle, in connection with the regulating device contained in the vehicle. If the current subject in this regulating device is, for example, operating dynamics regulation, with which a variable describing the lateral-motion dynamics, especially the yaw rate of the vehicle is to be regulated, block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> includes the following sensor means: a steering angle sensor, a transversal acceleration sensor as well as a yaw rate sensor. In addition, block <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> also includes a braking light switch, which registers the operation of the brake pedal by the driver, and a gas pedal switch, with which the operation of the gas pedal is registered. Further signals S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> generated with the aid of sensor means <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are supplied to block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A first vehicle acceleration variable axAntriebMod is ascertained, with the aid of block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as a function of a torque variable Mkahalb, which is supplied to block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, starting from block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. The torque variable Mkahalb describes the driving torque being supplied to each driven wheel. This torque variable is available from a regulating device, which carries out engine interventions, which is the case, for example, in the case of a yaw rate regulation or an ordinary engine control. The ascertainment of the first vehicle acceleration variable axAntriebMod is made using a mathematical model, for which values, predefined in a fixed manner, for the wheel radius and the vehicle mass are used as parameter. The first vehicle acceleration variable axAntriebMod represents the vehicle acceleration theoretically to be expected. The first vehicle acceleration variable axBremsMod is supplied to block <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Using block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a first vehicle motion variable is ascertained. For this purpose, for each successive time step, a ratio is formed from each of the first vehicle deceleration variable axBremsMod and the second vehicle deceleration variable axAktBrems present, i.e. for successive time steps, in each case the quotient of these two vehicle deceleration variables is formed. These ratios represent, for each time step, a measure of the deviation of the actually occurring vehicle deceleration from the vehicle deceleration theoretically to be expected, on account of the operation of the brake by the driver. In order to be able to make a more accurate statement on this deviation, an average value of these ratios is formed, which represents the first vehicle motion variable. The first vehicle motion variable phiaxBrems is proportional to the sensitivity of the pressure sensor. For this reason, monitoring of the pressure sensor can be performed with the aid of first vehicle motion variable phiaxBrems. In order to do this, first vehicle motion variable phiaxBrems is supplied to a block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Using block <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, a second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb is ascertained. For this purpose, for each successive time step, a ratio is formed from each of the first vehicle acceleration variable axAntriebMod and second vehicle acceleration variable axAktAntrieb present. That is, for successive time steps, in each case a quotient of each present first and second vehicle acceleration variable is formed. These ratios or quotients represent a measure of the vehicle mass, because it is the vehicle acceleration theoretically to be expected, which results from the driving torque supplied to each driven wheel, and the actually occurring vehicle acceleration, which are put into ratio with each other. The second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb is supplied to a block <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> a mass variable MassenKlasse is ascertained as a function of second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb, and it is supplied to block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The specific procedure in ascertaining the mass variable MassenKlasse is discussed below, in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The actual core of the monitoring of pressure sensor <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> takes place in block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, as a function of first vehicle motion variable phiaxBrems and mass variable MassenKlasse. Additional variables FubFrei and FvollSys are supplied to block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> from block ill, for carrying out this monitoring. During the monitoring of the pressure sensor, block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> influences block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> by variable FSysPass. The result of monitoring the pressure sensor is supplied to block ill with the aid of a variable FSysAb. The meaning of the variables mentioned above, and the manner in which the monitoring of the pressure sensor is actually carried out, are discussed within the framework of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> represents the core of the controller of the regulating device contained in the vehicle. Starting from sensor variables Pvor as well as S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supplied to it, controller core <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> ascertains signals or variables S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which are supplied to block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which represents the actuator technology contained in the vehicle. If, in the regulating device contained in the vehicle, we are concerned with an electronic stability program, block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> represents the individual wheel brakes, as well as means for influencing the drive torque given off by the engine. Then, starting from the signals or variables S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, individual wheels are braked to stabilize the vehicle, or rather the engine torque delivered by the engine is reduced. Starting from block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, variables or signals S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are supplied to controller core <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, which give the controller core information regarding the respective status of the actuator technology. The specific procedure can be obtained from the publication mentioned at the beginning, &ldquo;FDR(ESP)&mdash;the Electronic Stability Program of Bosch&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> At this point it should be mentioned that the components essential to the present invention are combined into a block <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The ascertainment of variable axAkt taking place in block <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> The wheel speed variables nij, ascertained with the aid of wheel speed sensors <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ij</italic></highlight>, are supplied to block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Starting from wheel speed variables nij, an unconditioned variable vRoh is ascertained as the vehicle speed in block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The variable axAkt describes the acceleration of the vehicle, and here both the positive and the negative acceleration is meant. In order that variable axAkt might describe as accurately as possible the actually present acceleration of the vehicle, the most suitable wheels, i.e. the wheels less subject to slipping, are selected as a function of the vehicle status in each case. Selection of the wheels and the appertaining wheel speed variables nij takes place with the aid of variable FRadauswahl, which is generated in block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, as was already mentioned in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The procedure is as follows: If a braking action is present, the rear wheels are selected. In that case, variable axAkt represents the second vehicle deceleration variable axAktBrems. On the other hand, if a drive procedure is present, the non-driven wheels are selected. In that case, variable axAkt represents the second vehicle acceleration variable axAktAntrieb. In order to recognize whether a braking action or a drive procedure is present, the signals from the brake light switch and the gas pedal switch are evaluated in Block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. During a braking action, the brake light switch gives off a signal, while the gas pedal switch gives off no signal. During a drive procedure, the gas pedal light switch gives off a signal, while the brake light switch gives off no signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The unconditioned variable vRoh of the vehicle speed is supplied to a block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> represents a filter means, with the use of which a filtered vehicle speed vFil is ascertained from the unconditioned variable vRoh. Filter means <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is, for example, a lowpass. The filtered vehicle speed vFil is supplied to a block <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Block <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> represents a differentiator, with which is formed the differential with respect to time axAktRoh of filtered vehicle speed vFil. Thus, the variable axAktRoh describes the acceleration of the vehicle. Variable axAktRoh is supplied to a block <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, which also represents a filter means. Corresponding to block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, this filter means is also designed as a lowpass. With the aid of filter means <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the variable axAktRoh is transformed into variable axAkt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the two filter means <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are adjusted to each other. Using the two filter means <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a sufficiently smooth and, at the same time, a dynamically acceptable signal pattern is achieved, which, as mentioned above, describes the acceleration of the vehicle. In the first place, influences in the wheel speed variables are eliminated, which stem from so-called rugged road surfaces. The three components <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be designed as analog or digital circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the light of the above comments, made in connection with the selection of wheel speed variables, it should have become clear that variable axAkt, depending on the operating state of the vehicle (drive procedure or braking action), corresponds to either second vehicle acceleration variable axAktAntrieb or to second vehicle deceleration variable axAktBrems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> At this point it should be mentioned that, during a drive procedure, variable axAkt can also alternatively be ascertained from vehicle reference speed vRef. This vehicle reference speed vRef is present in block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and is ascertained, in a known manner, from wheel speed variables nij in consideration of the vehicle motion, which is described, for example, by the transversal acceleration or the yaw rate of the vehicle. The same applies to an all-wheel-driven vehicle. Vehicle reference speed vRef is not identical to unconditioned variable vRoh as the vehicle speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The sequence of the method according to the present invention is described with the aid of the flow diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The method according to the present invention begins with a step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, followed by a step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. In this step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> the variables FsysPass and FsysAb are initialized. With the aid of variable FsysPass, the regulating device contained in the vehicle, and thus also controller core <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are switched to passive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> With the aid of variable FsysAb, the regulating device, and thus the controller core is switched off. Since the regulating device should neither be switched to passive nor switched off at the stage of step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, both variables are initialized by the value FALSE. Subsequent to step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> checks whether the value TRUE has been assigned to variable F&uuml;bFrei. By use of variable F&Uuml;bFrei, starting from block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is notified whether monitoring of the pressure sensor has been released or not. If variable F&Uuml;bFrei has the value TRUE, which means the same as that the monitoring of the pressure sensor has been released, i.e. has the inquiry taking place in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> has been satisfied, subsequently to step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> a step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is executed. On the other hand, if the variable F&uuml;bFrei does not have the value TRUE, which means the same as that the monitoring of the pressure sensor has not been released, then following step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> a step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is carried out, with which the monitoring of the pressure sensor comes to an end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> For the monitoring of the pressure sensor to be released, various additional conditions have to be satisfied: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> No driver-independent braking interventions and/or engine interventions may be carried out. Thus it is ensured that the vehicle is in a stable state. Checking whether driver-independent braking interventions and/or engine interventions are present can be done using internally formed variables in block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> No pumping activity of a pump contained in the braking system may be present. This ensures that the admission pressure set by the driver, which is evaluated by monitoring the pressure sensor, is not invalidated. A corresponding evaluation with respect to pump activity is possible with the aid of internal variables of block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The driver may neither clutch nor shift. That excludes load changes which would have a negative influence on ascertaining the first vehicle deceleration variable or the first vehicle acceleration variable. If the vehicle is equipped with an automatic transmission, clutching or shifting can be recognized by evaluating appropriate flags. If the vehicle is equipped with a standard shift, then the engine speed is monitored with regard to this matter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The steering angle set by the driver must not exceed a predefined value. This ensures that monitoring the pressure sensor does not take place during travel in a curve having a small radius of curvature. For, in such curve travel, additional components may appear in the measured longitudinal acceleration which refer back to the curve travel itself, and which would lead to invalidation of the results in monitoring the pressure sensor. Alternatively to the consideration of the steering angle, the transversal acceleration and/or the yaw rate of the vehicle can also be take into accounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> No implausible wheel signal may be present. If an implausible wheel signal is determined, the corresponding wheel speed sensor remains unconsidered during monitoring of the pressure sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A tire tolerance alignment must have been made. With the aid of the tire tolerance alignment, different wheel radii are detected and corrected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> An adjustment of the pressure sensor to be monitored must have taken place. For this purpose, by forming the average value, the offset in the signal of the pressure sensor is ascertained. This offset is taken into account in the evaluation of the pressure sensor&apos;s signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The vehicle speed must be greater than a predefined value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> it is checked whether a fault of the pressure sensor occurred during the last ignition cycle. If such a fault occurred, subsequently to step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> a step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is executed, by which a modified monitoring of the pressure sensor is introduced. On the other hand, if it is determined in step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> that there was no fault of the pressure sensor in the last ignition cycle, then following step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> a step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is carried out, which introduces the core of the monitoring of the pressure sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the value TRUE is assigned to variable FSysPass, whereby the regulating device contained in the vehicle is switched to passive. Following step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is carried out in which monitoring of the pressure sensor is carried out in a modified fashion. Carrying out the monitoring of the pressure sensor is discussed in detail in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. It should be mentioned at this point that the modified monitoring of the pressure sensor is carried out with the aid of a value range whose limits are predefined in a fixed manner, and whose spread is greater than the spread of the limits ascertained as a function of the mass variable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Subsequent to step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is carried out. In step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, variable FPvorF is evaluated, which is set as a function of the result of monitoring the pressure sensor. In this connection, the following assignment is valid: If it is determined, during monitoring of the pressure sensor, that the latter is faulty, the value TRUE is assigned to variable FPvorF. On the other hand, if it is determined, during monitoring of the pressure sensor, that the latter is not faulty, the value FALSE is assigned to variable FPvorF. Now, during the interrogation taking place in step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, if it is determined that the value FALSE has been assigned to variable FPvorF, a step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is carried out following step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, in which the value FALSE is assigned to variable FSysPass, which means the same thing as canceling the switching to passive of the regulating device. On the other hand, if the interrogation occurring in step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is not satisfied, which means the same as that the pressure sensor is faulty, then subsequently to step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> follows step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. In this step, the value of variable FVollSys is evaluated. Block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is notified with the aid of variable FVollSys from block <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, whether the full system is available, i.e. whether the individual components of the regulating device contained in the vehicle may be reverted to. In this connection, the following value assignment is valid for variable FVollSys: The value TRUE indicates that the full system is available, and the value FALSE indicates that the full system is not available. If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> that the value TRUE has been assigned to variable FVollSys, a step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is carried out subsequently to step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, in which a mass estimation is carried out. The specific procedure for the mass estimation is discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Subsequent to step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> is carried out. If, on the other hand, the interrogation occurring in step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is not satisfied, the mass estimation cannot be carried out, on account of which step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> is carried out at once, following step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With the aid of the interrogation taking place in step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the vehicle is overloaded or not. For this purpose, it is checked whether the value 3 has been assigned to mass variable MassenKlasse. If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> that the vehicle is overloaded, i.e. that the value 3 has been assigned to mass variable MassenKlasse, then monitoring the pressure sensor is not possible. For that reason, subsequent to step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is carried out. On the other hand, if it is determined that the vehicle is not overloaded, monitoring of the pressure sensor can take place, on account of which, subsequently to step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is executed. The actual procedure in carrying out the monitoring of the pressure sensor occurring in step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is discussed in detail in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is followed by a step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, in which the result of monitoring the pressure sensor is evaluated. If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> that the value FALSE has been assigned to the variable FPvorF, which means the same thing as that the pressure sensor is not faulty, a step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is performed following step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, the value FALSE is assigned to variable FSysAb. Following step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is carried out. On the other hand, if the interrogation occurring in step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> is not satisfied, a step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is carried out following step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, in which the value TRUE is assigned to variable FSysAb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Thus, since the pressure sensor is faulty, the regulating device contained in the vehicle is switched off. Step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> follows step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> With the aid of a flow diagram, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the mass estimation taking place in step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The mass estimation begins with a step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, followed by a step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. In this step, the values ZKlasse1, ZKlasse2 and ZKlasse3, which all represent counting units, are initialized. In addition, the mass variable MassenKlasse is initialized. Subsequent to step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is carried out. In step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, the second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb is read in, which is generated, as mentioned before, in block <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> by evaluating several successive time steps of a drive procedure. Subsequent to step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> checks whether the second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb is smaller than a threshold value S. If the second vehicle motion variable is smaller than threshold value S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which means the same thing as that the vehicle is loaded only lightly, then a step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is carried out following step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. In this step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, the counting unit ZKlasse1, which stands for a lightly loaded vehicle, is raised by 1. Subsequent to step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is carried out. On the other hand, if it is determined in step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> that second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb is greater than threshold value S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then a step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is executed following step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. In summary, it can be established that: With the aid of the interrogation taking place in step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the vehicle is only lightly loaded or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> checks whether second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb is less than a threshold value S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, threshold value S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being greater than threshold value S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If the second vehicle motion variable is less than threshold value S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which means the same as that the vehicle is heavily loaded, then a step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is carried out following step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, in which the counting unit ZKlasse2, which stands for a heavily loaded vehicle, is increased by 1. Following step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is carried out. On the other hand, if it is determined in step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> thet the second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb is greater than threshold value S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which means the same as that the vehicle is overloaded, then a step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is carried out following step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, in which the counting unit Zklasse3, which stands for an overloaded vehicle, is increased by 1. Following step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is also carried out. In summary, it can be established that: With the aid of the query occurring in step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> it is determined whether this is a case of a heavily loaded or an overloaded vehicle. The two threshold values S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> define a value range for second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> counting unit ZKlasse1 is compared to a threshold value S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If counting unit ZKlasse1 is greater than, or equal to threshold value S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is carried out, following step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>, in which the value 1 is assigned to mass variable MassenKlasse, since a lightly loaded vehicle was recognized. Following step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> is carried out, with which the mass estimation is terminated. On the other hand, if step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> determines that counting unit Zklasse1 is less than threshold value S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, then a step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is carried out following step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> counting unit Zklasse2 is compared to a threshold value S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. If counting unit Zklasse2 is greater than, or equal to threshold value S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is carried out, following step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, in which the value 2 is assigned to mass variable MassenKlasse, since a heavily loaded vehicle was recognized. Step <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> follows step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if it is determined in step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that counting unit ZKlasse2 is less than threshold value S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, then a step <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> is executed following step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> counting unit ZKlasse3 is compared to a threshold value S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>.

On the other hand, if it is determined in step <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> that counting unit ZKlasse3 is less than threshold value S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, then step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is executed once again, following step <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> At this point, let us summarize once again the procedural principle of the mass estimation: The mass estimation is based on the evaluation for drive procedures (step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>). Using second vehicle motion variable phiaxAntrieb and the value range defined by the two threshold values S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is first ascertained whether a lightly loaded or a heavily loaded or an overloaded vehicle is present in the currently to be evaluated drive procedure. As a function of the result obtained thereby, counting unit ZKlasse1, ZKlasse2 or ZKlasse3 is implemented as appropriate for the respective loading state of the vehicle. In order to make the monitoring of the pressure sensor independent of individual misestimations, which can certainly happen in case unfavorable boundary conditions are present, a counting unit function is integrated into the mass estimation, so that altogether several drive procedures have to be evaluated, before a definitive statement is at hand, as to which loading state applies to the vehicle. The number of drive procedures to be evaluated is determined by threshold values S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> it is provided that threshold values S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, having different values, are used for individual counting units ZKlasse1, ZKlasse2 and ZKlasse3 However, in practice these threshold values all have the same value. Thus, the loading state of the vehicle is determined by the counting unit which first exceeds this value. The values of the threshold values S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are applied to the respective vehicle. In principle, a finer subdivision with regard to the loading state of the vehicle is also possible, if this should be relevant for monitoring the pressure sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The monitoring of the pressure sensor taking place in block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is shown in the flow diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The monitoring of the pressure sensor begins with a step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, followed by a step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, on the one hand the variable FsysPass is read in, and the two limits phiaxmin and phiaxmax of the value range for the first vehicle motion variable are made available. In making available or ascertaining the two limits phiaxmin and phiaxmax, the procedure is as follows: First, the variable FSysPass is evaluated. If variable FSysPass has the value TRUE, a modified monitoring of the pressure sensor should be carried out, which is why values predefined in a fixed manner are made available for the two limits phiaxmin and phiaxmax. On the other hand, if variable FSysPass has the value FALSE, a modified monitoring of the pressure sensor should not be carried out, which is why the two limits phiaxmin and phiaxmax are ascertained as a function of mass variable MassenKlasse. For a lightly loaded vehicle, the two limits phiaxmin and phiaxmax lie closer together than for a heavily loaded vehicle, i.e. for a lightly loaded vehicle, the spread of the two limits is less than for a heavily loaded vehicle. The values predefined in a fixed manner for the two limits, which are used in the case of a modified monitoring of the pressure sensor, have an even greater spread than the limits which are used in the case of a heavily loaded vehicle. In addition, in step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> the two variables ZFBrems and FPvorF are initialized. Variable ZFBrems has the character of a counting unit. Subsequently to step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> a step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is carried out, in which first vehicle motion variable phiaxBrems is read in for the current braking action which is ascertained in block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Subsequent to step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> checks whether first vehicle motion variable phiaxBrems lies within the value range defined by the two limits phiaxmin and phiaxmax, limit phiaxmin being less than limit phiaxmax. For this, a check is made whether the first vehicle motion variable is greater than limit phiaxmax, or whether the first vehicle motion variable is less than limit phiaxmin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> that the first vehicle motion variable lies outside the value range, i.e. it is determined that the first vehicle motion variable is either greater than limit phiaxmax or less than limit phiaxmin, which means the same thing as the pressure sensor for the currently present braking action appearing to be faulty, then following step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is carried out, in which counting unit ZFBrems is increased by 1. Subsequent to step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> is carried out. On the other hand, if it is determined in step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> that the first vehicle motion variable lies within the value range, which means the same thing as the pressure sensor for the currently present braking action not seeming to be faulty, then subsequently to step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is carried out, in which counting unit ZFBrems is reduced by 1. Following step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> is also carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> counting unit ZFbrems is compared to a threshold value S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. If it is determined in step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> that counting unit ZFBrems is greater than, or equal to threshold value S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which means the same thing as the pressure sensor being recognized as faulty for several braking actions, then following step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> a step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> is carried out, in which the value TRUE is assigned to variable FPvorF, by which it is indicated that the pressure sensor was recognized as being faulty. Following step <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> is carried out, with which the core of monitoring the pressure sensor is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> determines that counting unit ZFBrems is less than threshold value S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, then a step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is carried out following step <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> checks whether counting unit ZFBrems is less than, or equal to threshold value S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. If this is the case, the pressure sensor is fault-free, on account of which, following step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> a step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is carried out, in which the value FALSE is assigned to variable FPvorF. Following step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> is also carried out. On the other hand, if step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> determines that counting unit ZFBrems is greater than threshold value S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, i.e. the value of counting unit ZFBrems lies between the two threshold values S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which means the same thing as a statement, as to whether the pressure sensor is faulty or fault-free, not yet being conclusively possible, then step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is carried out again, following step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> At this point, let the procedural principle in the actual core of the monitoring of the pressure sensor be summarized once more: This core is based on the evaluation of the braking actions (step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>). Using first vehicle motion variable phiaxBrems and the value range determined by the two limits phiaxmin and phiaxmax, it is ascertained whether the pressure sensor is faulty or not for the braking action currently to be evaluated. As a function of the result obtained therefrom, counting unit ZFBrems is increased or decreased. In order to make monitoring the pressure sensor independent of individual faulty estimates, a counting unit function is integrated, so that altogether several braking actions have to be revalued before a definitive statement can be made, as to whether a pressure sensor is faulty or not. The number of braking actions to be evaluated is determined by the value of threshold values S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, or S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> it is provided that these threshold values have different values. In practice, however, the two threshold values S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> have the same numerical value, S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> being positive and S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> negative. The values of threshold values S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are applied to any vehicle in question, for example, in preliminary tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In closing, the core of monitoring the pressure sensor according to the present invention should once more be summarized: The monitoring of the pressure sensor is based on a comparison of a vehicle longitudinal deceleration, which is calculated, with the support of a model, from the measured signal of the pressure sensor, and the actually present vehicle longitudinal deceleration, which is calculated from the measured wheel speeds. Operation of the brake pedal by the driver leads to an admission pressure, and thus, via a pressure supply to the wheel brake cylinders leads to a braking of the vehicle. If the model-supported vehicle deceleration and the actually present vehicle longitudinal deceleration do not agree, then this is an indication of a faulty pressure sensor. Since the vehicle mass influences the deceleration behavior of the vehicle, and thus also influences the monitoring of the pressure sensor, the latter is taken into account in ascertaining the value range on which monitoring the pressure sensor is based. The vehicle mass is likewise ascertained by a comparison. In this comparison, a model-supported vehicle acceleration, which is ascertained beginning with the driving torque supplied to each driven wheel, is compared to the actually present vehicle acceleration which is ascertained as a function of the wheel speeds. A difference between these two values can be attributed to the influence of the vehicle mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The monitoring according to the present invention replaces the active pressure sensor test that has been performed up to now. In this regard, the quality of the monitoring according to the present invention is better than that of the existing active tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, it should further be pointed out that the form of the exemplary embodiment selected in the description as well as the representation selected in the figures should not have any restrictive effect on the essential idea according to the present invention. </paragraph>
