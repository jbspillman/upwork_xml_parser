<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a modulator for modulating a carrier wave with an in-phase component (I component) signal and a quadrature component (Q component) and a demodulator for demodulating the in-phase component signal and quadrature component signal, particularly to a technology enabling broadband modulation and demodulation with simple control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In, for example, intelligent transport systems (ITS) used to increase traffic efficiency through exchange of information among people, vehicles and roads, consideration is being given to use of software radio that uses software to send and receive wireless signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Wireless devices such as software radios need to be equipped with modulator and demodulator units for high-frequency and/or broadband wireless communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An example configuration of a modulator-demodulator unit conventionally used for analog modulation-demodulation will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the configuration of an analog quadrature modulator provided downstream of a digital unit D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Although the digital unit D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is included in the drawing for convenience of explanation, it should be noted that the digital unit D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> would not ordinarily be a component of an analog quadrature modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the analog quadrature modulator shown in the figure, an in-phase component signal output by the digital unit D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is input to an in-phase component side mixer (MIX) MI<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a quadrature component signal output by the digital unit D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is input to a quadrature component side mixer (MIX) MQ<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, in this analog quadrature modulator, a local signal generator (OSC) OSC<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> generates a signal having the frequency of, for instance, a carrier wave signal ordinarily used in communication (carrier wave frequency) and the signal having this carrier wave frequency is output as an in-phase component carrier wave signal to the in-phase component side mixer MI<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> without modification and the signal having the carrier wave frequency is also output to a 90-degree (&deg;) phase shifter P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shifts the signal received from the local signal generator OSC<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> 90 degrees and outputs the phase-shifted signal to the quadrature component side mixer MQ<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as a quadrature component carrier wave signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The in-phase component side mixer MI<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> mixes the in-phase component carrier wave signal received from the local signal generator OSC<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the in-phase component signal received from the digital unit D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to modulate the in-phase component carrier wave signal with the in-phase component signal and outputs the resulting in-phase modulated component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The quadrature component side mixer MQ<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> mixes the quadrature component carrier wave signal received from the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the quadrature component signal received from the digital unit D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to modulate the quadrature component carrier wave signal with the quadrature component signal and outputs the resulting quadrature modulated component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In this analog quadrature modulator, the in-phase modulated component output by the in-phase component side mixer MI<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the quadrature modulated component output by the quadrature component side mixer MQ<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are synthesized and synthesized signal is output as a composite signal. The composite signal is a carrier wave frequency signal including, for example, amplitude information and phase information. By controlling the in-phase component signal and the quadrature component signal output by the digital unit D<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to modify the amplitude information and the phase information, data to be transmitted by frequency modulation, phase modulation and/or amplitude modulation can be transmitted on the carrier wave. In addition, the composite signal output by the analog quadrature modulator can be wirelessly transmitted to another party&apos;s wireless device as a wireless signal via an antenna or the like (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The configuration of an analog quadrature demodulator will now be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The analog quadrature demodulator illustrated in the drawing is input with a carrier wave frequency composite signal including amplitude information or phase information, specifically with a signal transmitted wirelessly from, for example, a wireless device with which communication is to be conducted and received wirelessly via an antenna (not shown). The received composite signal is divided and input to an in-phase component side mixer MI<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a quadrature component side mixer MQ<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Similarly to the case of the analog quadrature modulator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in this analog quadrature demodulator, a local signal generator (OSC) OSC<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates a signal of, for instance, a carrier wave frequency and the signal having this carrier wave frequency is output as an in-phase component carrier wave signal to the in-phase component side mixer MI<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> without modification and the signal having the carrier wave frequency is also output to a 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which shifts it 90 degrees and outputs the phase-shifted signal to the quadrature component side mixer MQ<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as a quadrature component carrier wave signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The in-phase component side mixer MI<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> mixes the in-phase component carrier wave signal received from the local signal generator OSC<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the composite signal to demodulate the in-phase modulated component contained in the composite signal with the in-phase component carrier wave signal and outputs the in-phase component signal produced by the demodulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The quadrature component side mixer MQ<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> mixes the quadrature component carrier wave signal received from the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the composite signal to demodulate the quadrature modulated component contained in composite signal with the quadrature component carrier wave signal and outputs the quadrature component signal produced by the demodulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The in-phase component signal and the quadrature component signal output by the analog quadrature demodulator are, for example, output to a downstream digital unit (not shown) to acquire receive data based on to the in-phase component signal and the quadrature component signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> There will now be explained a configuration for changing the carrier wave frequency used in modulation and demodulation in the analog quadrature modulator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and the analog quadrature demodulator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Carrier wave frequency change is required, for example, in a wireless device or the like that sends and receives wireless signals by switching among and using carriers of different frequencies spread over a broad band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the analog quadrature modulator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and the analog quadrature demodulator shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> configuration enabling carrier wave frequency change can conceivably be implemented, for instance, by installing voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) in place of the local signal generators OSC<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and OSC<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and controlling the voltage applied to the voltage-controlled oscillators to change the frequency of the signals (local signals) output from the voltage-controlled oscillator to the in-phase component side mixers MI<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, MI<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the 90-degree phase shifters P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With this configuration, however, the fact that the devices constituting the 90-degree phase shifters P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have frequency characteristics would make it possible to achieve accurate 90-degree phase shift only in a relatively narrow band, i.e., frequencies would be present in the required broad band at which a phase shift greater than 90 degrees or less than 90 degrees arose, making modulation-demodulation impossible over a broad band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> While it is conceivable to overcome this problem by providing multiple 90-degree phase shifters associated with different frequencies and using a switch or the like to switch to the one to be used at each frequency, this configuration would complicate the control, raise cost and increase circuit size, because it would require provision of phase shifters for the individual frequencies and also increase the number of control system signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the modulator taught by JP-A-HEI-5-207080, for example, a synthesizer generates a frequency signal for each channel and, at the time of shifting the phase of the synthesizer output 90 degrees using a variable 90-degree phase shifter, the variable 90-degree phase shifter is controlled to make the error of a detected quadrature phase zero. However, this configuration requires a circuit for detecting quadrature phase and a circuit for controlling the 90-degree phase shifter to make the quadrature phase error zero. Control therefore becomes complicated and, moreover, it is difficult to achieve high accuracy with the variable phase shifter in a high-frequency band such as the quasi-microwave band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the quadrature phase signal generator circuit taught by JP-A-HEI-10-243037, for example, in order to cause a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) to generate a signal whose phase is 90 degrees different from that of a signal output by a local oscillator (local signal), the voltage-controlled oscillator is controlled based on a comparison of the frequency difference and phase difference of the two signals. With this configuration, however, when multiple channels are used, for example, the frequency of the signal output by the voltage-controlled oscillator must be controlled every time the frequency of the local signal is switched, and phase control of the signal is also necessary. The control therefore becomes complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As explained with regard to the prior art, in a conventional modulator like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or demodulator like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, modulation or demodulation over a broad band entails complex control, requires large circuitry and increases cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention was accomplished in light of such problems of the prior art and has as its object to provide a modulator that when modulating a carrier wave with an in-phase component signal and a quadrature component signal can achieve broadband modulation with simple control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a demodulator that when demodulating a carrier wave frequency composite signal into an in-phase component signal and a quadrature component signal can achieve broadband demodulation with simple control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The modulator and demodulator according to the present invention enable reduction of circuit size and cost in comparison with the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the foregoing object, the modulator according to the invention modulates a carrier wave signal for a carrier wave signal with an in-phase component signal and modulates a carrier wave signal for a quadrature component with a quadrature component signal, in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Specifically, a fixed frequency signal generating means generates two signals of fixed frequency differing 90 degrees in phase, a variable frequency signal generating means generates a signal whose frequency can be varied according to a modulated signal to be produced, an in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means mixes one signal generated by the fixed frequency signal generating means and the signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means to generate a carrier wave signal for an in-phase component, a quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means mixes the other signal generated by the fixed frequency signal generating means and the signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means to generate a carrier wave signal for a quadrature component, an in-phase component modulating means modulates the in-phase component carrier wave signal generated by the in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means with the in-phase component signal and a quadrature component modulating means modulates the quadrature component carrier wave signal generated by the quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means with the quadrature component signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Therefore, since two fixed-frequency signals that differ 90 degrees in phase are generated, it is easy to ensure that the phase difference between the two signals is exactly 90 degrees. In addition, since the frequency of the signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means according to the frequency of the modulated signal to be produced can be controlled and changed so as to change the frequency of the carrier wave signals for the in-phase component and the quadrature component, broadband modulation can be achieved with simple control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The fixed frequency signal generating means can, for example, be constituted using a digital unit or be constituted using a local signal oscillator and a 90-degree phase shifter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one configuration of the modulator according to the present invention, the fixed frequency signal generating means is constituted using a local signal oscillator that generates a fixed frequency and a 90-degree phase shifter that shifts the phase of the signal generated by the local signal oscillator 90 degrees. In this case, one or the other of the signal generated by the local signal oscillator and the signal phase-shifted by the 90-degree phase shifter is mixed by the in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means and the remaining signal is mixed by the quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As the carrier wave signal for the in-phase component or the quadrature component there is, for example, used a signal having the frequency of a carrier wave ordinarily used in communication and when multiple carrier wave frequencies are used, the multiple carrier wave frequency signals are switched according to, for example, the communication conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The fixed frequency is not particularly limited and can be set at any of various values based on the use conditions of the modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The control for changing the frequency of the signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means according to the frequency of the modulated signal to be produced is ordinarily conducted in a mode of matching with the frequency of the carrier wave used for communication, i.e. for transmission of the frequency of the generated in-phase component carrier wave signal or the frequency of the generated quadrature component carrier wave signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means is divided into two signals having the same phase, one divided signal is mixed by the in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means, and the other divided signal is mixed by the quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means or the quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means generates the in-phase component carrier wave signal or the quadrature component carrier wave signal, unnecessary frequency components are preferably removed from the mixing result of the means by a filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The in-phase component modulating means and the quadrature component modulating means are, for example, constituted as mixers. For example, the in-phase component carrier wave signal and the in-phase component signal are mixed to produce an in-phase modulated component, and the quadrature component carrier wave signal and the quadrature component signal are mixed to produce a quadrature modulated component. The in-phase modulated component and the quadrature modulated component are, for example, synthesized to obtain a composite signal including amplitude information or phase information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further, the demodulator according to the invention demodulates an in-phase component modulated signal with an in-phase component carrier wave signal to produce an in-phase component signal, and demodulates a quadrature component modulated signal with a quadrature component carrier wave signal to produce a quadrature component signal, in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Specifically, a fixed frequency signal generating means generates two signals of fixed frequency differing 90 degrees in phase, a variable frequency signal generating means generates a signal whose frequency can be varied according to a modulated signal, an in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means mixes one signal generated by the fixed frequency signal generating means and the signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means to generate a carrier wave signal for an in-phase component, a quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means mixes the other signal generated by the fixed frequency signal generating means and the signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means to generate a carrier wave signal for a quadrature component, an in-phase component demodulating means demodulates an in-phase component modulated signal with the in-phase component carrier wave signal generated by the in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means to produce an in-phase component signal, and a quadrature component demodulating means demodulates a quadrature component modulated signal with the quadrature component carrier wave signal generated by the quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means to produce a quadrature component signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Therefore, since two fixed-frequency signals that differ 90 degrees in phase are generated, it is easy to ensure that the phase difference between the two signals is exactly 90 degrees. In addition, since the frequency of the signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means according to the frequency of the modulated signal to be demodulated can be controlled and changed so as to change the frequency of the carrier wave signals for the in-phase component and the quadrature component, broadband demodulation can be achieved with simple control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The fixed frequency signal generating means can, for example, be constituted using a digital unit or be constituted using a local signal oscillator and a 90-degree phase shifter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In one configuration of the demodulator according to the present invention, the fixed frequency signal generating means is constituted using a local signal oscillator that generates a fixed frequency and a 90-degree phase shifter that shifts the phase of the signal generated by the local signal oscillator 90 degrees. In this case, one or the other of the signals generated by the local signal oscillator and the signal phase-shifted by the 90-degree phase shifter is mixed by the in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means and the remaining signal is mixed by the quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Although the general practice is for the in-phase component modulated signal or the quadrature component modulated signal to be processed for demodulation in the form of, for example, a composite signal synthesizing the two component modulated signals, the two component modulated signals can instead be processed in the form of separate signals. In this case, too, the component signal of each component modulated signal can be demodulated with the corresponding component carrier wave signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As the carrier wave signal for the in-phase component or the quadrature component there is, for example, used a signal having the same frequency as the in-phase component or quadrature component modulated signal to be demodulated and when modulated signals of multiple frequencies are demodulated, the carrier wave signals of these multiple frequencies are switched according to, for example, the communication conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The fixed frequency is not particularly limited and can be set at any of various values based on the use conditions of the demodulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The control for changing the frequency of the signal generated by the variable frequency signal generating means according to the frequency of the demodulated is ordinarily conducted in a mode of matching the frequency of the generated in-phase component carrier wave signal or the frequency of the generated quadrature component carrier wave signal with the frequency of the modulated signal to be demodulated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A demodulator that is a first embodiment of the invention will be explained first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the configuration of the analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment provided downstream of a digital unit D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Although the digital unit D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is included in the drawing for convenience of explanation, it should be noted that the digital unit D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not ordinarily a component of the analog quadrature modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The illustrated analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment comprises a local signal oscillator OSC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that constitute a processing unit for generating a basic local signal, a voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constituting a processing unit for generating a secondary local signal, an in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and second mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, filter FQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment, an in-phase component signal output by the digital unit D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is input to the in-phase component side second mixer MI<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a quadrature component signal output by the digital unit D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is input to the quadrature component side second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The local signal oscillator OSC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> generates a signal (basic local signal) f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose frequency constitutes a basic carrier wave frequency and outputs the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The basic carrier wave frequency has a fixed frequency, e.g., has a frequency preset to avoid spurious interference and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shifts the phase of the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> received from the local signal oscillator OSC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> 90 degrees and outputs the phase-shifted signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; to the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The voltage applied to the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is, for example, controlled by a control unit provided in the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to generate a signal (secondary local signal) f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a frequency corresponding to the applied voltage. The signal f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is output to the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The frequency of the signal f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> generated by the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled based on the frequency of the modulated signal to be generated, i.e., the frequency used for communication (transmission). The functional means for controlling the frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> based on the modulated signal to be generated can, for example, be provided at an arbitrary location in the communication device equipped with the analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> One or both of the transmission lines from the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is/are finely adjusted in the length of the path pattern, for example, so as to set the two transmission lines to the same phase. In other words, they are set to make the phase of the signal f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sent from the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the phase of the signal f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sent from the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mixes the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> received from the local signal oscillator OSC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the signal f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> received from the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the mixing result to the in-phase component side filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The mixing result output from the first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes, for example, a signal having a frequency corresponding to the difference &verbar;F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&minus;F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&verbar; between the frequency F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the local signal oscillator OSC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the frequency F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the signal f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (difference frequency signal) and signal having a frequency corresponding to the sum &verbar;F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&verbar; of the frequencies F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (sum frequency signal). It also includes, for example, leaked signals from the signals f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> received by the first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that have frequencies F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> identical with those of the received signals f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (local leak frequency signals). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The in-phase component side filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> removes unnecessary frequency components from the mixing result received from the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by filtering and outputs the filtered signal fLO to the in-phase component side second mixer MI<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as an in-phase component carrier wave signal. In this embodiment, one or the other of the aforesaid difference frequency signal and sum frequency signal is output to the second mixer MI<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the in-phase component carrier wave signal fLO removed of unnecessary frequency components. On the other hand, the remaining one of the difference frequency signal and the sum frequency signal (the image frequency signal component) is removed as an unnecessary frequency component by the filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the characteristics of the filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are set so that the local leak frequency signals are also removed by the filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> An ordinary band-pass filter or any of various other filters can be used for the filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the image frequency is high, for example, a low-pass filter can be used, and when the image frequency is low, a high-pass filter can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The in-phase component side second mixer MI<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mixes the in-phase component carrier wave signal fLO received from the in-phase component side filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an in-phase component signal received from the digital unit D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the result of modulating the in-phase component carrier wave signal with the in-phase component signal as an in-phase modulated component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, filter FQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> conduct processing similar to that conducted by the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and second mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mixes the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; received from the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the signal f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> received from the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the mixing result to the quadrature component side filter FQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The quadrature component side filter FQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which may have the same frequency characteristics as the in-phase component side filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, removes unnecessary frequency components from the mixing result received from the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by filtering and outputs the filtered signal fLO&prime; to the quadrature component side second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as a quadrature component carrier wave signal. As the quadrature component carrier wave signal there is used, for example, a signal that has the same frequency and amplitude as the in-phase component carrier wave signal but whose phase is shifted 90 degrees relative thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The quadrature component side second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mixes the quadrature component carrier wave signal fLO&prime; received from the quadrature component side filter FQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a quadrature component signal received from the digital unit D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the result of modulating the quadrature component carrier wave signal with the quadrature component signal as a quadrature modulated component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The in-phase modulated component output by the in-phase component side second mixer MI<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the quadrature modulated component output by the quadrature component side second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are then synthesized by a synthesizer (not shown), for example, and the synthesis result is output as a composite signal. The composite signal output by the analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment is wirelessly transmitted from an antenna (not shown) to, for instance, the wireless device of another party with which communication is to be conducted. The frequency of the composite signal output by the analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment is changed according to the communication conditions and the like by controlling the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to vary the frequency thereof. This enables modulation over a broad band, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The analog quadrature modulator according to this embodiment can thus conduct modulation over a broad frequency range by simple control even when incorporated in a wireless device or the like that transmits/receives signals over a broad band, without increasing the number of control system signals, cost or circuit size. Since the frequency of the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose phase is shifted by the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fixed, moreover, the accuracy of the 90-degree phase shift by the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be ensured. The analog quadrature modulator according this embodiment can, for example, control the modulation processing over a broad band merely by conventional frequency control, e.g., by controlling the frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the frequency of the composite signal to be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the local signal oscillator OSC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constitute the fixed frequency signal generating means, the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constitutes the variable frequency signal generating means, the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and filter FI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constitute the in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means, the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and filter FQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constitute the quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means, the in-phase component side second mixer MI<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constitutes the in-phase component modulating means, and the quadrature component side second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constitutes the quadrature component modulating means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A modulator that is a second embodiment of the invention will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the configuration of the analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment provided downstream of a digital unit D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Although the digital unit D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is included in the drawing for convenience of explanation, it should be noted that the digital unit D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not ordinarily a component of the analog quadrature modulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The illustrated analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment comprises a digital unit D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constituting a processing unit for generating a basic local signal, a voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constituting a processing unit for generating a secondary local signal, an in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, filter FI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and second mixer MI<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, filter FQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment, an in-phase component signal output by the digital unit D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is input to the in-phase component side second mixer MI<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a quadrature component signal output by the digital unit D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is input to the quadrature component side second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The configuration and operation of the analog quadrature modulator of this embodiment are the same as the configuration and operation of the analog quadrature modulator according to the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except for the point that the digital unit D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> generates the basic carrier wave frequency signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the point that the digital unit D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> generates the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; equivalent to a signal obtained by shifting the phase of the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> 90 degrees and outputs the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; to the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i.e., except for the configuration for generating the basic local signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, since the frequencies of the basic local signals f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; input to the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are fixed, when the frequency is a relatively low one of, for example, 100 MHz or lower, it is easily possible, in consideration of spurious interference and the like, to have the digital unit D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> output the basic local signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the in-phase component and the basic local signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; for the quadrature component as digital signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Thus the analog quadrature modulator according to this embodiment can, as was explained earlier regarding the analog quadrature modulator according to the first embodiment, also conduct modulation over a wide band with simple control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the digital unit D<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> constitutes the fixed frequency signal generating means. </paragraph>

When the frequency of the composite signal input to the analog quadrature demodulator of this embodiment varies, demodulation can be conducted over a broad band in response to the frequency variation of the composite signal by controlling the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to vary its frequency according to the frequency of the composite signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The analog quadrature demodulator according to this embodiment can thus conduct demodulation over a broad frequency range by simple control even when incorporated in a wireless device or the like that transmits/receives signals over a broad band, without increasing the number of control system signals, cost or circuit size. Since the frequency of the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whose phase is shifted by the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fixed, moreover, the accuracy of the 90-degree phase shift by the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be ensured. The analog quadrature demodulator according this embodiment can, for example, control the demodulation processing over a broad band merely by conventional frequency control, e.g., by controlling the frequency of the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> according to the frequency of the composite signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the local signal oscillator OSC<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the 90-degree phase shifter P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constitute the fixed frequency signal generating means, the voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constitutes the variable frequency signal generating means, the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and filter FI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constitute the in-phase component carrier wave signal generating means, the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and filter FQ<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> constitute the quadrature component carrier wave signal generating means, the in-phase component side second mixer MI<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> constitutes the in-phase component demodulating means, and the quadrature component side second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> constitutes the quadrature component demodulating means.

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A demodulator that is a fourth embodiment of the present invention will now be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the configuration of the analog quadrature demodulator of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The illustrated analog quadrature demodulator of this embodiment comprises a digital unit D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> constituting a processing unit for generating a basic local signal, a voltage-controlled oscillator VCO<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> constituting a processing unit for generating a secondary local signal, an in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, filter FI<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and second mixer MI<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, filter FQ<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The analog quadrature demodulator of this embodiment is input with a composite signal transmitted wirelessly from, for example, a wireless device with which communication is to be conducted and received wirelessly via an antenna (not shown). The composite signal is divided by a distributor (not shown), for example. One divided signal is input to the in-phase component side second mixer MI<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the other divided signal is input to the quadrature component side second mixer MQ<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The configuration and operation of the analog quadrature demodulator of this embodiment are the same as the configuration and operation of the analog quadrature demodulator according to the third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, except for the point that the digital unit D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates the basic carrier wave frequency signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and outputs the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the point that the digital unit D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; equivalent to a signal obtained by shifting the phase of the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> 90 degrees and outputs the signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; to the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, i.e., except for the configuration for generating the basic local signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, since the frequencies of the basic local signals f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; input to the in-phase component side first mixer MI<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the quadrature component side first mixer MQ<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are fixed, when the frequency is a relatively low one of, for example, 100 MHz or lower, it is easily possible, in consideration of spurious interference and the like, to have the digital unit D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> output the basic local signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the in-phase component and the basic local signal f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; for the quadrature component as digital signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Thus the analog quadrature demodulator according to this embodiment can, as was explained earlier regarding the analog quadrature demodulator according to the third embodiment, also conduct demodulation over a wide band with simple control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the digital unit D<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> constitutes the fixed frequency signal generating means. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In addition, the field of application of the invention is not limited to that discussed in the foregoing and application in various other fields is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The modulator and demodulator of this invention are suitable for application in, for example, in the wireless communication devices of mobile communication systems such the wireless communication devices of an intelligent transport system, a mobile phone system and a Personal Handy phone System (PHS). However, they can also be applied in the communication equipment of various other kinds of systems. Moreover, application is not limited to wireless communication and application to wire communication is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In addition, the various types of processing performed in the modulator and demodulator according to this invention may be constituted by being implemented in hardware resources equipped with a processor and memory and the like, for example, being controlled by means of a processor executing a control program stored in ROM (Read Only Memory). Further, the various functional means for executing this processing may also be constituted as independent physical circuits. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As explained in the foregoing, the modulator according to the present invention is adapted such that, when modulating an in-phase component carrier wave signal with an in-phase component signal and modulating a quadrature component carrier wave signal with a quadrature component signal, it generates two basic local signals of fixed frequency differing 90 degrees in phase, generates a secondary local signal whose frequency can be varied according to a modulated signal to be produced, mixes one basic local signal and the secondary local signal to generate a carrier wave signal for an in-phase component, mixes the other basic local signal and the secondary local signal to generate a carrier wave signal for a quadrature component, modulates the generated in-phase component carrier wave signal with the in-phase component signal and modulates the generated quadrature component carrier wave signal with the quadrature component signal. Broadband modulation can therefore be achieved with simple control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The demodulator according to the present invention is adapted such that, when demodulating an in-phase component modulated signal with an in-phase component carrier wave signal to produce an in-phase component signal and demodulating a quadrature component modulated signal with a quadrature component carrier wave signal to produce a quadrature component signal, it generates two basic local signals of fixed frequency differing 90 degrees in phase, generates a secondary local signal whose frequency can be varied according to a modulated signal, mixes one basic local signal and the secondary local signal to generate a carrier wave signal for an in-phase component, mixes the other basic local signal and the secondary local signal to generate a carrier wave signal for a quadrature component, demodulates an in-phase component modulated signal with the generated in-phase component carrier wave signal to produce an in-phase component signal, and demodulates a quadrature component modulated signal with the generated quadrature component carrier wave signal to produce a quadrature component signal.
