<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An A/D conversion reference level is applied to an input of a variable offset comparator (i.e. VOC). A binary number that corresponds to the A/D conversion reference level is determined by changing a binary variable that is applied to vary the offset of the VOC until the VOC output changes states. The same procedure is applied to determine corresponding reference, binary numbers for all of the other A/D conversion reference levels. A successive approximation procedure (binary search) is then performed for a reference window in which an input analog level (to be converted into digital form) would fall, by successively applying the reference binary numbers to vary the VOC offset. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This invention is in general related to analog to digital (i.e., A/D) converters and more particularly to successive approximation A/D converters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A/D converters are used to convert an input analog voltage into an output digital (or binary) value. There are a number of different, known A/D conversion techniques, each having certain advantages which make it suitable for a particular application. In the successive approximation technique, the input, analog voltage is successively compared to some of a number of predefined, reference voltages using a comparator. The comparator has inverting and non-inverting voltage inputs, where one is to receive the input, analog voltage and the other is to successively receive some of the reference voltages. These reference voltages are typically evenly spaced between a lower voltage and an upper voltage (which are typically the voltages of the power supply and return nodes, respectively, used by the A/D converter), to define a number of non-overlapping voltage windows between the lower and upper voltages. Each voltage window is assigned a unique, digital value. A goal of the comparison process is to determine which voltage window contains the input, analog voltage, by performing a binary search. Each cycle of the search yields one bit, starting with the most significant bit, and with each cycle moves closer to the voltage window that contains the input voltage. The digital value assigned to this window is thus the output, digital value that represents the conversion of the input, analog voltage.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An A/D conversion process and an A/D converter are described which use a variable offset comparator (i.e., VOC). According to an embodiment, the VOC has a substantially variable, digitally controllable offset and can be implemented using a standard, digital complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (i.e. CMOS) fabrication process, on the same integrated circuit chip as large scale integration logic. Use of the VOC with digitally controllable offset permits easy calibration of the A/D conversion process, to cancel inaccuracy inducing effects such as device mismatch and comparator offsets. Additionally, power consumption may be reduced in the A/D converter since the VOC does not require the analog, A/D conversion reference levels to be available during normal operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a flow diagram of an embodiment of an A/D conversion process in which an input analog level is converted into an output digital value. The process begins with operation <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by applying an A/D conversion reference level to an input of the VOC. This reference level may be, for example, a voltage selected from a number of equi-spaced voltages, such as the exemplary seven (7) reference levels shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The VOC has a substantially variable offset that is controllable to represent an implied, variable voltage (which may also be referred to as an implied, VOC reference voltage) against which the input voltage is effectively, but not actually, compared by the VOC. The VOC has an offset control input to receive an offset code that may be a binary number. For example, as an eight bit binary number, the offset code can range from decimal 0 to 255. The implied, VOC reference voltage is varied by changing the offset code fed to the VOC from 0 to 255. Different embodiments of the VOC are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/895,625, filed Jun. 29, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Variable Offset Amplifier&rdquo;, which is assigned to the same assignee as that of the present application. The A/D conversion process continues with operation <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In operation <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the offset code that corresponds to the reference level is determined. This can be done by sweeping the offset code that is being applied to the offset control input of the VOC, simultaneously with applying the reference level to the VOC input. The VOC output, which, for example, may exhibit either a logic &lsquo;1&rsquo; or logic &lsquo;0&rsquo; value, is monitored to detect when it changes states. When the output changes states, the offset code that caused this change is captured and recorded (operation <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). This recorded offset code corresponds to the reference level being applied to the VOC input, and may be referred to as a reference offset code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Operations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are then repeated for all other A/D conversion reference levels (see, for example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), so that a number of corresponding, reference offset codes are determined. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the VOC should be designed so that its input voltage range exceeds that of the A/D conversion reference levels, to properly convert the reference levels into their corresponding, reference offset codes. In addition, the offset resolution of the VOC (i.e., the step size or least significant bit of the offset code, represented, for example, in volts) will impact the accuracy of the A/D conversion. Smaller step size in the offset code translates into more accurate representations of the A/D reference levels, which in turn yields more accurate A/D conversions. Other techniques for determining the offset code representation of the A/D conversion reference levels, using the VOC, can alternatively be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Once the reference offset codes have been determined in operation <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the input analog level to be converted is applied to the VOC input. Note that the A/D conversion reference levels are not needed during the actual conversion process, since the reference offset codes are sufficient to set the implied reference levels in the VOC. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the input analog level is a voltage between 5V/8 and 6V/8. The process continues with operation <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> where a search is performed for the reference window in which the input analog level falls. The reference window is defined by a pair of adjacent, reference levels (or their corresponding offset codes). The search may be performed by successively applying some of the reference offset codes to the offset control input of the VOC over a number of cycles, simultaneously with the input analog level being applied the VOC input. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there are three cycles. A different reference offset code is applied in each cycle of the search, as represented by the bold line. A result of the comparison between the input analog level and the VOC reference in each cycle is recorded. For the embodiment in which the VOC output provides either a logic &lsquo;1&rsquo; or a logic &lsquo;0&rsquo; as the result of the comparison, each cycle yields one bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment, the search is a conventional, binary search. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a binary search sequence. Such a search may in general require N cycles, where N will be the number of bits in the output digital value. Each cycle results in the determination of one bit of the output, multi-bit digital value, starting with the most significant bit and monotonically reducing in significance, to end with a least significant bit of the output digital value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, beginning with the first cycle, the full range between the lowest and highest reference offset codes is divided into two, essentially equal, parts. After setting the VOC offset to the reference code that is closest to the midpoint of the range, the VOC is enabled to resolve the comparison, and its output indicates in which part the input analog level lies. The part that does not have the input analog level is then rejected. The process then repeats in the next and subsequent cycles, where the accepted part from a previous cycle is divided into two equal parts and a determination is made as to which part contains the input analog level. This repetitive process continues in successive cycles, until the smallest part has been found (here, in cycle &num;3). This smallest part is the reference window (between two adjacent, reference offset codes) which contains the analog input level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the search for the reference window has been completed, and a sequence of bits deemed the output digital value that represents the input analog level have been obtained from the VOC output during the search, the process ends with operation <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in which the sequence of bits is converted into a parallel word. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows all of the possible output digital values for an N&equals;3 bit conversion process, and their corresponding reference windows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram of an embodiment of an A/D converter. The converter includes a VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> that has a substantially variable offset controllable via a digital, offset control input. A pair of inverting and non-inverting input terminals (also referred to as a differential input) are coupled to receive the input analog level to be converted. The offset control input of the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is coupled to receive an offset code, which may be a binary number, from a successive approximation control circuit (i.e., SAC) <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> has an input coupled to an output of the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is to apply some of a number of reference offset codes, that correspond to a number of predetermined, A/D conversion reference levels, to the offset control input. According to an embodiment, the SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> applies the reference offset codes in accordance with a conventional, binary search for a reference window in which the input analog level would fall. The SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may be implemented according to conventional, hardwired logic components including, for example, a state machine that responds to each, current offset code setting and VOC output value by generating the next offset code setting (as required by the search). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Performing the binary search results in the output digital value being provided as a sequence of bits at the output of the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. A serial to parallel converter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is coupled to the output of the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, to deliver a parallel word from the sequence of bits, to complete the A/D conversion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To improve the accuracy of the conversion process, a sample and hold circuit <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> may be added, its output being coupled to ensure that a fixed voltage is fed to the input of the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> during the conversion process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The conversion process performed by the A/D converter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> obtains the predetermined, reference offset codes using a reference initialization control circuit (i.e., RIC) <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The RIC <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be designed, using once again conventional, logic components, to implement the process described above in operations <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. During such a reference initialization process, the RIC <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> sequentially selects a reference level from those provided by a reference generator <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, to be fed to the input of the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The reference generator <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may, for example, be a resistor string with pass-gate multiplexers. Such a circuit provides any one of a number of reference voltages (such as, for example, the seven (7) levels shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) at its output, as selected by the RIC <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. A two input multiplexer (i.e. MUX) <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> provides either the reference voltage or the input analog voltage to the input of the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, depending upon the mode of operation, i.e. reference initialization mode or successive approximation mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The RIC <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> cooperate with each other so that the offset code to the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is properly set, to achieve the goals of the reference initialization and successive approximation modes, respectively. For instance, in the reference initialization mode, the SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is essentially disabled while the RIC <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> determines each of the reference codes. This is done by, for example, sweeping the binary variable that is applied to the offset control input of the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, while a selected reference level is being applied to he VOC input, until the VOC output changes states. The value of the variable is captured and recorded in response to and as soon as the output changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this figure depicts a block diagram of an embodiment of an electronic system featuring the A/D converter. The electronic system has a communication link that features an equalization loop as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/967,804, filed Sep. 28, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Equalization of a Transmission Line Signal Using a Variable Offset Comparator&rdquo;. An A/D converter as described above is integrated with the equalization loop, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> which will be described below. The system in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has a multi-layer printed wiring board <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> on which a parallel bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is formed. The bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> may be of the point to point variety, or a multi-drop bus such as those used in a main memory. An integrated circuit (IC) chip package <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is operatively installed on the board to communicate using the parallel bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The installation of the package <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> may be done by a surface mount technique or via a connector or socket. The package has an IC chip <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> that includes a logic function section, and an I/O section as an interface between the logic function section and the bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The logic function suction may be one of the following well-known devices: a microprocessor, a memory controller, and a bus bridge. Alternatively, other devices that can be implemented in the logic function section of an IC chip may be used. The I/O section has a bus receiver in which an equalization loop is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A second IC package <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is also installed on the board <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to communicate with the first package <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> via the bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The second IC package <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> also includes a chip <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> having an I/O section in which a bus receiver is provided to interface the bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, and its own logic function section (here shown as a memory controller). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment, the I/O interfaces of the two chips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> communicate with each other bi-directionally, that is using the same conductive lines of the bus for both transmitting and receiving data. Thus, in such an embodiment, drivers are provided, in both IC chips, that are connected to the same conductive lines of the bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. Other system applications of the equalization loop are possible, including, for example, a cable receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, this figure illustrates a block diagram of how the A/D converter may be integrated into an equalization loop in the I/O section of the IC die <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also shows that the equalization loop connects to a transmission line <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> (representing part of the parallel bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) which is driven by a driver <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> in the IC die <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The MUX <highlight><bold>617</bold></highlight>, pulse generator <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, the equalization loop and their operation are described, in detail, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/967,804 identified above, and therefore need not be further discussed here, except to note how the SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> may be integrated into the loop. The output of the SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is fed to an input of a MUX <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight>. Additional inputs of the MUX <highlight><bold>619</bold></highlight> are used by the filter <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> and filter calibration control circuit (i.e. FCC) <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>. The SAC <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, FCC <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, and filter <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> are designed to cooperate with each other such that each can control the offset code that is fed to the VOC <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, to achieve the respective goals of A/D conversion (as described above in the present application), filter calibration, and equalization. In addition, the RIC <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, reference generator <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and MUX <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) may be added into the IC die <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> to provide an additional input to the sampler <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>. This gives an on-chip capability of determining the A/D conversion reference offset codes. </paragraph>
