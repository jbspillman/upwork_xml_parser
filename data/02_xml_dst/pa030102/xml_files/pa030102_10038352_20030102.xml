<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates most generally to semiconductor devices and methods for manufacturing the same. More particularly, the present invention provides a method and structure for preventing base groups from becoming nested in low-k dielectric materials and subsequently rendering photoresists insoluble. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Deep ultra-violet (DUV) lithography is widely used in the fabrication of advanced VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) semiconductor devices. Chemically amplified DUV photoresists improve the performance of the lithography systems and improve device feature resolution. Low dielectric constant (low-k) dielectrics are favored in today&apos;s semiconductor manufacturing industry because of the performance improvements they provide by way of reducing parasitic capacitance, reducing propagation delay and therefore increasing device speed. The use of copper interconnect features is also favored to reduce line resistance of the interconnect lines. Typical copper interconnect schemes incorporate damascene manufacturing techniques to define the interconnect paths. A dual damascene approach is favored because it provides lower cost processing, improved level-to-level alignment tolerance and thus allows for tighter design rules and improved performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A shortcoming associated with the use of low-k dielectrics in conjunction with copper interconnect lines and chemically amplified photoresists used in DUV lithography, is that base groups which become nested in porous low-k dielectric materials, can interact with the acid catalysts included in chemically amplified photoresists to render the exposed photoresist insoluble in developer. This unwanted residual photoresist distorts the pattern being formed and is difficult to remove. Base groups such as amines or other N&mdash;H base groups, are typically produced in association with conventional hard mask films, etch stop layers and barrier films used in the film stack that also includes the low-k dielectric films, and which is advantageously used in dual damascene processing. Etch stop layers and barrier films are commonly nitrogen-containing films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore desirable to enjoy the benefits provided by copper interconnect technology, low-k dielectric films and chemically amplified photoresists in DUV lithography systems, without degrading the chemically amplified photoresist by interaction with base groups from low-k dielectric films. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

The present invention provides an oxygen-containing layer disposed directly between the low-k dielectric layer and the nitrogen base layer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method and structure for utilizing low-k dielectric films in a film stack commonly used in dual-damascene, VLSI (very large scale integration) processing technology. The film stack may include, in various exemplary embodiments, a hard mask film, an etch-stop film, and a barrier layer film. The film stack may be formed over a conductive interconnect wire or another substructure. The etch-stop layer, hard mask layer, and barrier layer may each be nitrogen base layers which include N&mdash;H base groups that are capable of diffusing therefrom. The nitrogen base layers may be nitrogen-containing films such as silicon nitride (SiN) or nitrogen-doped silicon carbide (SiC&mdash;N). Typical deposition chemistries used to form these nitride and carbide films include or produce ammonia, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, which readily diffuses into and throughout the low-k dielectric material. The hardmask layer may be a silicon oxide film formed using nitrogen and nitrous oxide in the film formation chemistry. The hard mask, etch-stop layer and barrier layer may be formed using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) techniques, but other methods may be used alternatively. Ammonia or other nitrogen-containing gasses may be included as source gasses during the film formation process using PECVD. Ammonia, various amines and other N&mdash;H base groups such as amino-silanes may be used in the film-formation chemistry and/or may be by-products. According to conventional technologies, these species may diffuse into and throughout the porous low-k dielectric during the formation of the hard mask, etch-stop and barrier layer films, or these species may diffuse into the porous low-k dielectric materials after the film formation process is complete. Generally speaking, various amines, amino-silanes and other N&mdash;H base groups such as produced during the formation of the hardmask, etch-stop and barrier layer films can diffuse into the low-k dielectric films which typically bound the aforementioned films. The present invention provides an oxygen-containing film such as a TEOS oxide film directly between the low-k dielectric and the adjacent hardmask, etch-stop, barrier layer, or other nitrogen base films. The oxygen-containing film suppresses the diffusion of N&mdash;H and other base groups into the low-k dielectric films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to conventional arrangements in the prior art, the oxygen-containing, diffusion suppressing films are not present and the N&mdash;H bases or other base species diffuse into and throughout the typically porous low-k dielectric materials. From the low-k dielectric materials, these base species can diffuse into the photoresist materials which contact the low-k dielectric layers. This is illustrated in the prior art arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a PRIOR ART arrangement of opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> formed within a film stack. The film stack may include low-k dielectric films <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which may be relatively porous films. The film stack also includes exemplary barrier layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, exemplary etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> and exemplary hard mask layer <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, one or more of barrier layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>, and hard mask layer <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> may be a film such as a nitrogen-containing film and formed using ammonia or other gases which produce N&mdash;H base species during the film formation process and/or in the formed film. According to the exemplary embodiment in which PECVD is used to form the films, ammonia or other nitrogen gasses may be included as constituents of the plasma chemistry used to form the film. Amines or other N&mdash;H base groups may also be present in the plasma. As such, during the film formation process or subsequent to the formation of the film, various amines, amino-silanes and other N&mdash;H base groups may diffuse from barrier layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>, and hard mask layer <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> into low-k dielectric films <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Such diffusion of basic N&mdash;H species is indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this manner, N&mdash;H base groups become nested within porous low-k dielectric layers <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> includes exposed sidewalls <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> of low-k dielectric materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Still referring to the PRIOR ART structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, according to the dual-damascene processing scheme commonly used in VLSI processing, after opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is formed, another damascene opening is formed in the film stack, and aligned over opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> to produce a dual-damascene or two-tiered opening. Such an opening is preferably formed by coating the substrate with a DUV photoresist film, then exposing portions of the preferably chemically amplified photoresist. Chemically amplified photoresist <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is formed over the film stack and fills opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Conventional photomask <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> includes transmissive sections <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and opaque sections <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Using DUV lithography, ultra-violet light shines through transmissive sections <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and desirably activates the acid catalysts in the DUV, chemically amplified photoresist <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to break bonds in the photoresist structure and render the photoresist soluble in developer. Portions <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> beneath opaque sections <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of photomask <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> are not exposed and are therefore not soluble in developer. The entirety of photoresist sections under clear section <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> of mask <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are desired to be rendered soluble in developer through acid catalyst activation by ultra-violet light. Portion <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is such a soluble section. In the embodiment in which a dual-damascene opening is to be formed over existing opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, all portions of photoresist film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> within opening <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are desirably exposed and developed. Within section <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, however, base groups from the low-k dielectric films <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, diffuse through sidewalls <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> and into photoresist <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. These amine, N&mdash;H base groups interact with and neutralize the acid catalyst of the DUV photoresist. The neutralized acid catalysts are therefore not activated when exposed by DUV light. As such, portion <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> is rendered insoluble in developer and will remain and distort the pattern according to conventional methods of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an exemplary film stack according to the present invention. Substructure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, over which the exemplary film stack of the present invention is formed. Surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be the surface of a semiconductor substrate or the surface of a feature such as a conductive line, formed over such a substrate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> includes low-k dielectric films <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Exemplary low-k dielectric films <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may each be formed using PECVD, or other suitable techniques for forming a low-k dielectric film such as available in the art. Low-k dielectric films are characterized by a dielectric constant being less than the dielectric constant of silicon dioxide which is typically about 3.9-4.1. In an exemplary embodiment, the low-k dielectric films may include a dielectric constant that is less than 3.5 Low-k dielectric films are desirably porous, since the incorporation of vacuum having a dielectric contrast of about 1.0, lowers the overall dielectric constant of the low-k dielectric film. In an exemplary embodiment, the low-k dielectric film may be an organo-silicate-glass (OSG). According to an exemplary embodiment, the low-k dielectric material may be a porous low-k dielectric such as SiOC&mdash;H, such as may be formed using tetra-methyl-cyclo-tetrasiloxane, oxygen and carbon dioxide using a PECVD-process. According to another exemplary embodiment, the low-k dielectric may be a spin-on aromatic carbon with porogen, that is subsequently baked to create pores. According to other exemplary embodiments, commercially available OSG materials such as Black Diamond (Applied Materials Corporation), Coral (Novellus), FlowFill (Trikon) and Eagel2 (ASM). Such low-k dielectric materials are intended to be exemplary only, and other low-k dielectric films may be used according to other exemplary embodiments. The thicknesses of low-k dielectric films <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> will vary according to the particular embodiment and may range from 1000 to 10000 angstroms in various exemplary embodiments. Other thicknesses may be used according to other exemplary embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The film structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is intended to be exemplary only and the exemplary film stack is suited for use in dual-damascene VLSI processing. According to this exemplary embodiment, the film stack includes barrier layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and hardmask layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Each of these layers may be considered a &ldquo;nitrogen base layer&rdquo; such as a silicon nitride film, a nitrogen-doped silicon carbide film, or other nitrogen containing films. According to another exemplary embodiment, films <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be nitrogen base layers that do not contain nitrogen as a component of the formed film, but may use nitrogen-containing species such as ammonia, nitrous oxide or molecular nitrogen in the formation of the film and thus will include N&mdash;H or other nitrogen-including base groups as by-products of the film formation process. In an exemplary embodiment, hardmask film layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be a silicon oxide film formed using silane, nitrous oxide and nitrogen in a PECVD formation process. Each of layers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are designated nitrogen base layers and include N&mdash;H base groups therein which are capable of diffusing out of the respective layers. The films may each be formed using PECVD techniques and may include ammonia, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, in the plasma chemistry in an exemplary embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In another exemplary embodiment, the nitrogen base layer that includes N&mdash;H base groups therein and which are capable of diffusing therefrom, may be the surface of another exemplary film, for example a film treated with ammonia or other nitrogen containing chemistries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Barrier layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes top surface <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes top surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and hard mask layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Generally speaking, one or all of layers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> include base groups such as amines or other N&mdash;H base groups which are capable of diffusing from the respective films into low-k dielectric films <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> during or after film formation, if not suppressed. The N&mdash;H base groups become nested in the desirably porous low-k dielectric films. Films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> suppress such diffusion and maintain any such base groups within respective layers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are oxygen-containing films. According to an exemplary embodiment, such oxygen-containing films may be formed using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of an oxide layer using TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) and oxygen. Such oxygen-containing films formed using these constituents are commonly referred to as TEOS films or TEOS oxide films, in the art. As such, an oxygen-containing film formed using tetraethyl orthosilicate and oxygen will be hereinafter referred to as a TEOS film. In an exemplary embodiment, the TEOS film may include a thickness within the range of <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> angstroms, but various other thicknesses may be used in other exemplary embodiments. According to other exemplary embodiments, oxygen-containing films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be formed using other suitable methods which produce oxygen-containing films and preferably do not generate amines, amino-silanes or other N&mdash;H base groups during the film formation process. Oxide films other than TEOS films may be used according to other exemplary embodiments. According to one exemplary embodiment, the oxygen-containing film may be oxygen-doped silicon carbide. Oxygen containing film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes upper surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The structure in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is intended to be exemplary only and various other numbers of low-k dielectric films and various other nitrogen base layers or other base-containing source films may be used according to other exemplary embodiments. The nitrogen base layers may include nitrogen as a component or they may include N&mdash;H or other base groups produced during formation of the film. The nitrogen base layers may serve as hardmask films, barrier layer films, etch stop layers or other films which serve other electrical or structural functions. A fundamental concept of the present invention is that each adjacent film set of a low-k dielectric film and a nitrogen base layer, is separated by a TEOS or other oxygen-containing film, which suppresses diffusion of base species from the base-containing source films to the low-k dielectric material. The TEOS or other oxygen-containing film is advantageously formed directly between the low-k dielectric film and base-containing source film and forms a conterminous boundary with each. In another exemplary embodiment, the nitrogen base layer may be the surface of another film which includes amines or other N&mdash;H base groups on its surface after it has been treated with an ammonia-containing plasma, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of an exemplary substructure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> over which the film stack of the present invention may be formed. Exemplary substructure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes conductive lines <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and insulating material <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Conductive lines <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be formed of copper or other suitable conductive materials. Surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is generally planar and conductive lines <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> extend down from surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the embodiment shown. Damascene processing including chemical mechanical polishing may be used to provide conductive lines <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> within generally planar surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Insulating material <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be a low-k dielectric or other dielectric material. Substructure <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is intended to be exemplary only and other substructures may be used alternatively. As will be shown in the subsequent figures, the exemplary film stack shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is preferably formed over a conductive wire as an opening may be formed through the exemplary film stack to contact the subjacent conductive wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view showing an opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed through the exemplary film stack shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> extends down from top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of hardmask layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and extends through hardmask layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, upper low-k dielectric film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, lower low-k dielectric film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and terminates on oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes bottom <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which is part of upper surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Barrier layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be formed over a conductive material, separating oxygen containing layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from a subjacent conductive line, such as conductive lines <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for example. Various suitable means such as plasma etching may be used to form opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Subsequent to the formation of opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a dual-damascene opening will desirably be formed utilizing opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as a portion of the dual-damascene, or two-tiered opening. As such, photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is formed over the structure using conventional methods such as by coating. Photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is formed over top surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and fills opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be a commercially-available photoresist such as a DUV photoresist. In an exemplary embodiment, photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be a chemically amplified DUV photoresist that includes acid catalysts which render the photoresist material soluble in developer when exposed to ultra-violet light. Other photosensitive materials may be used in other exemplary embodiments. After photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> pattern may be formed within photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to create the dual-damascene structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> after a pattern has been formed using photomask <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Photomask <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> includes transmissive section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and opaque sections <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, chosen to be transmissive and opaque, respectively, to the light used to expose photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The light used for exposure is chosen in conjunction with photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, ultra-violet light may be used in conjunction with a DUV photoresist. When portions of photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are exposed by a DUV light source through the transmissive pattern formed in photomask <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the exposed portions of photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> desirably become fully soluble in developer. When a developer subsequently contacts photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the sections which have been exposed and are soluble in developer, are developed away and a pattern is formed in photosensitive material <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. A substantially identical pattern can then be formed in the underlying structure, such as in the exemplary film stack, using etching or other techniques. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows exposed section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Exposed section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is soluble in developer. Due to the oxygen-containing films <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the present invention, low-k dielectric films <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> do not include N&mdash;H base groups or other nitrogen-containing base groups such as amines or amino-silicates. If present, such base groups could pass through sidewalls <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, interact with the acid catalysts within photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and render insoluble portions of photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which are desired to be exposed and soluble in developer such as shown in the Prior Art structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Similarly, the presence of oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> prevents N&mdash;H base groups from diffusing from barrier layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> into photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. According to the present invention, exposed section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extends down to bottom <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and is substantially fully soluble in developer because the acid catalysts in photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> have not complexed with base groups that neutralize the acid catalysts and render them ineffective. The acid catalysts in exposed section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> therefore render exposed section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> soluble in developer after it has been exposed by ultra-violet light. After exposed section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has been treated with developer, and removed, an etching process may be used to form the exemplary dual-damascene structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an exemplary dual-damascene opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> formed after the photosensitive film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> was developed and portions of the underlying film stack were etched. Various suitable developing and etching process sequences may be used to form the exemplary structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In an exemplary embodiment, an intermediate etching step may be terminated when etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is exposed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> includes exemplary dual-damascene opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which is a two-tiered opening that includes top portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and bottom portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, bottom portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> includes width <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which is substantially the same as the width of opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from which dual damascene opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is formed. Alternatively stated, exemplary bottom portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is not significantly etched laterally during the etching process used to form dual-damascene opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> from the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Top portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> includes width <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which is greater than width <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Top portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> extends through hardmask layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, upper low-k dielectric film <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and terminates on exposed portions of oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Top portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> therefore includes a bottom defined by top surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of oxygen-containing film <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Bottom portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extends through oxygen-containing films <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, lower low-k dielectric film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and barrier layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Bottom portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> extends to bottom surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is intended to be exemplary only and other dual-damascene structures may be used alternatively. For example, the dual-damascene or two-tiered opening may include an upper portion having a relative width greater than illustrated, and more than one bottom portion which extends to bottom surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and a pillar or unetched section in the bottom portion separating two or more bottom portion openings. The dual damascene opening may subsequently be filled with a conductive material as an interconnect medium. In an exemplary embodiment, the interconnect medium formed within the dual damascene opening may serve as a via to connect a subjacent conductive feature to a superjacent conductive feature. For example, bottom surface <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be the top surface of a subjacent conductive line such as conductive line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for example. According to other exemplary embodiments, the interconnect medium may serve other functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A fundamental concept of the present invention is that any of various dual-damascene structures may be formed. More particularly, after an opening such as opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is formed to extend through a low-k dielectric film or a plurality of low-k dielectric films such as the two such films shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, chemically amplified DUV photoresists may be introduced to the arrangement to effectuate a subsequent pattern. An advantage of the present invention is that when such photosensitive material is introduced to the structure, amine or other N&mdash;H base groups do not become nested within the low-k dielectric films and therefore do not diffuse from the low-k dielectric films into the photosensitive film, rendering affected portions insoluble in developer. Pattern distortion is therefore alleviated and insoluble, difficult-to-remove photoresists do not result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The preceding merely illustrates the principles of the invention.
