<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a resin-sealed semiconductor device including half-etched leads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Recently, in order to deal with miniaturization of the electronic equipments, semiconductor components mounted on the electronic equipments need be mounted at a high density. In response to such a need, improvement in performance as well as reduction in size and thickness of the semiconductor components have been accelerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, in order to mount the semiconductor devices on a printed board surface at a high density, a semiconductor chip incorporating elements such as transistors is sealed in a square or rectangular sealing resin, thereby forming a resin-sealed semiconductor device. QFP (quad flat package) technology, i.e., technology of arranging a multiplicity of gull-wing-shaped external lead terminals on the side surfaces of the package, has been widely used for such a resin-sealed semiconductor device. The QFP technology is also required to increase the number of external lead terminals in order to deal with improved performance (improved LSI (Large Scale Integration)) of the semiconductor chip. In this case, in order to increase the number of external lead terminals without increasing the outside dimensions of a QFP, narrow-pitch QFPs having a terminal pitch of 0.3 mm are now partially used for practical applications. However, manufacturing and mounting of such a narrow-pitch QFP have not been successful due to the problems such as reduced yield and degraded quality resulting from bending of the leads. Moreover, the QFP technology is encountering many obstacles to reduction in size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, the following method was proposed in order to implement improvement in performance as well as reduction in size and thickness: the lower portion of each lead is partially removed by half etching. In the resin sealing step, a resin film is pressed against the lower surface of the whole lead frame so as to expose from the sealing resin the lower portion of each lead except for the half-etched portion. The exposed portion of each lead is used as an external terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the conventional resin-sealed semiconductor device including leads each having a half-etched portion, wire bonding of the leads is generally conducted by connecting a thin metal wire to each lead at a position right above an external terminal, that is, right above a non-half-etched portion, in order to effectively apply to the thin metal wire the pressing force required to connect the thin metal wire to the lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, recent improvement in performance and reduction in size of the semiconductor devices is making it difficult to conduct wire bonding while preventing the metal wires connected to the respective leads from contacting each other. More specifically, during wire bonding, the tip of a bonding tool moves to form a complicated locus. Therefore, a substantial space is required between the metal wires, and also crossing of the metal wires as viewed two-dimensionally must be prevented as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Arranging the external terminals exposed from the back surface of the sealing resin (i.e., the lower portions of the leads) in a plurality of lines so as to achieve a high mounting density of the external terminals noticeably causes the aforementioned problems. For example, such arrangement results in a very narrow space between the metal wires connected to the leads at a position right above the respective external terminals, or necessitates crossing of the thin metal wires. In particular, there may be a case where external terminals are to be provided also under the semiconductor chip. In such a case, the thin metal wires cannot be connected to the leads at a position right above the respective external terminals. Therefore, it is actually impossible to satisfy such a requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The steps prior to the resin sealing step may be conducted with a resin film attached in advance to a lead frame. In such a case, however, it is more difficult to apply to the half-etched portion of the lead the pressing force required to connect the thin metal wire to the lead. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to avoid the problems associated with wire bonding of a resin-sealed semiconductor device while allowing for increase in the number of external terminals each formed from a part of a corresponding lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A method for manufacturing a resin-sealed semiconductor device according to the present invention includes the steps of: (a) preparing a lead frame including a die pad on which a semiconductor chip is mounted, a frame arranged outside the die pad, and a plurality of leads extending from the frame toward the die pad and each including a half-etched portion; (b) mounting on the die pad of the lead frame the semiconductor chip including a plurality of electrode pads; (c) mounting the lead frame having the semiconductor chip mounted thereon on a jig including projections for supporting the half-etched portions of the leads to which thin metal wires are respectively connected out of the half-etched portions of the plurality of leads; (d) connecting the electrode pads of the semiconductor chip to the plurality of leads by the thin metal wires, respectively; and (e) resin-sealing the semiconductor chip, the die pad, the leads and the thin metal wires with a resin film being pressed against a lower surface of the lead frame. In the step (d), the half-etched portions to which the thin metal wires are connected are supported by the projections of the jig, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to this method, of the plurality of leads, each of the leads to which a thin metal wire is connected at the half-etched portion has a corresponding projection of the jig located under the half-etched portion when the thin metal wires are connected to the leads in the step (d). Accordingly, wire bonding can be reliably conducted with the pressing force effectively applied to the thin metal wire. Moreover, limitations on the position in each lead where the thin metal wire is connected are reduced, enabling the number of leads to be increased or the positions of the leads to be changed in various ways while avoiding the problems in the wire bonding. This allows for reduction in size of a resin-sealed semiconductor device with improved performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The step (d) may be conducted with the heated jig. This enables the thin metal wires to be easily connected to the leads in a reliable manner in the wire bonding step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The resin film may be mounted to the lower surface of the lead frame prior to the step (c), and the step (d) may be conducted with the resin film being mounted to the lower surface of the lead frame. This enables the resin sealing step to be conducted with a plurality of semiconductor chips mounted in a single die cavity of a sealing mold, allowing the mounting step using the resin film to be conducted with improved efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the step (d), the jig including a vacuuming opening may be used to draw the resin film toward a surface of the jig by vacuuming. This enables the problems due to slacking in the resin film to be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the step (d), the die pad of the lead frame may be raised upward. This enables wire bonding to be conducted with the resin film being stretched more reliably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A material having a thermal expansion coefficient of 5 to 25&times;10 ppm/&deg; C. may be used as the resin film. This enables slacking in the resin film to be suppressed within a proper range even when the resin film is heated by the jig in the step (d). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the step (a), an upper surface of the die pad of the lead frame may be located higher than respective upper surfaces of the leads. Preparing such a lead frame enables the leads to be extended to a position under the semiconductor chip, whereby the range in which the external terminals may be arranged can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the step (a), the plurality of leads of the lead frame may be arranged such that respective lower portions of the plurality of leads except for the half-etched portions are arranged in a plurality of lines when viewed from a back surface of the sealing resin. This enables mounting of a resin-sealed semiconductor device with improved performance.</paragraph>

The lower portion of each of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is partially removed by half etching. The residual portion that remains after half-etching the lower portion is herein referred to as half-etched portion Phe. The lower end face of the non-half-etched portion of each of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is exposed without being covered with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. These portions are first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The respective tips of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are located directly under the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In other words, the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> overlaps the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as viewed two-dimensionally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>arranged in two lines are exposed from the back surface of the resin-sealed semiconductor device without being covered with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so that the respective lower surfaces of the first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>serve as connection surfaces with a mounting board such as a printed circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the resin sealing step described below, resin is introduced into a die cavity with a resin film being attached to the lower surface of a lead frame. This prevents a resin bur resulting from excessive resin from being formed at the exposed portion of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the respective lower surfaces of the first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the resin sealing step, improving reliability of the connection between the external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and electrodes of the mounting board. Since a part of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is present under the respective half-etched portions Phe of the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are held with the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with improved holding power, resulting in improving reliability of the resin-sealed semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present embodiment, the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are connected to the respective half-etched portions Phe of the first signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As described below, the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are connected to the first signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while making sure that the pressing force applied between the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the first signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>works effectively. This allows for excellent reliability of the connection between the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present embodiment can be easily configured so as to avoid approach and crossing of the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when they are respectively connected to the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, thereby reducing the positional limitations on the external terminals. This enables increase in overall size of the package of the resin-sealed semiconductor device to be avoided even when a relatively large semiconductor chip with improved performance is mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In particular, in the present embodiment, the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extend to the position right under the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the first external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are arranged under the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This particularly enables a multiplicity of external terminals to be arranged within a small area even when a relatively large semiconductor chip with improved performance is mounted, whereby a resin-sealed semiconductor device can be provided which is suitable for increased density of the external terminals, and reduced size and thickness of the semiconductor device. Note that, even when the external terminals are arranged outside the semiconductor chip and the thin metal wires are connected to the signal connection leads at a position right above the respective external terminals, the signal connection leads are extended to the position under the semiconductor chip. This ensures that the sealing resin holds a large region of each signal connection lead, allowing for improved reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Note that, in the present embodiment, the first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged in two lines at the back surface of the resin-sealed semiconductor device. However, the external terminals may be arranged in three or more lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present embodiment, the first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are exposed from the back surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> need only be connected to the electrodes of the mounting substrate in order to mount the resin-sealed semiconductor device of the present embodiment on the mounting substrate. This allows the external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to be directly used as external electrodes, eliminating the need to additionally provide a solder ball on each of the external terminal portions <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for mounting on the mounting substrate. This is also advantageous in terms of man-hour and manufacturing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the manufacturing process of the resin-sealed semiconductor device in the present embodiment will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>E are cross-sectional views illustrating the manufacturing process of the resin-sealed semiconductor device according to the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the step of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is prepared, and a resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached to the back surface of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Although the structure of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is simplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> actually has a structure as described below. It should be noted that the step such as wire bonding may be conducted without attaching the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the lead frame in this stage, and the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be attached to a sealing mold in the resin sealing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> serves as a mask for preventing the sealing resin from reaching particularly the back surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (in the case where the die pad is exposed) and the back surface of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the resin sealing step, and also serves to fill the resin under the half-etched portions Phe. The presence of the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> enables a resin bur from being formed at the back surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (in the case where the die pad is exposed) and the back surface of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Moreover, in the resin sealing step, the sealing resin is introduced with the lower portion of each signal connection lead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>being pressed into the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the resin sealing is completed, the external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>project from the back surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by a prescribed height. In other words, a standoff as an external terminal is obtained, enabling the resin-sealed semiconductor device to be mounted on the mounting substrate without providing any solder ball as an external terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is desirably a film- or tape-like member that is based on a resin primarily containing polyethylene terephthalate, polyimide, polycarbonate or the like, and that has an adhesive applied thereon. The following resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is desirable: the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is capable of being separated from the lead frame after the resin sealing by reducing the adhesive strength by heat treatment, chemical processing or UV (ultraviolet) radiation, retains appropriate physical positions (pitch) of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, withstands appropriate deformation at a high temperature in the step of connecting the thin metal wires, is recoverable at normal temperature, and is resistant to high-temperature environment in the step of connecting the thin metal wires and the resin sealing step. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the term &ldquo;half-etched&rdquo; as used herein means that each signal connection lead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is partially etched away in the thickness direction, and does not mean that each signal connection lead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is etched away by half the thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not include any tie bar for preventing outflow of the sealing resin in the resin sealing step. The lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment is a lead frame plated with three metal layers. More specifically, the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a frame of a copper (Cu) material plated with a nickel (Ni) layer as underplating, a palladium (Pd) layer thereon, and a thin gold (Au) layer as the uppermost layer.

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Then, in the step of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> mounted thereon and the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> attached thereto is mounted in a sealing mold <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed from a lower mold <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and an upper mold <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> having a large die cavity <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. At this time, a plurality of semiconductor chips <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are accommodated in a single die cavity <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Resin sealing is conducted as follows: a sealing resin is introduced into the die cavity <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the sealing mold <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the outer frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> being pressed with the sealing mold <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, in the step of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> attached to the back surface of the die pads <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is subjected to heat treatment, chemical processing, UV radiation or the like in order to reduce the adhesive strength of the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is then peeled off. The sealed structure is thus formed in which the respective lower surfaces of the first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are exposed from the back surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> without being covered with the sealing resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Finally, the respective base ends of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connected to the outer frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are cut with a cutting blade such that the cutting plane is substantially flush with the side surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Note that, as a method for locating the upper surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> higher than the upper surfaces of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, each suspension lead <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> may have a bent portion formed by pressing or the like so as to locate the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> higher than other parts of the lead frame. As a result, a gap is formed between the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, whereby the sealing resin reaches the back surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the resin sealing step. In this case, this improves the holding power of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for holding the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, resulting in improved reliability. It should be noted that, in the case where the back surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is exposed from the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as in the present embodiment, this improves heat dissipation to the mounting substrate. </paragraph>

In order to connect the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, it is necessary to heat the respective joints and apply the pressing force of normally about 40 g to about 60 g to the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by the bonding tool <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Since the heating plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having the projections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is used in the present embodiment, the pressing force and the heat can be effectively applied to the joints while preventing deformation of the half-etched portions Phe even when the thin metal wires are connected to the half-etched portions Phe of the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Note that, in the present embodiment, the thin metal wires are connected to the second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a position right above the respective external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> does not have any projection for supporting the half-etched portions of the second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. It should be noted that, in the case where the thin metal wires are connected to the half-etched portions Phe of the second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, projections for supporting the half-etched portions of the second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided in the heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, all the electrode pads <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the semiconductor chip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The wire bonding step is thus completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In general, in order to connect the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, it is necessary to heat the respective joints and apply the pressing force to the thin metal wires <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by the bonding tool <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. When the thin metal wires are connected to the half-etched portions Phe of the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the half-etched portions Phe may possibly be deformed. Even if the deformation is within the range of elastic deformation, bending of the half-etched portions Phe would hinder the pressing force from being effectively applied to the joints, thereby possibly degrading reliability of the connections. In the present invention, however, when the thin metal wires are connected to the half-etched portions Phe of the signal connection leads (in the present embodiment, the first signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) in the wire bonding step, conducting the wire bonding by using the heat plate (jig) having the projections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> at positions corresponding to the half-etched portions Phe ensures reliability of the connection between the thin metal wires and the signal connection leads. Moreover, in the case where the wire bonding is conducted with the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> being attached to the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the heat of the heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be efficiently transmitted to the signal connection leads (the first signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) with the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> being stretched tight. This also ensures reliability of the connection by the wire bonding. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in this case, each projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> directly contact the half-etched portion Phe of the corresponding first signal connection lead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This enables the pressing force of the bonding tool <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to be applied to the thin metal wire <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> while preventing deformation of the half-etched portion Phe of the first signal connection lead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, ensuring reliability of the connection. Note that the wire bonding step is conducted with the outer frame of the lead frame being pressed by the jig. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Second Modification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating only the wire bonding step according to the second modification of the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the present modification, wire bonding is conducted using a heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having a vacuuming hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> near the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. At this time, the jig presses the outer frame of the lead frame, but not up to the upper portions of the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. However, the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> around the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is pulled downward by vacuuming, enabling slacking in the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be effectively eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Third Modification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating only the wire bonding step according to the third modification of the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> used in the present modification is tilted such that the upper surface of the region inside the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is located higher than that of the region outside the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by a height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the upper surface of the region under the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is located higher than that of the peripheral region by a height H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In other words, the upper surface of the region of the heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> under the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is located higher than that of the region outside the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by the height (H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). This height (H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&plus;H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is set so that the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> hardly slacks when stretched by thermal expansion. At this time, the outer frame of the lead frame is pressed by the jig. Thus stretching the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the minimum required degree enables the relative positions (pitch) of the external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>after resin sealing to be stably made within the design range while suppressing slacking in the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating only the wire bonding step according to the fourth modification of the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In the present modification, wire bonding is conducted using a heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which includes, in addition to the structure of the third modification, a vacuuming hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> near the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a vacuuming hole <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> near the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> around the projections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is pulled downward, enabling slacking in the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be effectively eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Fifth Modification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating only the wire bonding step according to the fifth modification of the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> used in the present modification has a projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> under the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in addition to the projections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, so that the upper surface of the region under the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is located higher than the upper surfaces of the other regions. It should be noted that the heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the present modification is not tilted such that the upper surface of the region inside the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is located higher than that of the region outside the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by the height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as in the third modification. The outer frame of the lead frame is pressed by the jig. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the present modification as well, the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is raised upward by the projections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, enabling slacking in the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be effectively eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Sixth Modification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating only the wire bonding step according to the sixth modification of the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the present modification, wire bonding is conducted using a heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that includes, in addition to the structure of the fifth modification, a vacuuming hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> near the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a vacuuming hole <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> near the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The outer frame of the lead frame is pressed by the jig. The resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> around the projections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is pulled downward by vacuuming, enabling slacking in the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be effectively eliminated and also suppressing separation of the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from the heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that would otherwise occur as the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are pulled by the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Seventh Modification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view illustrating only the wire bonding step according to the seventh modification of the embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> used in the present modification includes, in addition to the projections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a tall projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> under the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so that the upper surface of the region under the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is located much higher than the upper surfaces of the other regions. The protruding amount of the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is set so that the suspension leads <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> are plastically deformed to locate the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> higher than other parts of the lead frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the third to sixth modifications, the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> raises the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> high during the wire bonding. After the wire bonding, however, the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> springs back so that the lower surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is substantially flush with the lower surface of each signal connection lead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In other words, in the third to sixth modifications, the height of the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is set so that the suspension leads <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> are only elastically deformed without being plastically deformed in the wire bonding step. At this time, the outer frame of the lead frame is pressed by the jig. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a vacuuming hole <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> near the projection <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a vacuuming hole <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> near the projection <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the present modification, the lower surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is separated from the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the resin sealing step after the wire bonding. As a result, the sealing resin reaches the lower surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the resin sealing step. This improves the holding power of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for holding the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and also enables introduction of moisture and the like through the interface between the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be suppressed. In other words, in the case where the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to be located higher than the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the present modification enables operations such as pressing the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in advance to be omitted, allowing for reduced manufacturing costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Moreover, according to the present modification, the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> around the projections <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is pulled downward, enabling slacking in the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be effectively eliminated and also suppressing separation of the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from the heat plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that would otherwise occur as the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are pulled by the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Eighth Modification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a bottom view of a resin-sealed semiconductor device according to the eighth modification regarding a method for arranging the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, in this example, the external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is approximately square in transverse section. The outer side surface of each first external terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is approximately flush with the side surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are arranged in line at a predetermined distance inward from the side surface of the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> According to the present modification, the external terminals are arranged as outside as possible, allowing for reduction in package size while increasing the number of external terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As has been described above, the embodiment of the present invention and the modifications thereof enable the thin metal wires to be connected to the half-etched portions Phe. This allows for stable production of a resin-sealed semiconductor device with reduced size and thickness and improved performance, making it possible to deal with various semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the step of attaching the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the lead frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used in common regardless of the size of the semiconductor device, the number of lands, and the pitch, thereby improving the productivity. This enables connection of the thin metal wires in a semiconductor device incorporating a die pad therein and having a small distance (pitch) between the external terminals, or a semiconductor device having an exposed die pad and having a small distance (pitch) between the external terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the manufacturing method of the present embodiment, a plurality of semiconductor chips are mounted in a large die cavity, and after sealing, the resultant structure is cut into resin-sealed semiconductor devices each incorporating a single semiconductor chip. This enables improvement in productivity and also enables the use of a common mold sized for the resin-sealed semiconductor devices. Moreover, the resin film <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached in advance to the lower surface of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the back surfaces of the first and second signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(the first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and the like prior to the resin sealing step. As a result, the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will not reach these surfaces in the sealing step, preventing a resin bur from being formed at the back surfaces of the die pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the first and second external terminals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the use of a method for resin-sealing a multiplicity of semiconductor chips in a common die cavity eliminates the need for the step of cutting with a mold after the resin sealing step. Accordingly, the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will not be separated due to the cutting stresses applied to the interface between the sealing resin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Further, the following problems can be prevented: reduction in yield in the cutting step due to falling of a resin bur produced at each cutting plane of the signal connection leads <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>; poor contact in the inspection step; poor connection due to falling of a resin bur during mounting; and generation of defects resulting from wear of the cutting mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Note that the present invention is not limited to the method of the above embodiment. For example, various combinations of the modifications of the present embodiment allow for reliable selection of both the number of external terminals arranged in a matrix and the arrangement thereof in a semiconductor device, which are suitable for the size of a semiconductor chip and the number of pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also applicable to a die pad portion of a semiconductor device of SON (small outline non-leaded package) and QFP incorporating a die pad therein. In this case, connection between the semiconductor chip and the thin metal wires is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Moreover, although increasing the costs, solder balls may be provided in order to manufacture a narrower-pitch semiconductor device and to mount such a semiconductor device on a printed board. </paragraph>
