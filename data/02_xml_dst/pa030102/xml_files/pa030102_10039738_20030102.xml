<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains generally to systems and apparatuses for testing integrated circuits (ICs), and more particularly to a test system having a pattern generator with a pattern memory and pattern scrambler for efficient high speed testing of ICs having logic circuits, memory arrays or both, and a method for using the same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Automated or automatic test systems are widely used by manufacturers in the electronic industry to test various devices, including electronic components and integrated circuits (ICs), to cull defective devices before they are incorporated in products. Broadly, there are three types of digital devices that are commonly tested using automated test systems, those having memory arrays or circuits, such as flash memory or random access memories (RAM), those having logic circuits, such as processors, application specific ICs (ASICs) and programmable logic devices (PLDs), and those having both memory circuits and logic circuits. Generally, it is desirable to test the devices at several points during the manufacturing process, including while they are still part of a wafer or substrate, after dicing but before they are packaged, and after packaging the devices but before they are mounted or assembled on modules, cards or boards. This repetitive testing imposes demands on automated test systems to perform tests at high speed and with a high degree of accuracy. Moreover, the trend in the electronics industry has been to further increase the miniaturization of electronic devices and circuits, thereby allowing for an increase in the complexity of the devices. As the devices become more complex, the complexity of the test systems and their cost increase correspondingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary part of a conventional test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for testing a device, commonly known as a Device Under Test or DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, having a number of pins <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> typically includes a general purpose computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or personal computer (PC), a clock <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a memory and sequencer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a pattern memory and sequencing circuit, a number of timing and format circuits (T/Fs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), and a number of pin electronics or PE channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Generally, the test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes one T/F <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an associated P/E channel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for each pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, shown here as having pins <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through n. The computer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> loads test signals or patterns, commonly known as test vectors, into the memory and sequencer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and controls operation of other components of the test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The clock <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a clock cycle and generates system clocks or clock signals and the test system period, both of which are provided to the memory and sequencer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the T/Fs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and other pipeline circuits in the test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The memory and sequencer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores and sequences test vectors used during the testing process. Commonly, the memory of the memory and sequencer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is either logic vector memory (LVM) which stores logic vectors, scan memory, which store scan vectors, or both. The T/Fs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adjust the timing and formatting of various signals of the test vectors, i.e., data, strobe and input/output (I/O) control signals, received from the memory and sequencer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and couple the output from the memory and sequencer to the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, through PE channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Each PE channel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> typically includes a PE driver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for applying a test vector or data, to a pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a comparator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for comparing a signal output from the DUT with an expected output signal, and an error logic circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for coupling results of the comparison back to error processing circuitry and an error capture memory (not shown). Generally, the PE driver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the comparator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are not active in the same PE channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the same time, since pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is either receiving data or control signals or transmitting a result at a given time. The PE channels <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> further include a data line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for coupling the test vectors from the T/F <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the PE driver <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and to the error logic <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, an enable or control line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for enabling the PE driver to apply the test vector to the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a strobe line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for enabling the error logic <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A fundamental problem with the above test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is that LVM and scan memory are typically expensive resources in automatic test systems. Moreover, conventional test systems typically only have a limited depth or amount of LVM available on each PE channel or pin on the DUT and, if available, a fixed width scan memory also having a limited depth dedicated to a fixed number of the PE channels or pins. The depth of these memories is important because as DUTs grow in density they require more and larger test vectors using more pattern memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another problem with the above test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, related to the above problem, is its inability to vary the widths and depths of the LVM and scan memories without extensive re-wiring of the hardwiring of connection between the memory and sequencer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the PE channels. Furthermore, this inability to vary the widths and depths of the LVM and scan memories results in inefficiency in the utilization of test system resources. That is, conventional test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> cannot vary the ratio of width to depth, the aspect ratio, of available pattern memory. For example, in a test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> designed to accommodate 64 pin devices, LVM outputs maybe mapped to 32 of the available PE channels to accommodate a 32-bit wide test vector. However, the depth or size of the test vector will be limited by the depth or size of the LVM. Moreover, even if the test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to test a device having fewer than 64 pins and requiring only 16-bit wide test vectors, the unused portion of the LVM corresponding to the unused LVM outputs cannot be used to increase the memory available for the 16-bit wide test vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Yet another problem with the test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above, is the inability to route any output from the memory and sequencer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to any PE channel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and therefore to any pin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, limiting the flexibility and pattern memory depth when parallel testing multiple DUTs on a test site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Still another problem with the conventional test system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above is its inability to clock or change the test pattern applied to a DUT <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a rate greater than once in a clock-cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a test system and method of using the same that increases the efficiency and utilization of test system resources by maximizing the available storage space in pattern memory for a test vector of a given width. There is a further need for a system and method that enables the aspect ratio of available pattern memory to be tailored based on a width of required test vectors. There is yet a further need for a system and method capable of routing any output from the pattern memory to any PE channel. There is a still further need for a system and method capable of changing the test vector applied from any output from the pattern memory to any PE channel at a rate greater than once in a clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The system and method of the present invention provides these and other advantages over the prior art. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a test system having logic vector memory (LVM) and scan memory with fully programmable widths and depths, and a method for using the same to increase utilization of test system resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention is directed to a pattern generator for testing a device under test (DUT). Generally, the pattern generator comprises: (i) a pattern memory for storing a number of bits for testing the DUT, the pattern memory having a number of outputs for outputting the bits to test the DUT; and (ii) a pattern scrambler coupled between the outputs and a number of pins on the DUT, the pattern scrambler capable of being programmed to couple bits from one or more of the outputs to one or more of the pins on the DUT, to provide a test pattern to the DUT having a width of from 1 bit wide to a width equal to the number of outputs or the pins on the DUT. Preferably, the pattern memory has n outputs and a capacity of m&times;n bits, and the pattern scrambler is capable of being programmed to provide test patterns having depths of from n&times;m bits with a width of 1 bit to depths of m bits with a width of n bits. More preferably, the pattern generator is part of a test system further comprising a clock having a clock cycle, and the pattern scrambler is able to change the width, the depth, or both of test patterns provided to the DUT on a cycle-by-cycle basis for each clock cycle of the test system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the pattern scrambler is capable of coupling bits from any one of the outputs to any one of the pins on the DUT. In one version of this embodiment, the pattern generator is part of a test system having a clock with a clock cycle, the pattern scrambler is capable of changing bits coupled to one or more of the pins on the DUT on a cycle-by-cycle basis for each clock cycle of the test system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the pattern memory is capable of being operated, partitioned or divided to simultaneously provide a logic vector memory (LVM) and a scan memory for storing, respectively, logic vectors and scan vectors each including a number of bits and having a width and a depth. Preferably, the logic vectors stored in the LVM and the scan vectors stored in the scan memory need not have the same width and/or depth. Typically, the logic vectors stored in LVM are wide, often equal to the number of pins on the DUT. Scan memory is usually narrower, often only as wide as a few pins. More preferably, pattern generator is part of a test system having a clock with a clock cycle, and the width and/or depth of the logic vector and the scan vector can be changed &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; on a cycle-by-cycle basis as noted above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the pattern generator is part of a test system having a clock with a clock cycle, and the pattern scrambler is capable of switching or changing any one of the outputs, and the bits output therefrom, coupled to any one of the pins on the DUT at least twice in each clock cycle to provide test patterns to the DUT at a rate at least twice that of the clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method for testing a device under test (DUT) using a test system having a pattern memory with a number of outputs for outputting a number of bits to test the DUT, and a pattern scrambler coupled between the outputs and a number of pins on the DUT. In the method, bits for testing the DUT are stored in the pattern memory, and the pattern scrambler programmed or operated to couple bits from one or more of the outputs to one or more of the pins on the DUT, thereby providing a test pattern to the DUT. Generally, the test pattern can have a width of from 1 bit to a width equal to the number of the outputs or the pins on the DUT. Preferably, the pattern memory has n outputs and a capacity of m&times;n bits, and the step of programming the pattern scrambler involves programming the pattern scrambler to provide test patterns having a depth of from n&times;m bits with a width of 1 bit to a depth of m bits with a width of n bits. More preferably, the test system further includes a clock having a clock cycle, and the step of programming the pattern scrambler encompasses programming the pattern scrambler to change at least one of the width or the depth of the test patterns provided to the DUT on a cycle-by-cycle basis for each clock cycle of the test system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, in which the test system further includes a clock having a clock cycle, and in which the pattern scrambler is capable of coupling bits from any one of the outputs to any one of the pins on the DUT, the step of programming the pattern scrambler involves programming the pattern scrambler to switch or change bits coupled to one or more of the plurality of pins on the DUT on a cycle-by-cycle basis for each clock cycle of the test system. Optionally, the pattern scrambler can be programmed to switch bits from any one of the outputs coupled to any one of the pins on the DUT at least twice in each clock cycle, thereby providing test patterns to the DUT at a rate at least twice that of the clock cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the pattern memory is capable of being operated, divided or partitioned to simultaneously provide a logic vector memory (LVM) and a scan memory. In this embodiment, the step of storing a number of bits in the pattern memory for testing the DUT involves storing in the LVM logic vectors with a number of bits and having a width and a depth, and storing in the scan memory scan vectors with a number of bits and having a width and a depth In one version of this embodiment, the logic vectors stored in the LVM and the scan vectors stored in the scan memory need not have the same width and/or depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the pattern scrambler has the ability to split the three bits delivered per DUT pin to two or more different pins, allowing one DUT pin or pins to act in the drive mode and the other DUT pin or pins to act in the receive mode, as is common in scan testing where pins are typically dedicated as scan-in pins or scan-out pins and do not change input/output (I/O) state on a cycle-by-cycle basis. In this mode of operation, the Strobe Control bit function is unchanged, but the I/O Control bit changes function and is used as an Expect Data bit for the error logic. Using this scheme maximizes the usage of the LVM and scan memory, especially when scan-in DUT pins are equal in number to scan-out DUT pins, which is the typical case.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Generally, test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> includes, in addition to test site computer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, a clock <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, a test signal source or pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a number of pin electronic (PE) circuits or channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and a number of timing generators and format circuits (T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) coupled between the pattern generator and the PE channels. The test site computer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is a special purpose computer that couples to every other component or element in test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for controlling the operation thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Clock <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> provides a timing or clock signal having a clock cycle to pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Generally, each PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> receives a 3-bit portion of the test pattern or signal from the pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> through the T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, each 3-bit signal including a drive/expect data signal, a strobe control signal and an Input/Output (I/O) control signal. Some test systems decode these (typically) three bits into a different combination of eight PE control functions. Each PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> typically includes a PE driver <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> coupleable or capable of coupling signals to a pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a comparator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> for comparing an output signal with an expected output signal, and an error logic circuit <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> for coupling results of the comparison back through the pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to an error capture memory (not shown) in the test site computer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. Generally, PE driver <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and comparator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are not active in the same PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> at the same time, since pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is either receiving data or control signals or transmitting a result at a given time. PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> further include a data line <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for coupling the drive/expect data signal from T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to PE driver <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and error logic <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, an enable or control line <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> for coupling the I/O control signal from T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the PE driver enabling it to apply the drive/expect data signal to a pin <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> of the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a strobe line <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> for coupling the strobe control signal to the error logic <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> to enable it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes a pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and a pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> coupled between the pattern memory and the T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> has memory for storing test patterns or vectors having a number of bits and a number of pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> for transmitting, coupling or outputting the test patterns to the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is connected to the pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> and has pattern scrambler outputs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> connected to the T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to transmit or couple bits from one or more of the pattern memory outputs to one or more of the pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, to provide a test pattern or test vector to the DUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is capable of coupling bits from any one of the pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> to any one or more PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> through the T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Thus, the pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the present invention is able to provide a test pattern having a width of from 1 bit wide to a width equal to the number of the pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> or the number of PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, whichever is less. The test pattern has a corresponding depth or size depending on the capacity of the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. For example, if the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is a memory array having n pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> and a capacity of m&times;n bits, the pattern scrambler can be programmed to provide test patterns having depths of from n&times;m bits with a width of 1 bit to depths of m bits with a width of n bits. Preferably, the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is able to change the width, the depth, or both of test patterns provided to the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; or on a cycle-by-cycle basis for each clock cycle of the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. More preferably, the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is also capable of changing bits coupled to one or more of the pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on a cycle-by-cycle basis without rewiring of the test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the connection to the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or extensive reprogramming of pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Components or elements of the pattern generator <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> will now be described in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a partial block diagram of the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> showing details of the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and a portion of the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> for a single PE channel according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> includes drive/expect data pattern memory <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, strobe control pattern memory <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and I/O control pattern memory <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, for providing drive/expect data signals, strobe control signals, and I/O control signals, respectively, to the pattern scrambler via pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. The pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> includes three switching elements or circuits, such as multiplexers, crossbar switches or switching fabric, for each PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> in the test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and is capable of connecting any one of a predetermined number of pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> to a predetermined number of PE channels through an associated T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. For example, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> includes three 64-to-1 multiplexers for each one of 64 PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, including a drive/expect data multiplexer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a strobe control multiplexer <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and an I/O control multiplexer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Thus, the multiplexers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, associated with any given PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> are capable of selecting from the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> a 3-bit signal including a drive/expect data bit from any of 64 pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, a strobe control bit from any of 64 pattern memory outputs, and an I/O control bit from any of 64 pattern memory outputs. A scramble set select <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> controls which outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> couples to a particular PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> or T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In the example shown, the scramble set select <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> includes six lines connected in parallel to each of the multiplexers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, to select any of the 64, or 2<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>, pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the pattern memory <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is a logic vector memory (LVM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) adapted to store logic vectors for testing logic circuits in the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and includes drive/expect data LVM <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>, strobe control LVM <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and I/O control LVM <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. The pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is an LVM or vector scrambler <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> including multiple switching elements or circuits, such as multiplexers, crossbar switches or switching fabric, for each PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> in the test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and is capable of connecting any one of a predetermined number of LVM outputs <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> to a predetermined number of PE channels through their associated T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. An LVM scramble set select <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> controls which of the LVM outputs <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> the LVM scrambler <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> couples to a particular PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> or T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the pattern memory <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is a scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> adapted to store scan vectors for serial type test interfaces or for structural test of the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and includes drive/expect data scan memory <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, strobe control scan memory <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight>, and I/O control scan memory <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. The pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is a scan scrambler <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> including multiple switching elements or circuits, such as multiplexers, crossbar switches or switching fabric, for each PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> in the test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and is capable of connecting any one of a predetermined number of scan outputs <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to a predetermined number of PE channels through their associated T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. A scan scramble set select <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> controls which scan outputs <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> the scan scrambler <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> couples to a particular PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> or T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, not shown, the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is capable of being operated, partitioned or divided to simultaneously provide LVM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and a scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> for storing logic vectors and scan vectors respectively. Each vector includes a number of bits and has a width and a depth. The logic vectors stored in the LVM potion of the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and the scan vectors stored in the scan memory portion need not have the same width and/or depth Generally, logic vectors are wide, often equal to the number of pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or to the number of pins adapted to receiving parallel logic vector inputs. Scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> and the scan vectors stored therein are usually narrower, often only as wide as a few pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. In one version of this embodiment, the width and/or depth of the logic and scan vectors, and therefore the LVM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>, can be changed &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; on a cycle-by-cycle basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, scan vectors are stored with logic vectors in the same pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. In this case, the logic vectors and scan vectors are sent to the T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through a single pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> can map the logic vectors and scan vectors having different widths if required to different pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> or PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> if required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Additional alternative embodiments of a test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> according to the present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a partial block diagram of a test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> having a pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, a pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, a T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and a PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> with double data rate (DDR) pattern scrambling according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> includes multiple switching elements or circuits, such as multiplexers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, as described above, for each PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> in the test site <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. However, unlike the embodiments described above, the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is adapted to couple two 3-bit signals from among the plurality of pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> to the T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of any particular PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The two 3-bit signals including two drive/expect data bits, two strobe control bits, and two I/O control bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In addition, T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> also receives a clock signal <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and a timing set select signal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The timing set select signal <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> enables the T/F to determine which of the two 3-bit signals, a primary bit or a DDR bit, to couple to the PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> during a particular portion of the clock cycle. The clock signal <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> enables the T/F to determine how long to couple the primary bit or the DDR bit to PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the length or duration with which each 3-bit signal is applied to the PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> need not be equal, nor do the times of the transitions or switching of pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> need necessarily to correspond. Typically, the clock signal <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> includes a number of regular clock ticks or pulses and, in conjunction with the timing set select signal <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, inform the T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> how pulses constitute a tester cycle. For example, the clock signal <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> can include pulses at a frequency of 100 MHz and the T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be programmed or operated to count 100 pulses to provide a 1 microsecond tester cycle. Thus, the T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can switch the 3-bit signal coupled to associated PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> from 2 to many times a tester cycle, provided that sufficient bits are coupled to the T/F by pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, and that timing set select signal <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> includes sufficient information to enable the T/F to determine which 3-bit signal to couple to the PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> during a particular portion of the clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An embodiment or a process or method for testing the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at a frequency greater than that of the clock <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a timing diagram illustrating double data rate pattern scrambling according to an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, for a test system operating at a single data rate, shown by graph <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> in the top of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is seen that a 3-bit test signal, DATA A is applied to a particular PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> at T<highlight><subscript>zero </subscript></highlight>of clock cycle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and continues to be applied uninterrupted for the entire clock cycle. At or near T<highlight><subscript>zero </subscript></highlight>of the clock cycle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> another 3-bit test signal, DATA B, is applied uninterrupted for the entire clock cycle. Although, in this embodiment the 3-bit signal can be applied starting at different times during the clock cycle, including times interpolated between clock pulses or cycles, only one 3-bit signal can be coupled to a PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> during a clock cycle. In contrast, for the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> two 3-bit signals can be applied to a PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> during a clock cycle, as shown in graph <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> in the lower half of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Referring to graph <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, it is seen that a first 3-bit signal, DATA A, can be coupled to a PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> at T<highlight><subscript>zero </subscript></highlight>of clock cycle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a second 3-bit signal, DATA B, can be coupled to the pin at a later time, T<highlight><subscript>zero&plus;n </subscript></highlight>as shown. It should be noted that the duration or length of time in a clock cycle during which each 3-bit signal is coupled to the PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> need not be equal and the first 3-bit signal can be applied at locations other than T<highlight><subscript>zero</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>

In the embodiment shown, the pin scrambler includes three multiplexers <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, for coupling a three bit signal, including a data bit, a strobe control bit, and an I/O control bit, from the LVM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> or APG, to an associated PE channel through its&apos; T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Generally, all outputs <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> of the APG <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> are coupled to the pin scrambler <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight>, while only a single 3-bit signal is coupled to the pin scrambler from the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> (not shown) , or one 3-bit signal each from the LVM scrambler <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and scan scrambler <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>, as shown. The pin scrambler further receives a pin scramble set select (not shown) similar to the scramble set select, LVM scramble set select, and scan scramble set select described above to control which 3-bit signal the pin scrambler <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> couples to a particular T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> or PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is partitioned or divided to provide an LVM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>, and the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is logically divided to provide LVM scrambler <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and scan scrambler <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>, as described above.

The LVM scrambler <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and scan scrambler <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> include multiple, preferably three, switching circuits or elements for each PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. Generally, the LVM and scan scramblers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>, include one multiplexer dedicated to drive/expect data, one to strobe control, and one to I/O control, as shown. The LVM and scan scramblers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>, are each adapted to couple any of a number of 3-bit signals from the outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> from LVM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>, respectively, to the pin scrambler <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In another alternative embodiment, the LVM scrambler <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, scan scrambler <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> and pin scrambler <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> are adapted to enable the pin scrambler to couple two 3-bit signals to the T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for each PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. The T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> further receive a timing set select (not shown) that enables it to determine which of the two 3-bit signals, a primary bit or a DDR bit, to couple to the PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> during a particular portion of the clock cycle. Preferably, the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is programmed and the T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> operated to switch 3-bit signals coupled from the pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> to any given PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> at least twice in each clock cycle, thereby providing test patterns to the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at a rate at least twice that of the clock cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can further include a pin scrambler <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> between the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the T/Fs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and the scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> can be used to store logic vectors to provide a DDR vector memory. Logic vectors from the LVM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are selected or coupled to the PE channel <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> in a first part of the clock cycle using the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, and logic vectors from the scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> are selected in the second part of the clock cycle. This yields DDR logic vectors using two single speed scramblers, i.e., the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> composed of single data rate scramblers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A method or process for testing a DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> using a test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> with a number of outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> for outputting a number of bits to test the DUT, and a pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> coupled between the outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> and a number of pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on the DUT will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a process for operating the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the process begins by storing a test pattern or vector comprising a number of bits for testing the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>). Generally, this is accomplished by loading a test pattern from the test site computer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> via a computer bus (not shown). Next, the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is programmed or operated to couple bits from one or more of the outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> of the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> to one or more of the pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, thereby providing a test pattern to the DUT (step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>). The test pattern can have a width of from 1 bit to a width equal to the number of the pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, PE channels <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> or the pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a depth of from n&times;m bits, where the capacity of the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is n&times;m bits, to m bits. Finally, an output or signal from the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> generated in response to the test vector is coupled back through the comparator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and error logic circuit <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> to error processing circuitry (step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). Optionally, results are logged in an error capture memory (step <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>). The pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> may also be re-programmed to change at least one of the width or the depth of the test patterns provided to the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a cycle-by-cycle basis for each subsequent clock cycle of the apparatus (step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the pattern memory <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> is capable of being operated, divided or partitioned to simultaneously provide LVM <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and scan memory <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight>, and the step of storing bits in the pattern memory, <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, involves storing in the LVM logic vectors, and storing in the scan memory scan vectors. As noted above, the logic vectors and the scan vectors need not have the same width and/or depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the process further involves the step of programming the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> to change at least one of the width or the depth of the test patterns provided to the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a cycle-by-cycle basis for each clock cycle of the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the process further involves the step of programming the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> to provide two 3-bit signals or two bits, including a primary bit and a DDR bit to each T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and operating the T/F to switch or change signals or bits coupled to one or more of the pins on the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on a cycle-by-cycle basis for each clock cycle of the test system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>). In one version of this embodiment, the step of programming or operating the pattern scrambler <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, involves programming the pattern scrambler and operating the T/F <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to switch bits coupled from any one or more of the pattern memory outputs <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> to any one of the pins <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> on the DUT <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at least twice in each clock cycle, thereby providing test patterns to the DUT at a rate at least twice that of the clock cycle. </paragraph>
