<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a product containing hydrolyzed whole eggs wherein the eggs are utilized as a carrier of the active ingredients in the product and is used to achieve the desired effects of the product. More specifically, the present invention relates to a hydrolyzed whole egg product for use as a cosmetic, pharmaceutical and/or medicinal product applicable for soothing sore muscles, expediting the healing and repairing process of the skin and reducing the visual appearance of cellulite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are numerous cosmetic and skin care products that use components of eggs as major ingredients in their formulation. For example, some cosmetic or skin care products use egg whites in their formulation. Other cosmetic and skin care products use extracts of yokes in their formulation. The use of whole egg has never been achieved since the mixing and/or shearing process of the manufacturing of the product will cause the egg components to coagulate and form mayonnaise. There have also been problems with incorporating the whole egg in the formations since the shearing and heating process of most processes have denatured the proteins in the eggs and have inactivated the active ingredients in the egg which provides for its excellent carrier/delivery properties. In addition, there are no cosmetic, medicinal, pharmaceutical and/or cosmopharmaceutical product that utilize whole eggs as carriers for their active ingredients. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Below is a manufacturing process that is suitable for all three products which depicts a unique method of the addition of the water-soluble egg into the oil phase of the formulation at relatively high temperatures. The process allows the egg to encapsulate the oils and permits the formulation containing the encapsulated egg to penetrate into the skin and deliver the active ingredients. The egg with the encapsulated oils is termed &ldquo;Eggosomes&rdquo; and is formed prior to the emulsification process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing process of the present invention is applicable to Examples 1-3 of the present invention and relates to the ingredients and sequence of additions illustrated in Tables 1-3. The manufacturing procedure is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Into a stainless steel, jacketed kettle equipped with at least one high shear mixer and at least one planetary mixer, Sequence &num;1 is loaded under adequate shear and heated from about 76 degrees Celsius to about 78 degrees Celsius. (For purposes of this invention, adequate shear is defined as from about 800 to about 2000 RPMs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> After adequate shearing and heating of Sequence &num;1, Sequence &num;2 is then loaded to the kettle and is further heated from about 82 degrees Celsius to about 86 degrees Celsius, with adequate shear. (For purposes of this invention, adequate shear is defined as from about 800 to about 2000 RPMs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the kettle reaches its optimum temperatures, the hydrolyzed whole egg is added to the oil phase kettle and the heating is stopped. The hydrolyzed egg is gently stirred into the oil, and is evenly coated with the oil, but not burned (this is known as the formation of the &ldquo;Eggosome&rdquo;). Within seconds, the oil phase is added to the water phase, thus completing the &ldquo;Eggosome&rdquo; or carrier vehicle. The emulsion is formed. The temperature and energy are carefully monitored to ensure that a small particle is formed (this can be confirmed under the microscope). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Once the emulsion is formed, the cooling process begins and the process may then be continued until the phases of the formula are further added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;Eggosome&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ovasome&rdquo; of the present invention is capable of carrying and delivering any and all types of ingredients, active and inactive, natural and synthetic, drugs, nutrients, or bioactives. The formulation of the present invention can also be modified to function as a cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical formulation depending on the additional ingredients added to this unique manufacturing process and depending on what ingredients may be desired to be delivered to a human or animal target. In one embodiment, the formulation of the present invention may be simply applied to the skin and the semi-permeable nature of the skin will allow entrance of the formulation and the &ldquo;Eggosome&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ovasome&rdquo; will then be able to deliver the desired material to the desired target. Since the &ldquo;Eggosome&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ovasome&rdquo; is capable of carrying various ingredients including active drugs, the formulation of the present invention may also have medicinal applications. The present invention may also include accelerated healing ingredients that may be applied to adhesive patches and bandages for commercial and hospital use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the attendant claims attached hereto, this invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically disclosed herein. </paragraph>
