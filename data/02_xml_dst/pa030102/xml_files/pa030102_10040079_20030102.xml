<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a balance-to-unbalance transformer (balun) used in a wireless local network or personal communication, and more specifically to a multi-layer radio frequency chip balun that can be fabricated as a device in a microchip. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A balun is a device for converting signals between an unbalanced circuit structure and a balanced circuit structure. The signal of a balanced circuit structure comprises two signal components with same amplitude but 180-degree phase difference. Many analog circuits require balanced inputs and outputs in order to reduce noise and high order harmonics as well as improve the dynamic range of the circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There are several types of baluns that are either active or passive. Passive baluns can be classified as lumped-type, coil-type and distributed-type baluns. A lumped-type balun uses lumped capacitors and inductors to match impedance and generate two balanced signals with same amplitude but 180-degree phase difference. The advantages of a lumped-type balun are small volume and lightweight. However, it is not easy to maintain the 180-degree phase difference and the identical amplitude between the two signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Coil-type baluns have been widely used in lower frequency and ultra high frequency (UHF) bands. When a coil-type balun is used in higher than the UHF band, it usually has a drawback of having considerable loss. In addition, it has reached the limit of miniaturization and can not be further reduced in size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Distributed-type baluns can further be classified as 180-degree hybrid and Marchand. A 180-degree hybrid balun has a fairly good frequency response in the microwave frequency band. However, its size often poses a problem when it is used in the radio frequency range between 200 MHz and several GHz. Because a 180-degree hybrid balun comprises a few sections of quarter wave transmission lines, it is difficult to reduce the size. Even if it is manufactured in a meandered way, a significant area is still required. One approach to reducing the size is to use a power divider along with a pair of transmission lines having different length for generating the 180-degree phase difference. Nevertheless, the size is still too large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> Marchand balun commonly used in the industry comprises two sections of quarter wave coupled lines. This type of baluns has a fairly large bandwidth. Both phase balance and power distribution of a Marchand balun are reasonably good. However, the transmission lines in a Marchand balun need to be tightly coupled in order to achieve a sufficient bandwidth. Therefore, a Marchand balun is often broadside coupled to reduce its area. It is also fabricated in a meandered way to minimize its size. The balun is commonly seen in an RF application. Using a high dielectric constant material can also reduce the size of a Marchand balun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,497,137 discloses a chip-type transformer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention has been made to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks of conventional baluns. The primary object is to provide a multi-layer radio frequency chip balun. The multi-layer radio frequency chip balun comprises a multi-layer dielectric structure. The equivalent circuit of the multi-layer dielectric structure comprises mainly an input port, a first and a second output ports, and a few even sections of broadside coupled lines. Each section of the coupled line is wired in a particular shape and is composed of two coupled lines. Each section of coupled lines corresponds to a coupled coefficient. The sections of the coupled lines have completely symmetric structures on two sides with respect to the center geometrically. Both phase and amplitude are well balanced at the balanced ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, the multi-layer radio frequency chip balun uses the ratio of coefficients of the coupled transmission lines to properly match the impedance at the balanced output ports. For example, by changing the line widths of the coupled transmission lines or the thickness of the layer, the impedance can be changed and the dimensions of the system can be reduced. Therefore, the overall dimension of the system designed by this invention is much smaller than that by Marchand balun. Moreover, the balance of phase and amplitude can be adjusted by inserting a trimming section of transmission lines between two coupled lines and can get a more complicated impedance match when the impedance values at the input and output ports are complex numbers. In addition, the balun of the invention can be realized with low dielectric constant materials to increase its stability. Therefore, the balun can be fabricated with a microchip size and suitably used in a wireless network or personal communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiments of this invention, multiple sections of coupled lines can be incorporated. The coupled lines are manufactured with winding lines such as spiral lines, meandered lines, sinusoidal lines or saw-tooth lines. By means of winding lines, the area of the coupled lines is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> There are six preferred embodiments illustrated in this invention. The first preferred embodiment uses coupled lines formed spirally and has low impedance at the balanced ports. Inserting a trimming section of transmission lines to this device can adjust the phase and amplitude balances between the balanced ports, and the impedance at the balanced output ports can be properly matched. The inserted transmission line trimming section can be capacitive or inductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The second preferred embodiment also uses coupled lines formed spirally and has a low impedance at the balanced ports. However, each terminal of the balanced ports is formed in a separate dielectric layer. Therefore, the location of the balanced ports is easier to design and the bandwidth is increased because the length of the transmission line is increased. Also, inserting a trimming section of transmission line to this device can adjust the phase and amplitude balances between the balanced ports, and the impedance at the balanced ports can be properly matched. The inserted transmission line trimming section can be capacitive or inductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The third preferred embodiment also uses coupled lines formed spirally and has a high impedance at the balanced ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The fourth preferred embodiment also uses coupled lines formed spirally and has a low impedance at the balanced ports. The fifth preferred embodiment also uses coupled lines formed spirally and has a high impedance at the balanced ports. Both embodiments use metal plates to connect to side-electrodes. Therefore, the width of the sections of broadside coupled line that originally needs to be wide is narrowed and the number of wiring is increased. If metal plates can not be connected to side-electrodes, the connection among ground planes and metal plates can be designed by via holes so that the width of sections of the broadside coupled line can be narrowed and the number of wiring can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The sixth preferred embodiment removes the inside grounded metal isolation layers in the balun structure shown in the above-mentioned five embodiments in order to reduce the number of layers and simplify the fabrication of components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The operating efficiency of the baluns of this invention is analyzed based on the multi-layer circuit structures with and without grounded metal isolation layers. The results show that the amplitude difference is less than 0.5 dB and the phase difference is less than 3 degrees under the conditions of an operating frequency range 200 MHz and a center frequency 2.44 GHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood from a careful reading of a detailed description provided herein below with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The unbalanced port <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is an input terminal and two balanced ports <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are output terminals.

The first balanced port <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connects through a metal wire <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the coupled line <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the second balanced port <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connects to the coupled line <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through a metal wire <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The most left section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>has its first coupled line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>na </italic></highlight>connected to the unbalanced port <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> through the strip line <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, and its second coupled line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>nb </italic></highlight>to the ground <highlight><bold>777</bold></highlight> through a metal wire <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The second coupled line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>mb </italic></highlight>of the most right section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>is connected through a metal wire <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the ground <highlight><bold>777</bold></highlight>, and its first coupled line <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>ma </italic></highlight>is left open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Except for the input terminal, the coupled lines have completely symmetric structures on two sides with respect to the center geometrically as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Both phase and magnitude are well balanced at the balanced ports. By adjusting the width and the length of each section of broadside coupled lines or the thickness of each layer, the impedance at the balanced ports can be matched properly and the size of the device can be reduced. In practice, the broadside coupled lines in the first embodiment can be a symmetric or asymmetric structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows another equivalent circuit of the multi-layer radio frequency chip balun by inserting a trimming section of transmission line between two coupled lines to extend the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> according to the invention. In addition to increasing the phase and amplitude balances between the balanced ports, the complicated impedance between the balanced and unbalanced ports can also be properly matched when the impedance of the input/output terminals has a complex value. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the transmission line trimming section <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> has a first end connected to one end of the coupled line <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through a strip line <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and a second end to one end of the coupled line <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through a strip line <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In practice, the transmission line trimming section <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> can be capacitive or inductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiments of this invention, multiple sections of coupled lines can be incorporated. The coupled lines are manufactured with winding lines such as spiral lines, meandered lines, sinusoidal lines, and saw-tooth lines as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>By means of these winding lines, the size of the balun can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Because the coupled lines of this invention have symmetric structures on two sides with respect to the center geometrically, it is possible to reduce the size of the balun significantly by moving half of the symmetric structure above to form a structure which is also symmetric from top to bottom. A symmetric structure extending upwards and downwards can be formed to take advantage of a multi-layer structure and to reduce the size of the balun. The followings are several preferred embodiments of multi-layer structures that are symmetric from top to bottom. </paragraph>

Only the first and second ground planes are left, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the preferred material for forming the coupled lines, transmission lines, or ground planes is a low loss metallic material such as Ag, Pd, Cu, Au, or Ni. Assuming a ceramic dielectric constant &isin;<highlight><subscript>r</subscript></highlight>&equals;7.8 and a center frequency f<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;2.44 GHz, the operating efficiency of the baluns of this invention is analyzed based on the multi-layer circuit structures with and without grounded metal isolation layers. The characteristics for the return loss S<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>as well as the insertion losses S<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>are measured and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for the circuits of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> respectively. In the figures, the vertical axis is the amplitude of the measured loss in dB. The horizontal axis shows the operating frequency of the balun from 2 to 3 GHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In a high frequency circuit, the measured voltage and current are fluctuated like waves whose values may vary with locations. To characterize a circuit using the scattering parameter (S parameter), the impedance characteristic of the transmission line connected to each port has to be preset. The return loss S<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>should be less than &minus;10 dB in the designed frequency range, i.e., 2.34-2.54 GHz. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the return loss is less than &minus;10 dB that means that the balun has good impedance match and the energy loss is very small. As far as the insertion losses S<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>31</subscript></highlight>, the energy should be distributed equally in the two ports with some loss due to the material. The loss shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is less than &minus;3 dB that indicates that the energy has been equally distributed and the balanced ports receive most of the energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show the measured differences in amplitude and phase within the operating frequency range for the two circuits. The horizontal axis is the operating frequency of the balun in GHz. The vertical axis shows the differences in degree and dB for phase and amplitude respectively. As can be seen, within an operating frequency range 200 MHz, the amplitude difference is less than 0.5 dB and the phase difference is less than 3 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> According to the multi-layer radio frequency chip balun of the invention, the drawbacks of the conventional baluns have been overcome. The size of the device has been significantly reduced and the operating frequency bandwidth is increased. The impedance between the balanced and unbalanced ports can be matched properly. The device can be fabricated with low dielectric constant materials. In addition to the reduction in cost, the stability of the device is also improved. Therefore, the baluns of this invention can be fabricated with a micro-chip size and suitably used in a wireless network or personal communication. </paragraph>
