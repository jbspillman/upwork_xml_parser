<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof, in particular, to a semiconductor device, which has a trench separation band, and a manufacturing method thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Insulating separation bands are provided in many places of a semiconductor substrate in a semiconductor device such as a DRAM (dynamic random access memory), an SRAM (static random access memory) and a flash memory. Though LOCOS (local oxidation of silicon) separation has been in conventional use, as the miniaturization of the above described semiconductor devices has progressed, trench separation bands suitable for miniaturization have come to be exclusively used for separation bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Next, a process for a general trench separation band is described in reference to the figures. First, a base silicon oxide layer (SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, whose thickness is, for example, 50 nm, is formed on a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Base silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed for the purpose of height adjustment of the trench separation band. Then, a polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, whose thickness is 100 nm, is deposited on the base silicon oxide layer. In addition, a silicon nitride layer (SiN film) <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, whose thickness is 300 nm, is deposited thereon (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). Silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> functions as a stopper layer during CMP polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> After this, a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is formed which corresponds to regions where the trench separation bands are desired to be provided. Then, silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is patterned by using this photoresist pattern as a mask (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). After this, photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is removed. Then, polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are etched by using patterned silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as a mask. Furthermore, a trench <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, whose depth is, for example, 0.5 &mgr;m, is created in the silicon substrate by using these patterns as a mask (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>). Polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> makes it easy for an inner wall silicon oxide film to be formed. In addition to this, polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> protects the silicon substrate at the time when the silicon oxide film filled into the trench separation band is etched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> After this, the damaged layer on the trench surface is removed and, after that, a silicon oxide film (hereinafter referred to as inner wall oxide film) <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed in the inner wall of the trench with a thickness of, for example, 120 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). This inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> functions as a short circuit prevention insulating film of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as described below. In addition, at the same time, it functions as a layer that relieves stress due to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the filled-in silicon oxide film (hereinafter referred to as filed-in oxide film), which is filled into the trench, and silicon substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Next, the above described filled-in insulating layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is deposited with a thickness of 1 &mgr;m so as to fill in trench <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, on which inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has been formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>). After this, CMP polishing is carried out by utilizing slurry, whose main component is silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). As for CMP polishing, the polishing rates within the wafer surface area are taken into consideration and polishing is carried out until, at least, silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is exposed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> At the time of this CMP polishing the unevenness of the polishing rates is taken into consideration and over-etching is carried out to the degree of 10% of the thickness of an HDP (High Density Plasma) film. As a result of this over-etching, in some regions 100 nm of silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is polished off. After this, etching is carried out by using an HF liquid so as to make filled-in oxide film <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> lower by 250 nm for the purpose of adjustment of the height of the trench separation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). Next, the silicon nitride layer, the polycrystalline silicon layer and the base silicon oxide layer are removed. As a result of this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22, a</cross-reference> trench separation band, whose height from the silicon substrate surface is approximately 50 nm, that is, in the range of 0 nm to 100 nm, can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A trench separation band which has a conventional width can be formed by using the above described method. In the formation of the trench separation band with a conventional width, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the top surface of the trench oxide film and the top surface of the silicon nitride layer become a shared surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> When a trench silicon oxide layer (hereinafter referred to as trench oxide layer or trench oxide film) is filled into a wide trench in order to form a wide trench separation band by means of the above described method, however, trench oxide layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in a form as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is formed. After this, the trench oxide layer is polished through CMP polishing and silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is exposed. At this time, the top surface of trench silicon oxide film (hereinafter referred to as trench oxide film or trench oxide layer) <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the wide trench becomes lower than the top surface of silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> so as to form a recess in a dish form (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>). This trench oxide film is, in some cases, referred to as a filled-in oxide film in the description hereinafter. Concretely, the top surface of filled-in oxide film <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the wide trench is, for example, 100 nm lower than the top surface of silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> After this, etching is carried out by using an HF liquid so as to reduce the thickness of the filled-in oxide film by, for example, 250 nm for the purpose of adjustment of the height of the trench separation band. In some cases as a result of this etching by using the HF liquid, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, silicon substrate <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is exposed beneath an edge portion of base silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the upper portion of a sidewall of the wide trench. After this, when polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is removed through etching, the exposed portion of the silicon substrate, which is also made of silicon, is etched. As a result of this, the exposed portion of silicon is scooped out in an inward direction and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26, a</cross-reference> cavity <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the case that such a scooping out occurs, the wide trench separation band cannot sufficiently function so as to isolate, without fail, respective regions in the silicon substrate by means of an insulating layer. Therefore, a short circuit, or the like, occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A phenomenon wherein a silicon substrate is scooped out due to etching of a filled-in oxide film in a trench separation band, as described above, is known conventionally and several methods for preventing the silicon substrate from being scooped out have been proposed. For example, a method has been proposed wherein the filled-in oxide film is etched after being flattened through polishing so that the difference in the levels of the oxide film in the active region on which semiconductor elements are to be formed (Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-68365). In this method, however, the creation of a recess in a dish form is not supposed to occur through CMP polishing of the filled-in insulating layer of the wide trench separation band. Therefore, it cannot be used for the formation of the wide trench separation band which is the subject of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition, a method has been proposed wherein a thermal oxide film, which has strong withstanding properties against etching, is formed not only on the inner walls of the trench but, also, on the side surfaces of the filled-in oxide film which protrudes above the silicon substrate surface (Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 10-340950). However, this method is not effective in the case that a recess in a dish form occurs through CMP polishing in the filled-in insulating layer of the wide trench separation band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the case that intervals of active regions <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> wherein semiconductor elements are formed become wide, a structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is conventionally provided since wide separation regions cannot be manufactured. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27 a</cross-reference> number of dummy active regions <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are aligned between active regions <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> so that trench separation band <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed among the regions. The base part is strengthened because of the alignment of dummy active regions <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> so that a recess in a dish form does not occur after the CMP polishing process. Length L1 of one side of the above described dummy active regions is, for example, 2 &mgr;m to 5 &mgr;m, intervals S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>between dummy active regions are, for example, 2 &mgr;m to 5 &mgr;m and intervals S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>between dummy active regions and active regions <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> wherein semiconductor elements are formed are, for example, 2 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the case that the above described dummy active regions are formed it is necessary to prepare a fine, complex pattern on a CAD. In many cases this task on CAD is complex and time consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the case that wires are arranged on the separation bands, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, one wire is divided into two wires <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and dummy active regions are aligned in the separation bands in order to avoid the formation of a large separation band. Size L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the dummy active regions in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> is, for example, 2 &mgr;m to 5 &mgr;m, intervals S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>between the dummy active regions are, for example, 2 &mgr;m to 5 &mgr;m, and distances S<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>between the dummy active regions and the wires are, for example, 2 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the case that a structure as described above is adopted, (a) the layout of wires <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> become greatly limited and (b) useless regions, that is to say regions of the width (L<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;2S<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), are formed between the wires. Such useless regions have become a great hindrance to the miniaturization of semiconductor elements. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The main purpose of the present invention is to provide a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device wherein a trench separation band, wherein no scooping out of the silicon substrate occurs, is formed even when the trench separation band is a wide trench separation band and to provide a semiconductor device which includes such a trench separation band. By achieving this main purpose it becomes unnecessary to arrange complex dummy active regions and a secondary purpose of the invention is to divide wires so as to make it unnecessary to form useless regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A manufacturing method of a semiconductor device of the present invention is provided with the steps of forming a multilayer film which includes a silicon oxide layer on the main surface of a silicon substrate, a polycrystalline silicon layer positioned in a layer above the silicon oxide layer and a silicon nitride layer positioned in a layer above the polycrystalline silicon layer. This process is further provided with the step of patterning the multilayer film and, in addition, etching the silicon substrate to create a trench for element separation, the step of oxidizing the surfaces of the inner walls of the trench which includes the sidewalls of the multilayer film so as to form an inner wall silicon oxide film which covers the inner walls and the step of forming a trench oxide layer which fills in the trench covered by the inner wall silicon oxide film and which contacts the top surface of the silicon nitride layer. In addition, this process is provided with the step of polishing the trench oxide layer and the silicon nitride layer through CMP polishing so as to expose the silicon nitride layer to the predetermined thickness of the thickness of the silicon nitride layer and the step of etching the trench oxide film, which is formed by polishing the trench oxide layer through CMP polishing, by a thickness no more than the thickness of the inner wall silicon oxide film for the purpose of adjustment of the height of the trench separation band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the above described structure, the silicon substrate is not exposed through etching for the purpose of height adjustment, however the deep central portion of the top surface of the trench oxide film (filled-in oxide film) becomes through the creation of a recess in a dish form by means of a CMP polishing process in the wide trench separation band. In the wide trench separation band the edge portions of the silicon substrate are protected by the inner wall oxide film, which is not changed after formation, and by the trench oxide film, wherein a recess is created in a dish form and which sits on the inner wall oxide film before the etching for height adjustment. That is to say, the edge portions of the silicon substrate are protected by, at least, the inner wall silicon oxide film, which is not changed after formation. In the case that the trench oxide film is etched by a thickness no more than the thickness of the inner wall silicon oxide film through etching for height adjustment, the inner wall silicon oxide film, which is also made of silicon oxide, is not etched completely. Therefore, the edge portions of the silicon substrate are not exposed through the etching for height adjustment of the trench separation band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> After this, a selective etching is carried out for removing the polycrystalline silicon layer on the silicon substrate. In the case that the edge portions of the silicon substrate are exposed, the silicon substrate is etched and is scooped out by the etching liquid for etching the polycrystalline silicon. However, the edge portions of the silicon substrate are not exposed and, therefore, the silicon substrate is not scooped out through this etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> After removing this polycrystalline silicon layer, the silicon oxide layer as the base is removed through etching and at this time though the trench oxide layer, which is also made of silicon oxide, is etched, the silicon substrate is not etched. Therefore, the silicon substrate is not scooped out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In summary, in the above structure the edge portions of the silicon substrate are neither exposed after the etching for height adjustment of the trench separation band nor before the etching of the polycrystalline silicon and, therefore, the silicon substrate is not scooped out. Here, in the above described multilayer film, a polycrystalline silicon layer is arranged between the silicon nitride layer, which becomes a stopper layer at the time of CMP polishing, and the base silicon oxide layer, and the reasons for this are as follows. At the time of oxidation processing of the inner walls for forming the inner wall silicon oxide film, the inner wall silicon oxide film is formed through the oxidation of the edge portions of the polycrystalline silicon layer. The inner wall silicon oxide film formed in the edge portions of this polycrystalline silicon layer becomes upwardly raised from the main surface of the silicon substrate in the first trench separation band so that an electric field concentration can be avoided. The above described polycrystalline silicon layer is formed in this manner for the purpose of avoiding electric field concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Here, the above described etching for height adjustment of the trench separation band is an etching for the purpose of adjustment of the height of the trench separation band of a conventional width wherein a recess in a dish form does not occur due to a CMP polishing process. At the time of this etching for height adjustment, a trench separation band of a conventional width is, of course, etched by the same thickness as of the trench oxide film of a wide trench separation band. This etching for height adjustment is adjusted according to the time of immersion in the etching liquid in accordance with the concentration, temperature, or the like, of the etching liquid. In addition, in the case of dry etching, the adjustment is carried out by changing predetermined adjustment factors concerning the etching thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, the sum of the thickness of the silicon nitride layer and the thickness of the polycrystalline silicon layer after CMP polishing can be made greater in comparison with the thickness of the inner wall silicon oxide film by a value no less than the difference gained by subtracting the amount of change of the maximum dispersion of the etching for the purpose of adjustment to a desired height from a desired separation height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this structure the silicon substrate is prevented from being scooped out in a wide trench separation band while the height, from the silicon substrate surface, of a trench separation band of the conventional width is made to be approximately 50 nm, that is, the height of the conventional separation band or to be in the range of 0 nm to 100 nm. That is to say, in the trench separation band of the conventional width, the top surface of the trench oxide layer after a CMP polishing process is at the same level as the top surface of the silicon nitride layer. That is to say, when the thickness of the silicon nitride layer after CMP polishing is t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, the thickness of the polycrystalline silicon layer is t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the thickness of the silicon oxide layer is t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the top surface of the trench oxide layer after the CMP polishing process is at the height of (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) from the silicon substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> After this, an amount of etching no greater than the thickness of the inner wall silicon oxide film is carried out for height adjustment. When the maximum value of thickness reduction through this etching is d, the height, from the silicon substrate surface, of the top surface of the trench oxide film after etching for height adjustment becomes (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus;d) After this, the trench oxide film is etched when the silicon oxide layer on the silicon substrate is removed through etching. At the time when the silicon oxide layer on the silicon substrate is removed through etching, the trench oxide film is etched by approximately the same thickness as of the silicon oxide layer. As a result, the height, from the silicon substrate surface, of the top surface of the trench oxide layer becomes (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;d) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is desirable for this height to be approximately 50 nm, that is, the height of conventional separation band or, at least, to be in the range of 0 nm to 100 nm. Here, at the time of the etching for height adjustment, the thickness d of the inner wall silicon oxide layer is not etched but, rather, the maximum dispersion amount of the etching for height adjustment, that is to say, for example, the thickness is etched off to be reduced by approximately 20 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, it is preferable for the silicon nitride layer to be formed to a thickness which includes the thickness to be reduced in the CMP polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In this structure the CMP polishing is stopped without fail by the silicon nitride layer, which is a stopper layer in the CMP polishing process and the multilayer film on the silicon substrate can be protected in the etching for height adjustment of the trench separation band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, the trench oxide layer can be formed so that the etching rate for the trench oxide film in the etching for height adjustment is greater than the etching rate of the inner wall silicon oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In this structure etching is carried out so as to reduce the trench oxide film to a predetermined thickness and, in addition, protection of the silicon substrate can be ensured by means of the inner wall silicon oxide film. Here, it is not desirable to make the etching rate of the trench oxide layer too small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, an oxide layer can be formed by using an HDP (high density plasma) method at the time of the formation of the trench oxide layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A silicon oxide layer (filled-in oxide film) of high density can be formed by means of an HDP method. Thereby, the insulation of the trench separation band can be ensured. As for this trench insulating layer, a TEOS (tetra ethyl ortho silicate) film may be formed or an HTO (high temperature oxidation) film may be formed by means of a CVD method instead of an HDP film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, fluoric acid can be used for the etching which is carried out for height adjustment of the trench separation band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In this structure the trench oxide layer can be selectively etched at a high etching rate. In addition, dry etching may be used for the above described etching for height adjustment of the trench separation band. Though, in some cases, the trench oxide layer cannot be selectively etched through dry etching, the edge portions of the silicon substrate are not exposed as long as the trench oxide layer is etched by an amount that is no greater than the thickness of the inner wall silicon oxide film. The portions of the silicon substrate in the periphery portions of the trench are protected by the silicon nitride layer, the polycrystalline silicon layer and the silicon oxide layer. These portions are not removed as long as the inner wall silicon oxide film is not removed through etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, the trench is created in a large separation band region of the silicon substrate, which includes at least one active region in the plan view, through the etching of the separation region between the external periphery walls of the active regions formed along the peripheries of respective active regions included in the large separation band region and the inner periphery walls of the large separation band region formed along the periphery of the large separation band region while the inner wall silicon oxide film is formed on the external periphery walls of the active regions and on the inner periphery walls of the large separation band region so that the trench oxide layer can be formed so as to fill in the above trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this structure it becomes unnecessary to align dummy active regions in the large separation band region and the time consuming task of forming a complex pattern on, for example, a CAD system in order to design the semiconductor device becomes unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, the trench can be created in the silicon substrate in a band form so as to include wires contacting the top surface of the interlayer insulating film on the silicon substrate in the plan view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, wires cannot be provided on places where the occurrence of parasitic capacitance is expected because the width of the wires is great and the thickness of the interlayer insulating film is small. Accordingly, the wire layout is greatly limited. In the above structure wide trench separation bands can be provided in the silicon substrate directly below the wires and, thereby, the thickness of the insulating layer can be made very great so that the parasitic capacitance can be ignored. As a result of this, it becomes possible to enlarge the freedom of the wire layout so as to contribute to, for example, the miniaturization of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, first and second wires are arranged side by side and the trench can be created as a region in a band form which includes the first and the second wires in the plan view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the case that two wires are provided as described above, a dummy active region is aligned between them in the plan view. This dummy active region between these wires is a useless region. In the above structure no dummy active region is arranged between the wires and this can contribute to the miniaturization of the semiconductor device. In addition, the wire layout can be freely carried out and this enlargement of the freedom of the layout can also contribute to the miniaturization of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor device of the present invention is a device which is provided with a first trench separation band portion and a second trench separation band portion which is wider than the first trench separation band portion. This device is a semiconductor device wherein the first and the second trench separation bands portions are manufactured through any of the above described processes for a semiconductor device of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this structure a wide trench separation band is formed without scooping out the silicon substrate and the height of a trench separation band of the conventional width can be made to be the same height according to a prior art. Therefore, the large separation region, wherein dummy active regions are conventionally aligned, can be formed of the wide trench separation band portion of the present invention. As a result of this, it becomes possible to eliminate the CAD task for forming the alignment to the dummy active regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor device of the present invention is a device which is provided with a first trench separation band portion and a second trench separation band portion which is wider than the first trench separation band portion on a silicon substrate. In this semiconductor device the position of the top surface of the first trench separation band portion is in a position approximately 50 nm, that is, in the range of 0 nm to 100 nm higher than the silicon substrate surface. In addition, the position of the top surface of the second trench separation band portion is in a position lower than the main surface of the silicon substrate, the thickness of the inner wall oxide film which covers the inner walls of the trench of the second trench separation band portion in the periphery portions of the trench is less than the thickness in the bottom portion of the trench and the second trench separation band portion has a width wherein a recess in a dish form occurs at the time of the CMP polishing of the silicon oxide film, which fills in the second trench portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this structure even in the case that the second trench separation band portion is a large separation region with the width wherein a recess in a dish form occurs at the time of CMP polishing, a wide trench separation band can be formed without scooping out the silicon substrate. At this time, the height of the trench separation band of conventional width can be in a conventional height range. As a result of this, the large separation region can be formed without using dummy active regions so that it becomes possible to omit the CAD task for forming the alignment of the dummy active regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In the above described semiconductor device of the present invention, the width of the second trench separation band portion can be 6 &mgr;m even in the narrowest place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Though even in the case of such a narrow width, conventionally, at least one dummy active region must be formed, in the above described structure dummy active regions can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the above described semiconductor device of the present invention, an active region wherein a semiconductor element is provided is included in the region of the second trench separation band portion and the external periphery walls surrounding the active region are covered with an inner wall silicon oxide film so that the width of the second trench separation band portion is formed of the width of that silicon oxide film which fills in the second trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It becomes possible to form the above described large separation region, which includes an active region, of a wide trench separation band of the present invention. As a result of this, the steps of the formation of dummy active regions can be omitted. The width of the wide trench separation band, even in the case the wide trench separation band portion includes an active region, is determined by the width of the trench oxide film which fills in the trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The above described semiconductor device of the present invention has an interlayer insulating film and wires contacting the top surface of the interlayer insulating film above the silicon substrate and the second trench separation band is arranged so as to include the wires with band sides running along the wires in the plan view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this structure, in some cases, a parasitic capacitance is formed of the wires and the impurity regions in the silicon substrate with the insulating film placed between them so as to become a cause of malfunction of the semiconductor device. Therefore, in some cases, the wire layout is greatly limited. In the above structure the wire layout can be freely carried out. As a result of this, the freedom of layout of wires can be enhanced. Furthermore, it becomes possible, for example, to use this increase in freedom of wire layout for the miniaturization of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the above described semiconductor device of the present invention, wires are formed of a plurality of wires which are parallel to each other and the second trench separation band can be arranged so as to include the plurality of wires with band sides running along the plurality of wires in the plan view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this structure the freedom of wire layout can be enhanced. Furthermore, dummy active regions, which occur as useless regions in the conventional structure, provided among the plurality of wires in the plan view can be omitted. As a result of this, it becomes possible to contribute to the miniaturization of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Next, the embodiments of the present invention are described in reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are views for describing a process for forming a wide trench separation band in a process according to a first embodiment of the present invention. First, an SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a base silicon oxide layer for height adjustment is formed on a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Next, a polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed on the top surface of the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film. Next, a silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on the top surface of polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This silicon nitride layer is made to be somewhat thin. In the present embodiment it is of a thickness of, for example, 150 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> After this, a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for providing a wide trench is formed on silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Next, this photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is used as a mask and silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is etched. Furthermore, they are used as a mask and a wide trench <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is provided in silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> After that, the inner wall surface of the wide trench is oxidized below silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so that the trench inner wall surface is covered with an inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The thickness of the inner wall oxide film is approximately 120 nm. At this time, silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> undergoes almost no oxidization. After this, a filled-in oxide film, of which the main component is silicon oxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is formed so as to fill in the wide trench covered with the inner wall oxide film by means of an HDP (high density plasma) method. In the description below a silicon oxide film formed by using an HDP method is referred to as an HDP film. The thickness of HDP film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is approximately 1000 nm (1 &mgr;m) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> At the time of the formation of the HDP film, argon (Ar), oxygen and silane (SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), of which mixture ratio is Ar/O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&equals;(40 to 100)/(40 to 100)/(40 to 100) sccm, are used as gas components. At this time, the chamber temperature at the time of film formation is approximately 100&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film may be filled in by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) without using high concentration plasma. In the case that a TEOS (tetra ethyl ortho silicate) film is filled in as the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film according to this CVD method, the ratio of the gas mixture is TEOS/N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;(80 to 120)/(180 to 220) sccm and the film is formed at 600&deg; C. to 700&deg; C. In addition, in the similar case wherein an HTO (high temperature oxidation) film filled in as the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film according to the CVD method, the film is formed of DCS (di-chloro silane)/N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O/N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;(130 to 170)/(130 to 170)/(450 to 550) sccm at 720&deg; C. to 780&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> After the above trench is filled in with the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film, HDP film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the silicon nitride film are polished through CMP polishing until silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is exposed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram showing the condition where silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is exposed as a result of the above described CMP polishing. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> recess in a dish form is created in the HDP film, which fills in the large separation trench through CMP polishing. The top surface of HDP film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is lower than the top surface of silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> due to the above recess in a dish form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the difference &Dgr;h between the heights of HDP film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the time of completion of CMP polishing becomes approximately 200 nm due to the recess in a dish form. As a result of this, the height of the top surface of HDP film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is approximately at the same height as the surface of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> After this, in etching the HDP film by using fluoric acid for the purpose of height adjustment of the trench separation, the depth of etching is controlled to be approximately 100 nm, which is thinner than the thickness d of the inner wall oxide film (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In the etching for the purpose of height adjustment of the filled-in oxide film, the depth of etching is made to be shallower than the thickness d of the inner wall oxide film. As a result of this, the silicon substrate does not become exposed regardless of how deep the position of the top surface of the filled-in oxide film becomes due to the recess in a dish form created through CMP polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> This etching for height adjustment may be wet etching, such as etching using an HF liquid, or may be a dry etching, such as a plasma etching. In the etching using an HF liquid, only the filled-in oxide film is etched and silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is not etched. In addition, when dry etching is used for height adjustment of the filled-in oxide film, not only filled-in oxide film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> but, also, silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is etched. In any case, as long as the depth of etching in the filled-in oxide film is no greater than the thickness d of the inner wall oxide film, the silicon substrate does not become exposed at the point in time after this etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In the case of dry etching, the silicon nitride film, the polycrystalline silicon film and the base silicon film are all etched. However, the sum of the thicknesses of base silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, polycrystalline silicon film <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and silicon nitride film <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be easily made thicker than the sum of the thickness of the inner wall oxide film and the thickness of filled-in oxide film in the above corners of the trench. Therefore, the silicon substrate does not become exposed at the point in time after the above described etching for height adjustment of the trench separation band (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> When the silicon substrate is not exposed at the time of etching of the polycrystalline silicon, the silicon substrate is covered with inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. This inner wall oxide film is not reduced in thickness through the subsequent etching for removal of the polycrystalline silicon layer. Accordingly, the silicon substrate is not scooped out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> A trench separation band of the conventional width is also formed at the same time as the formation of the above described wide trench separation band. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a cross section view at the stage when the filled-in oxide film is polished through CMP polishing in the trench of the conventional width. The filled-in oxide film of the conventional width is different from that of the wide trench in that a recess in a dish form does not occur therein. Therefore, the top surface of the filled-in oxide film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is in a plane in common with the top surface of silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the top surface of the filled-in oxide film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is located in a position (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) higher than the surface of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Here, t<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is the thickness of the silicon nitride layer, t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the thickness of the polycrystalline silicon layer and t<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is the thickness of the base silicon oxide layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, etching is carried out on the filled-in oxide film for the purpose of height adjustment. In the present invention an amount of thickness no more than the thickness d of inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is reduced through this etching for the purpose of height adjustment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a view where etching is carried out so as to reduce the maximum amount to thickness d. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the top surface of the filled-in oxide film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is located at a position (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus;d) higher than the surface of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In a conventional etching for height adjustment, however, dispersion of wet etching is taken into consideration and the amount of etching is reduced by the maximum dispersion amount. For example, in the case that the thickness of the inner wall oxide film is 120 nm, usually etching is carried out to an amount approximately 20 nm thinner than the thickness of the inner wall silicon film. Accordingly, thickness d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, which is reduced through the etching at this time, may be considered to be (d&minus;20 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and base silicon oxide layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are removed by using different etching liquids, respectively. The filled-in oxide film is formed of silicon oxide film. Therefore, the filled-in oxide film is slightly etched when etching is carried out to remove silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. At the time of the etching off of base silicon oxide film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, however, the filled-in oxide film is etched off by approximately the same thickness t<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>as of the base silicon oxide film. Therefore, the final height of the top surface of the filled-in oxide film from the silicon substrate surface becomes (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>). The thickness of the silicon nitride layer, the thickness of the polycrystalline silicon layer, or the like, are set so that this height becomes the same desired height as in the prior art, which is approximately 50 nm, that is to say, in the range of 0 nm to 100 nm. Usually, d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is set to be smaller than thickness d of the inner wall oxide film by the maximum dispersion amount of wet etching. In addition, due to etching to remove silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and polycrystalline silicon layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and due to other cleaning processes, the filled-in oxide film is, practically, reduced in thickness and, therefore, (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) is set to be of a height that is no greater than the height of the desired filled-in oxide film, that is to say, it is set so as to be (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)&gE;(desired thickness). In other words, (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is set to be higher than the height gained by adding a desired filled in thickness to the amount wet etching for height adjustment, that is to say, it is set so as to be (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)&gE;(desired height&plus;d<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>). Furthermore, in other words, (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is set so as to be greater than the thickness of the inner wall oxide film by no smaller than the amount gained by subtracting the maximum dispersion amount of wet etching from the desired filled in height. For example, (t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is set so as to be larger than the inner wall oxide film by no less than 30 nm. In addition, the above thickness t<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of the substantial is the thickness after the overetching to the amount of approximately several % to 10% of the first thickness of the filled-in oxide film by means of a CMP polishing process and, therefore, the film is formed so as to include that amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Next, a concrete example of a trench separation band of the conventional width is described. In a trench of the conventional width, the height of the top surface of HDP film <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is approximately 200 nm higher than the silicon substrate at the point in time after CMP polishing is carried out. After this, etching for height adjustment (d&minus;20 nm) is carried out and, in addition, the base SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film is removed and, then, the top surface of the HDP film, which fills in the trench of the conventional width, is located approximately 50 nm higher than the silicon substrate surface. This height is, of course, the same height as of the trench separation band of a conventional width which is manufactured by a conventional process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, by manufacturing a trench separation band according to the process of the present invention, (a1) a wide trench separation band can, without fail, be formed without allowing the scooping out of the silicon substrate, or the like, to occur, irregardless of the trench width and (a2) a trench separation band of the conventional width can be formed of the height of the same level as in a prior art. Conventionally, since a trench separation band of a large width cannot be formed, dummy active regions, or the like, are formed by forming a complex photoresist pattern. According to the process of the present invention, a separation band of a necessary size can be easily formed in a necessary position. Therefore, the following effects can be gained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> (A1) A highly complex task on a CAD for designing a photoresist pattern can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> (A2) Conventionally, the positions for wires are limited in order to avoid a parasitic capacitance which occurs along with wiring. The parasitic capacitance can be avoided by providing a trench separation band for a large separation in the silicon substrate immediately below the wires according to the process of the present invention. Therefore, the freedom of design of the wiring pattern can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> (A3) Furthermore, in the case that a plurality of wires are arranged in parallel, dummy active regions are conventionally provided between the wires. It becomes unnecessary to provide dummy active regions since a trench separation band of a great width is provided directly beneath the above described wires. Therefore, it becomes possible to miniaturize the size of the semiconductor chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> (Second Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, active regions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in which semiconductor elements are formed are surrounded by a wide trench separation band. Inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed on the walls of the trench surrounding these active regions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> works as a protective film for preventing the silicon substrate from being exposed at the time of etching for height adjustment or etching for removal of the base silicon oxide film during the formation of the wide trench separation band <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A process of forming the wide trench separation band in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is the same as the process for a wide trench separation band in the first embodiment as shown in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (S1) A multilayer film made of a base silicon oxide film/polycrystalline silicon film/silicon nitride film is formed on a silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> (S2) A wide trench is created in the silicon substrate by manufacturing a photoresist pattern for the wide trench separation band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (S3) An inner wall silicon oxide film is formed on the inner walls of the wide trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (S4) A filled in silicon oxide film is formed so as to fill in the wide trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (S5) The silicon nitride film is exposed by polishing the filled in silicon oxide film and the silicon nitride film through a CMP polishing process. The polishing is adjusted so that, at the point in time of the completion of the CMP polishing, the sum of (thickness t<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of silicon nitride film)&plus;(thickness t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of polycrystalline silicon film) is the sum of the &ldquo;thickness d of inner wall oxide film&rdquo; and the &ldquo;height gained by subtracting the maximum dispersion of the etching for height adjustment from the desired height of the trench separation,&rdquo; or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> (S6) When etching for height adjustment of the filled in silicon oxide film is carried out, the filled in silicon oxide film is etched off by an amount not greater than the thickness of the above inner wall oxide film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> (S7) Etching is carried out the remove the multilayer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The above described process for a wide trench separation band is applied to the entirety of the wide trench separation bands in the embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27, a</cross-reference> wide trench separation band cannot be formed in the case that the intervals between the active regions wherein semiconductor elements are provided are wide. Therefore, as described above, a number of dummy active regions of a complex pattern are provided. By forming a wide trench separation region according to the process of the present invention, it becomes unnecessary to manufacture a complex photoresist pattern wherein a number of dummy active regions are arranged. Therefore, the time consuming task of manufacturing a photoresist pattern by using a CAD can be eliminated. In addition, in comparison with the process steps of forming the above described dummy active regions, the process steps of forming the wide trench separation band of the present invention do not include a complex pattern and the process steps are simple. As a result of this, reduction of manufacturing cost due to the omission of a complex task with CAD is achieved and the production yield can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> (Third Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12 a</cross-reference> film wire <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is formed so as to contact an interlayer insulating film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Film wire <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is a wide conductor in a semiconductor device. Therefore, in the case that a separation band is not directly beneath the film wire, there is the risk of the occurrence of a parasitic capacitance which cannot be ignored between impurity regions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>within silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and film wire <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, however, the thickness of the dielectric layer between the film wires <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and silicon substrate can be made sufficiently thick by providing a wide trench separation band <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> directly beneath film wire <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> along the film wire. Therefore, a film wire can be arranged so as not to entail a risk of the occurrence of a parasitic capacitance. As a result of this, it becomes possible to increase the freedom of the wiring pattern to a great degree in the design of a semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The above described wide trench separation band for prevention of parasitic capacitance due to a wire is used, for example, in periphery region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which surrounds a memory array <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor memory device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. This periphery region is provided with decoder regions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a sense amplifier region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and there are some cases where a parasitic capacitance is recognized to have occurred along with wires in these regions. Conventionally in the case that a wide trench separation band cannot easily be formed, the wiring pattern is changed so that wires do not run above impurity regions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in order to prevent the occurrence of a parasitic capacitance. The wires occupy a large area in a semiconductor device and, therefore, the above described limitation of the wiring pattern makes the design of the semiconductor device difficult when the semiconductor device is required to be miniaturized. The present invention removes the above described limitation concerning the design of wires so as to greatly increase the freedom of the design of the wiring pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> (Fourth Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> two wires <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are arranged in parallel. These wires <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are formed so as to contact the top surface of the interlayer insulating film arranged on the silicon substrate in the same manner as wire <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In the same manner as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, inner wall oxide film <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed around active regions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the silicon substrate where semiconductor device elements are formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, two wires <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> have the minimum interval that can prevent a short circuit of the wires in the semiconductor device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In the conventional semiconductor device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28, a</cross-reference> dummy active region of the width (2S<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&plus;L<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) which is larger than the minimum interval necessary to prevent a short circuit is provided between the two wires in the plan view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> By providing a wide trench separation band according to the process of the present invention, however, it becomes unnecessary to provide a region of useless width (2S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;L<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) between the above described wires. Therefore, miniaturization of the semiconductor device can be furthered. In addition, the freedom of the wiring layout can be increased. It is possible to make this increase in the freedom of layout advantageously contribute to, for example, the miniaturization of the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Here, the above described two wires may be close to each other so as to have the minimum interval necessary to prevent a short circuit by allowing an insulating layer to intervene. In addition, in the case that division into two wires is not necessary, they may be integrated into one wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>
