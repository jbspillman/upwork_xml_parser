<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D designates a clothes input opening of the drum and F designates a filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The operation of the conventional clothes dryer with the above composition will be described as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When a power is applied to the driving motor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the drum <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotated by the belt <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and clothes in the drum <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are mixed. After the external air is heated as the fan <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C rotates, the air is supplied into the drum <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and dries wet clothes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Namely, when the fan <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C is operated the external air is sucked into the case <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the air is heated passing the heater <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and flown to the inside of the drum <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through the suction duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and the suction port <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The heated air flown into the drum dries the wet clothes and then is exhausted to the outside of the case <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the exhaust port <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the exhaust duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional clothes dryer, suction is operated by the indirect suction method that the suction force generated according to the operation of the fan <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C is consecutively transmitted from the exhaust duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>B, drum <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, suction duct <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A and heater <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, in case suction resistance is large, that is, in case a large amount of clothes are dried or much lint of clothes exists at the filter, suction efficiency of the heated air is decreased. Therefore, clothes drying efficiency is decreased or time for drying is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also, since the air is flown only by the suction force of a fan <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C in the air circulation process in such conventional clothes dryer, load of the driving motor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for driving the fan <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C increases, thus to cause often breakdowns. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Here, the first blowing portion <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>A has the exhaust duct <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generate a suction force at the suction duct <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and exhaust air which dried the clothes in the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the outside of the case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the exhaust duct <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The second blowing portion <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>B sucks the air flown into the case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and it pressurizes and pushes the air flown into the suction duct <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> through the heater <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by supplying the air exhausting to the front side of the heater <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as the amount of the air flown to the suction duct <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, the amount of the supplied air compared with the same load of the driving motor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is increased and accordingly, drying performance can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Also, time for drying clothes compared with the same amount of clothes is reduced and increase of load of the driving motor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is prevented even if the amount of clothes is increased, thus to reduce breakdowns of the clothes dryer caused by the driving motor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing the clothes dryer in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the clothes dryer in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, an exhaust duct <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and a suction increasing duct <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> are separated-installed at the both sides centering around a driving motor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a first fan <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and a second fan <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> are respectively positioned at the exhaust duct <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and suction increasing duct <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The driving shaft connected to the second fan <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> penetrates the suction increasing duct <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, being lengthened and a pulley <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is fixed to the end to rotate a drum <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by transmitting the driving force to a belt <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the suction increasing duct <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, a suction port <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed at a side and an exhaust port <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is positioned at the front of a heater <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to supply air into a suction duct <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Since another components except main components described above are same as the composition of the first embodiment of the present invention in such clothes dryer in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention, the description will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a longitudinal sectional view showing the clothes dryer in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the first and second embodiments of the present invention, a suction increasing duct is positioned and a centrifugal fan is installed in the suction increasing duct to exhaust air to the inlet of the heater. On the other hand, in the third embodiment of the present invention, an axial flow fan <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is installed at the right front of a heater <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to exhaust air to a suction duct <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Namely, the centrifugal fan <highlight><bold>281</bold></highlight> is installed in an exhaust duct <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> combined to a shaft of a driving motor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the axial flow fan <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> rotates at the right front of the heater <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> combined to the other shaft of the driving motor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A pulley <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> connected with a belt <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is installed at a shaft of the driving motor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> where the axial flow fan <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> is installed to rotate a drum <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the first, second and third embodiments of the present invention, two fans are installed in a driving motor to be rotary driven but a plurality of driving motors can be installed to respectively drive the two fans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Since the clothes dryer in accordance with the present invention compulsorily supplies air to the front of the suction duct and heater to increase the amount of air flown to the drum, drying performance can be improved by reducing initial heating time of the air flown to the drum and increasing the amount of circulating air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims. </paragraph>
