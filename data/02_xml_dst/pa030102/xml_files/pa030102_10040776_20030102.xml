<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a method for identifying compounds potentially useful for the treatment and prevention of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions in mammals. This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/866,027 to Piazza et al. Filed May 30, 1997. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Familial adenomatous polyposis (&ldquo;FAP&rdquo;) is an inherited disease where the victim&apos;s colon contains many polyps or adenomas virtually uncountable in most instances. Because such patients develop so many polyps or adenomas each of which has a significant risk of developing into a cancer&mdash;the typical treatment is surgical removal of the colon. In about 1983, Waddell discovered that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (&ldquo;NSAID&rdquo;) sulindac would cause colonic polyps (a type of pre-cancerous lesion) to regress and prevent their recurrence when that drug was administered to patients with FAP. Waddell&apos;s experience with sulindac in FAP patients was confirmed in several subsequent studies. Unfortunately, since sulindac and other NSAIDS aggravate the digestive tract (not to mention side effects involving kidney and interference with normal blood clotting) of patients to whom it has been chronically administered, it is not a practical treatment for FAP or any other cancer or precancerous indication (i.e., neoplasia) requiring long-term administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Waddell originally hypothesized that the mechanism of action of sulindac on colonic polyps involved the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG). (Waddell, W. R. et al., &ldquo;Sulindac for Polyposis of the Colon,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Journal of Surgical Oncology, </italic></highlight>24:83-87, 1983). Prostaglandin (&ldquo;PG&rdquo;) synthesis inhibition results from the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) caused by NSAIDs. A common benefit of NSAIDs is the reduction of inflammation, which is known to be caused by the reduction of PG levels. Since NSAIDs are known to inhibit COX, which inhibits PG synthesis, it is widely believed that the regression of colonic polyps is attributed to this property. In fact, notwithstanding recent discoveries to the contrary, it has become conventional wisdom that administration of an inhibitor of PG synthesis (e.g., an NSAID) to a patient with FAP or other precancerous or cancerous lesion will result in the regression of the lesion due to a reduction of PG levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recent discoveries, however, are leading scientists in a completely different direction&mdash;that it is not necessary to inhibit COX to treat neoplasia patients successfully. Pamukcu et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,774, disclosed that sulfonyl compounds, that were previously reported to be inactive as PG synthesis inhibitors (and therefore not an NSAID or an anti-inflammatory compound) unexpectedly inhibited the growth of a variety of neoplastic cells, including colon polyp cells. These sulfonyl derivatives have proven effective in rat models of colon carcinogenesis, and one variant (now referred to as exisulind) has proven effective in preliminary human clinical trials with FAP patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The importance of this discovery&mdash;and the de-linking of anti-neoplasitic activity and COX inhibition&mdash;cannot be overstated. If those two phenomena were related, there would be little hope for a safe NSAID therapy for FAP patients because the side effects of NSAIDs, such as gastric irritation, are also caused by COX inhibition. Prostaglandins play a protective function in the lining of the stomach. When NSAIDs are administered, COX is inhibited and PG levels are reduced: gastric irritation is a common result. Those side effects may not manifest themselves in short-term (acute) NSAID therapy. However, during long-term (chronic) NSAID therapy, gastric irritation, bleeding and ulceration are very common. In significant numbers of cases, NSAID therapy must be stopped due to the severity of those side effects and other potentially lethal side effects. Furthermore, the severity of such side effects increases with age, probably because natural PG levels in gastric mucosa falls with age. Thus, useful compounds for treating neoplastic lesions should desirably inhibit neoplastic cell growth, but should not inhibit COX. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventional methods for screening compounds may be used to find improved compounds that inhibit neoplastic cell growth. Under this scenario, drugs may be screened using in vitro models. But conventional in vitro screening methods could pass many compounds that later are shown to be ineffective in animal models because of a number of unanticipated problems, one of which may be that the in vitro screen is not predictive of efficacy. Animal model studies are time consuming and expensive. Therefore, a more precise in vitro screening method that provides predictive information for treating neoplasia is needed to screen compounds prior to human testing. Knowledge of a specific target for inhibiting human cancer would allow for greater precision and efficiency whereby highly effective and safe compounds can be identified prior to animal testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Presently, rational drug discovery methods are being applied in the pharmaceutical industry to improve methods for identifying clinically useful compounds. Typically, rational drug discovery methods relate to a &ldquo;lock and key&rdquo; concept whereby structural relationships between a therapeutic target molecule (lock) and pharmaceutical compounds (key) are defined. Such methods are greatly enhanced by specialty computer software that accesses databases of compounds to identify likely geometric fits with the target molecule. Unfortunately, to use these systems, one has to have insight to the target molecule (lock). The target may be an enzyme, a protein, a membrane or nuclear receptor, or a nucleic acid sequence, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In complex diseases, such as neoplasia, scientists have identified a number of potential targets. However, many of the drugs available for the treatment of neoplasia are non-specific and toxic to normal tissues, and are not indicated for precancer and used only when neoplastic cells progress to cancer. Greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in cancer may lead scientists on the path towards designing more specific antineoplastic drugs&mdash;drugs that can safely be administered earlier in the disease process. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a novel in vitro method for screening test compounds for their ability to treat and prevent neoplasia, especially pre-cancerous lesions, safely. In particular, the present invention provides a method for identifying test compounds that can be used to treat and prevent neoplasia, including precancerous lesions, with minimal side effects associated with COX inhibition and other non-specific interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of this invention, therefore, the screening method involves determining the COX inhibition activity of a test compound. Because the inventors have discovered a relationship between inhibition of cancer and inhibition of phosphodiesterase Type-5 isoenzyme (&ldquo;PDE5&rdquo;), this invention includes determining the PDE5 inhibition activity of the compound. Preferably, the screening method of this invention farther includes determining whether the compounds inhibit the growth of tumor cells in a cell culture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the screening method of this invention involves determining the COX inhibition activity of the compound, determining the PDE5 inhibition activity of the compound and determining whether the compound induces apoptosis in tumor cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> By screening compounds in this fashion, potentially beneficial and improved compounds can be identified more rapidly and with greater precision than possible in the past. Further benefits will be apparent from the detailed description that follows.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The method of this invention is useful to identify compounds that can be used to treat or prevent neoplasms, and which are not characterized by the serious side effects of conventional NSAIDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Cancer and precancer may be thought of as diseases that involve unregulated cell growth. Cell growth involves a number of different factors. One factor is how rapidly cells proliferate, and another involves how rapidly cells die. Cells can die either by necrosis or apoptosis depending on the type of environmental stimuli. Cell differentiation is yet another factor that influences tumor growth kinetics. Resolving which of the many aspects of cell growth is affected by a test compound is important to the discovery of a relevant target for pharmaceutical therapy. Screening assays based on this selectivity can be combined with tests to determine which compounds having growth inhibiting activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> This invention is the product of several important discoveries. First, the present inventors discovered that desirable inhibitors of tumor cell growth induce premature death of cancer cells by apoptosis (see, Piazza, G. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>55(14), 3110-16, 1995). Second, the present inventors unexpectedly discovered that compounds that selectively induce apoptosis without substantial COX inhibition also inhibit phosphodiesterase (&ldquo;PDE&rdquo;). In particular, and contrary to leading scientific studies, desirable compounds for treating neoplastic lesions selectively inhibit Type 5 isoenzyme form of phosphodiesterase (&ldquo;PDE5&rdquo;) (EC 3.1.4.17). PDE5 is one of at least seven isoenzymes of phosphodiesterase. PDE5 is unique in that it selectively degrades cyclic GMP, while the other types of PDE are either non-selective or degrade cyclic AMP. Preferably, desirable compounds do not substantially inhibit other phosphodiesterase types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention involves determining the cyclooxygenase inhibition activity of a given compound, and determining the PDE5 inhibition activity of the compound. The test compounds are scored for their probable ability to treat neoplastic lesions either directly by assessing their activities against specific cutoff values or indirectly by comparing their activities against known compounds useful for treating neoplastic lesions. A standard compound that is known to be effective for treating neoplastic lesions without causing gastric iritation is 5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-(p-methylsulfonylbenzylidene)-3-indenylacetic acid (&ldquo;exisulind&rdquo;). Other useful compounds for comparative purposes include those that are known to inhibit COX, such as indomethacin and the sulfide metabolite of sulindac: 5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-(p-methylsulfinylbenzylidene)-3-indenylacetic acid (&ldquo;sulindac sulfide&rdquo;). Other useful compounds for comparative purposes include those that are known to inhibit PDE5, such as 1-(3-chloroanilino)-4-phenyphthalazine (&ldquo;MY5445&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A test compound is clearly determined to be a promising candidate if it performs better than or comparable to exisulind and does not inhibit COX. In general, desirable compounds are those that inhibit PDE5 and inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis, but do not inhibit COX at pharmacologically accepted doses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;precancerous lesion&rdquo; includes syndromes represented by abnormal neoplastic, including dysplastic, changes of tissue. Examples include dysplastic growths in colonic, breast, prostate or lung tissues, or conditions such as dysplastic nevus syndrome, a precursor to malignant melanoma of the skin. Examples also include, in addition to dysplastic nevus syndromes, polyposis syndromes, colonic polyps, precancerous lesions of the cervix (i.e., cervical dysplasia), esophagus, lung, prostatic dysplasia, prostatic intraneoplasia, breast and/or skin and related conditions (e.g., actinic keraosis), whether the lesions are clinically identifiable or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;carcinoma&rdquo; or &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; refers to lesions which are cancerous. Examples include malignant melanomas, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colon cancer. As used herein, the terms &ldquo;neoplasia&rdquo; and &ldquo;neoplasms&rdquo; refer to both cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the abbreviation PG represents prostaglandin; PS represents prostaglandin synthetase; PGE<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>represents prostaglandin E<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; PDE represents phosphodiesterase; COX represents cyclooxygenase; RIA represents&mdash;radioimmunoassay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;PDE5&rdquo; refers to that enzyme and any of its isoforms that exhibit cGMP specific hydrolytic enzyme activities and high affinity cGMP binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, there is a method for treating patients in need of treatment for neoplasia by identifying compounds that exhibit substantial PDE5 inhibitory activity at pharmacologically acceptable doses, and administering one or more of those compounds to a patient in need thereof with neoplasia sensitive to the compound. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SCREENING PROTOCOLS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The following screening protocols, and alternative protocols, are provided to aid in the understanding of the preferred methods used to screen test compounds to determine their potential to treat or prevent neoplasia, especially pre-cancerous lesions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> 1. Determining COX Inhibitory Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> COX inhibition can be determined by either of two methods. One method involves measuring PGE<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>secretion by intact HL-60 cells following exposure to the compound being screened. The other method involves measuring the activity of purified cyclooxygenases (COXs) in the presence of the compound. Both methods involve protocols previously described in the literature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> 1.A. PGE<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>Secretion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Compounds of this can be evaluated to determine whether they inhibited the production of prostaglandin E<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(&ldquo;PGE<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;), according to procedures known in the art. For example, PGE<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>secreted from a cell can be measured using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit for PGE<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, such as commercially available from Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill. USA. Suitable cells include those which make an abundance of PG, such as HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells are human promyelocytes that are differentiated with DMSO in mature granulocytes. (See, Collins, S. J., Ruscetti, F. W., Gallagher, R. E. and Gallo, R. C., &ldquo;Normal Functional Characteristics of Cultured Human Promyelocytic Leukemia Cells (HL-60) After Induction of Differentiation By Dimethylsulfoxide&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>J. Exp. Med., </italic></highlight>149:969-974, 1979). These differentiated cells produce PGE<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>after stimulation with a calcium ionophore A23187 (see, Kargman, S., Prasit, P. and Evans, J. F., &ldquo;Translocation of HL-60 Cell 5-Lipoxygenase&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>266: 23745-23752, 1991). HL-60 are available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC:CCL240). They can be crown in a RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 &mgr;g/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at 37&deg; C. To induce myeloid differentiation, cells are exposed to 1.3% DMSO for 9 days and then washed and resuspended in Dulbecco&apos;s phosphate-buffered saline at 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The differentiated HL-60 cells (3&times;10<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>cells/ml) can be incubated for 15 min at 37&deg; C. in the presence of the compounds tested at the desired concentration. Cells are then stimulated by A23187 (5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>M) for 15 min. PGE<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>secreted into the external medium is measured as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> 1.B Purified Cyclooxygenases </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Two different forms of cyclooxygenase (COX-I and COX-2) have been reported in the literature to regulate prostaglandin synthesis. It is known that COX-2 represents the inducible form of COX while COX-I represents a constitutive form. COX-I activity can be measured using the method described by Mitchell et al. (&ldquo;Selectivity of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs as Inhibitors of Constitutive and Inducible Cyclooxygenase,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., </italic></highlight>90:11693-11697, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference) using COX-I purified from ram seminal vesicles as described by Boopathy &amp; Balasubramanian, &ldquo;Purification And Characterization Of Sheep Platelet Cyclooxygenase&rdquo; (<highlight><italic>Biochem. J., </italic></highlight>239:371-377, 1988, which is incorporated herein by reference). COX-2 activity can be measured using COX-2 purified from sheep placenta as described by Mitchell et al., 1993, supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity of a drug can be determined by methods known in the art. For example, Boopathy &amp; Balasubramanian, 1988, supra, described a procedure in which prostaglandin H synthase 1 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich.) is incubated at 37&deg; C. for 20 min with 100 &mgr;M arachidonic acid (Sigma Chemical Co.), cofactors (such as 1.0 mM glutathione, 1.0 mM hydroquinone, 0.625 &mgr;M hemoglobin and 1.25 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and the drug to be tested. Following incubation, the reaction can be terminated with trichloroacetic acid. Enzymatic activity can then be measured spectrophotometrically at 530 nm after stopping the reaction by adding thiobarbituric acid and malonaldehyde. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Obviously, a compound that exhibits minimal COX-I or COX-2 inhibitory activity in relation to its greater PDE5 inhibitory activity may not be entirely undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> 1.C. Analyzing Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The amount of inhibition is determined by comparing the activity of the cyclooxygenase in the presence and absence of the test compound. Residual or no COX inhibitory activity (i.e., less than about 25%) at a concentration of about 100 &mgr;M is indicative that the compound should be evaluated further for usefulness for treating neoplasia. Preferably, the IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>concentration should be greater than 1000 &mgr;M for the compound to be further considered potential use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 2. Determining Phosphodiesterase (PDE5) Inhibition Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Compounds can be screened for inhibitory effect on phosphodiesterase activity using either the enzyme isolated from any tumor cell line such as HT-29 or SW-480, or recombinant HS-PDE5, for example, or measuring cyclic nucleotide levels in whole cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> 2.A. Enzyme Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Phosphodiesterase activity can be determined using methods known in the art, such as a method using radioactive <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H cyclic GMP (cGMP)(cyclic 3&prime;,5&prime;-guanosine monophosphate) as the substrate for PDE5 enzyme. (Thompson, W. J., Teraski, W. L., Epstein, P. M., Strada, S. J., <highlight><italic>Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide Research, </italic></highlight>10:69-92, 1979, which is incorporated herein by reference). In brief, a solution of defined substrate <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-cGMP specific activity (0.2 &mgr;M; 100,000 cpm; containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 1 mg/ml BSA) is mixed with the drug to be tested in a total volume of 400 &mgr;l. The mixture is incubated at 30&deg; C. for 10 minutes with partially purified PDE5 isolated from HT-29 cells. Reactions are terminated, for example, by boiling the reaction mixture for 75 seconds. After cooling on ice, 100 &mgr;l of 0.5 mg/ml snake venom (O. Hannah venom available from Sigma) is added and incubated for 10 min at 30&deg; C. This reaction is then terminated by the addition of an alcohol, e.g. 1 ml of 100% methanol. Assay samples are applied to a anion chromatography column (1 ml Dowex, from Aldrich) and washed with 1 ml of 100% methanol. The amount of radioactivity in the breakthrough and the wash from the columns in then measured with a scintillation counter. The degree of PDE5 inhibition is determined by calculating the amount of radioactivity in drug-treated reactions and comparing against a control sample (a reaction mixture lacking the tested compound). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> 2.B. Cyclic Nucleotide Measurements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the ability for desirable compounds to inhibit PDE5 is reflected by an increase in cGMP in neoplastic cells exposed to a compound being screened. The amount of PDE5 activity can be determined by assaying for the amount of cyclic GMP in the extract of treated cells using radioimmunoassay (RIA). In this procedure, HT-29 or SW-480 cells are plated and grown to confluency. The test compound is then incubated with the cell culture at a concentration of compound between about 200 &mgr;M to about 200 pM. About 24 to 48 hours thereafter, the culture media is removed from the cells, and the cells are solubilized. The reaction is stopped by using 0.2N HCl/50%-MeOH. A sample is removed for protein assay. Cyclic GMP is purified from the acid/alcohol extracts of cells using anion-exchange chromatography, such as a Dowex column. The cGMP is dried, acetylated according to published procedures, such as using acetic anhydride in triethylamine, (Steiner, A. L., Parker, C. W., Kipnis, D. M., <highlight><italic>J. Biol Chem., </italic></highlight>247(4): 1106-13, 1971, which is incorporated herein by reference). The acetylated cGMP is quantitated using radioimmunoassay procedures (Harper, J., Brooker, G., <highlight><italic>Advances in Nucleotide Research, </italic></highlight>10:1-33, 1979, which is incorporated herein by reference). Iodinated ligands (tyrosine metheyl ester) of derivatized cyclic GMP are incubated with standards or unknowns in the presence of antisera and appropriate buffers. Antiserum may be produced using cyclic nucleotide-haptene directed techniques. The antiserum is from sheep injected with succinyl-cGMP-albumin conjugates and diluted 1/20,000. Dose-interpolation and error analysis from standard curves are applied as described previously (Seibert, A. F., Thompson, W. J., Taylor, A., Wilbourn, W. H., Barnard, J. and Haynes, J., <highlight><italic>J. Applied Physio., </italic></highlight>79:389-395, 1992, which is incorporated hereinby reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In addition, the culture media may be acidified, frozen (&minus;70&deg; C.) and also analyzed for cGMP and cAMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In addition to observing increases in content of cGMP caused by desirable test compounds, decreases in content of cAMP have been observed. It has been observed that a particularly desirable compound (i.e. one that selectively induces apoptosis in neoplastic cells, but not substantially in normal cells) follows a time course consistent with PDE5 inhibition as one initial action resulting in an increased cGMP content within minutes. Secondarily, treatment of neoplastic cells with a desirable anti-neoplastic compound leads to decreased cAtIP content within 24 hours. The intracellular tarcets of drug actions are being studied further, but current data supports the concept that both the initial rise in cGMP content followed by the subsequent fall in cAMP content precede apoptosis in neoplastic cells exposed to desirable compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The change in the ratio of the two cyclic nucleotides may be a more accurate tool for evaluating desirable PDE5 inhibition activity of test compounds, rather than measuring only the absolute value of cGMP, only PDE5 inhibition, or only the absolute value of cGMP. In neoplastic cells not treated with anti-neoplastic compounds, the ratio of cGMP content/cAMNP content is in the 0.03-0.05 range (i.e., 300-500 fmol/mg protein cGMP content over 6000-8000 fmol/mg protein cAMP content). After exposure to desirable anti-neoplastic compounds, that ratio increases several fold (preferably at least about a three-fold increase) as the result of an initial increase in cyclic GMP and the later decrease in cyclic AMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Specifically, it has been observed that particularly desirable compounds achieve an initial increase in cGMP content in treated neoplastic cells to a level of cGMP greater than about 500 fmol/mg protein. In addition, particularly desirable compounds cause the later decrease in cAMP content in treated neoplastic cells to a level of cAMP less than about 4000 fmol/mg protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To determine the content of cyclic AMP, radioimmunoassay techniques similar to those described above for cGMP are used. Basically, cyclic nucleotides are purified from acid/alcohol extracts of cells using anion-exchange chromatography, dried, acetylated according to published procedures and quantitated using radioimmunoassay procedures. Iodinated ligands of derivatized cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP are incubated with standards or unknowns in the presence of specific antisera and appropriate buffers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Verification of the cyclic nucleotide content may be obtained by determining the turnover or accumulation of cyclic nucleotides in intact cells. To measure inteact cell cAMP, <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-adenine prelabeling is used according to published procedures (Whalin M. E., R. L. Garrett Jr., W. J. Thompson, and S. J. Strada, &ldquo;Correlation of cell-free brain cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities to cyclic AMP decay in intact brain slices&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Sec. Mess. and Phos. Protein Research, </italic></highlight>12:31 1-325, 1989, which is incorporated herein by reference). The procedure measures flux of labeled ATP to cyclic AMP and can be used to estimate intact cell adenylate cyclase or cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities depending upon the specific protocol. Cyclic GMP accumulation was too low to be studied with intact cell prelabeling according to published procedures (Reynolds, P. E., S. J. Strada and W. J. Thompson, &ldquo;Cyclic GMP accumulation in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells measured by intact cell prelabeling,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Life Sci., </italic></highlight>60:909-918, 1997, which is incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> 2.C. Tissue Sample Assay </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The PDE5 inhibitory activity of a test compound can also be determined from a tissue sample. Tissue samples, such as mammalian (preferably rat) liver, are collected from subjects exposed to the test compound. Briefly, a sample of tissue is homogenized in 500 &mgr;l of 6% TCA. A known amount of the homogenate is removed for protein analysis. The remaining homogenate is allowed to sit on ice for 20 minutes to allow for the protein to precipitate. Next, the homogenate is centrifuged for 30 minutes at 15,000 g at 4&deg; C. The supernatant is recovered and the pellet recovered. The supernatant is washed four times with five volumes of water saturated diethyl ether. The upper ether layer is discarded between each wash. The aqueous ether extract is dried in a speed vac. Once dried, the sample can be frozen for future use, or used immediately. The dried extract is dissolved in 500 &mgr;l of assay buffer. The amount of PDE5 inhibition is determined by assaying for the amount of cyclic nucleotides using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), such as the Biotrak EIA system acetylation protocol (available from Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill., USA). Alternatively, RIA procedures as detailed above may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> 2.D. Analyzing Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The amount of inhibition is determined by comparing the activity of PDE5 in the presence and absence of the test compound. Inhibition of PDE5 activity is indicative that the compound is useful for treating neoplasia. Significant inhibitory activity greater than that of the benchmark, exisulind, preferably greater than 50% at a concentration of 10 &mgr;M or below, is indicative that a compound should be further evaluated for antineoplastic properties. Preferably, the IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>value for PDE5 inhibition should be less than 50 &mgr;M for the compound to be further considered for potential use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 3. Determining Whether a Compound Reduces the Number of Tumor Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the screening method of the present invention involves further determining whether the compound reduces the growth of tumor cells. Various cell lines can be used in the sample depending on the tissue to be tested. For example, these cell lines include: SW-480&mdash;colonic adenocarcinoma; HT-29&mdash;colonic adenocarcinoma, A-427&mdash;lung adenocarcinoma carcinoma; MCF-7&mdash;breast adenocarcinoma; and UACC-375&mdash;melanoma line; and DU145&mdash;prostrate carcinoma. Cytotoxicity data obtained using these cell lines are indicative of an inhibitory effect on neoplastic lesions. These cell lines are well characterized. and are used by the United States National Cancer Institute in their screening program for new anti-cancer drugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> 3A. Tumor Inhibition in HT-29 Cell Line </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A compound&apos;s ability to inhibit tumor cell growth can be measured using the HT-29 human colon carcinoma cell line obtained from ATCC (Bethesda, Md.). HT-29 cells have previously been characterized as relevant colon tumor cell culture model (Fogh, J., and Trempe, G. <highlight><italic>In: Human Tumor Cells in Vitro, </italic></highlight>J. Fogh (eds.), Plenum Press, New York, pp. 115-159, 1975). HT-29 cells are maintained in RPMI media supplemented with 5% fetal serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.) and 2 mm glutamine, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at 37&deg; C. Briefly, HT-29 cells are plated at a density of 500 cells/well in 96 well microtiter plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37&deg; C. prior to the addition of compound. Each determination of cell number involved six replicates. After six days in culture, the cells are fixed by the addition of cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% and protein levels are measured using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric protein stain assay as previously described by Skehan, P., Storeng, R., Scudiero, D., Monks, A., McMahon, J., Vistica, D., Warren, J. T., Bokesch, H., Kenney, S., and Boyd, M. R., &ldquo;New Colorimetric Assay For Anticancer-Drug Screening,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Natl. Cancer Inst. </italic></highlight>82: 1107-1112, 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In addition to the SRB assay, a number of other methods are available to measure growth inhibition and could be substituted for the SRB assay. These methods include counting viable cells following trypan blue staining, labeling cells capable of DNA synthesis with BrdU or radiolabeled thymidine, neutral red staining of viable cells, or MTT staining of viable cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> 3.B. Analyzing Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Significant tumor cell growth inhibition greater than about 50% at a dose of 100 &mgr;M or below is further indicative that the compound is useful for treating neoplastic lesions. Preferably, an IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>value is determined and used for comparative purposes. This value is equivalent to the concentration of drug needed to inhibit tumor cell growth by 50% relative to the control. Preferably, the IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>value should be less than 100 &mgr;M for the compound to be considered further for potential use for treating neoplastic lesions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> 4. Determining Whether a Compound Induces Apoptosis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In a second alternate embodiment, the screening method of the present invention further involves determining whether the compound induces apoptosis in cultures of tumor cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Two distinct forms of cell death may be described by morphological and biochemical criteria: necrosis and apoptosis. Necrosis is accompanied by increased permeability of the plasma membrane; the cells swell and the plasma membrane ruptures within minutes. Apoptosis is characterized by membrane blebbing, condensation of cytoplasm and the activation of endogenous endonucleases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Of the two, apoptosis is the most common form of eukaryotic cell death. It occurs naturally during normal tissue turnover and during embryonic development of organs and limbs. Apoptosis also is induced by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells, by ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutic drugs. Inappropriate regulation of apoptosis is thought to play an important role in many pathological conditions including cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer disease, etc. Compounds can be screened for induction of apoptosis using cultures of tumor cells maintained under conditions as described above. Treatment of cells with test compounds involves either pre- or post-confluent cultures and treatment for two to seven days at various concentrations. Apoptotic cells are measured in both the attached and &ldquo;floating&rdquo; compartments of the cultures. Both compartments are collected by removing the supernatant, trypsinizing the attached cells, and combining both preparations following a centrifugation wash step (10 minutes, 2000 rpm). The protocol for treating tumor cell cultures with sulindac and related compounds to obtain a significant amount of apoptosis has been described in the literature. (See, Piazza, G. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>55:3110-16, 1995, which is incorporated herein by reference). The novel features include collecting both floating and attached cells, identification of the optimal treatment times and dose range for observing apoptosis, and identification of optimal cell culture conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> 4.A. Morphological Observation of Apoptosis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Following treatment with a test compound, cultures can be assayed for apoptosis and necrosis by florescent microscopy following labeling with acridine orange and ethidium bromide. The method for measuring apoptotic cell number has previously been described by Duke &amp; Cohen, &ldquo;Morphological And Biochemical Assays Of Apoptosis,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Current Protocols In Immunology</italic></highlight>, Coligan et al., eds., 3.17.1-3.17.16 (1992, which is incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For example, floating and attached cells can be collected by trypsinization and washed three times in PBS. Aliquots of cells can be centrifuged. The pellet can then be resuspended in media and a dye mixture containing acridine orange and ethidium bromide prepared in PBS and mixed gently. The mixture can then be placed on a microscope slide and examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> 4.B. Analysis of Apoptosis by DNA Fragmentation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Apoptosis can also be quantified by measuring an increase in DNA fragmentation in cells which have been treated with test compounds. Commercial photometric EIA for the quantitative in vitro determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated-DNA-fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) are available (Cell Death Detection ELISA<highlight><superscript>okys</superscript></highlight>, Cat. No. 1,774,425, Boehringer Mannheim). The Boehringer Mannheim assay is based on a sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones, respectively. This allows the specific determination of mono-and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasmatic fraction of cell lysates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> According to the vendor, apoptosis is measured in the following fashion. The sample (cell-lysate) is placed into a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate (&ldquo;MTP&rdquo;). Subsequently, a mixture of anti-histone-biotin and anti-DNA peroxidase conjugate are added and incubated for two hours. During the incubation period, the anti-histone antibody binds to the histone-component of the nucleosomes and simultaneously fixes the immunocomplex to the streptavidin-coated MTP via its biotinylation. Additionally, the anti-DNA peroxidase antibody reacts with the DNA component of the nucleosomes. After removal of unbound antibodies by a washing step, the amount of nucleosomes is quantified by the peroxidase retained in the immunocomplex. Peroxidase is determined photometrically with ABTS7 (2,2&prime;-Azido-&lsqb;3 -ethylbenzthiazolin-suffonate&rsqb;)* as substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> For example, SW-480 colon adenocarcinoma cells are plated in a 96-well MTP at a density of 10,000 cells per well. Cells are then treated with test compound, and allowed to incubate for 48 hours at 37&deg; C. After the incubation, the MTP is centrifuged and the supernatant is removed. The cell pellet in each well is then resuspended in lysis buffer for 30 minutes. The lysates are then centrifuged and aliquots of the supernatant (i.e. cytoplasmic fraction) are transferred into streptavidin coated MTP. Care is taken not to shake the lysed pellets (i.e. cell nucleii containing high molecular weight, unfragmented DNA) in the MTP. Samples are then analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Fold stimulation (FS&equals;OD<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/OD<highlight><subscript>veh</subscript></highlight>), an indicator of apoptotic response, is determined for each compound tested at a given concentration. EC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>values may also be determined by evaluating a series of concentrations of the test compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> 4.C. Analyzing Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Statistically significant increases of apoptosis (i.e., greater than 2 fold stimulation at a concentration of 100 &mgr;M) are further indicative that the compound is useful for treating neoplastic lesions. Preferably, the EC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>value for apoptotic activity should be less than 100 &mgr;M for the compound to be further considered for potential use for treating neoplastic lesions. EC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>is herein defined as the concentration that causes 50% induction of apoptosis relative to vehicle treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> 5. Validation&mdash;Mammary Gland Organ Culture Model Tests </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Test compounds identified by the above methods can be tested for antineoplastic activity by their ability to inhibit the incidence of preneoplastic lesions in a mammary gland organ culture system. This mouse mammary gland organ culture technique has been successfully used by other investigators to study the effects of known antineoplastic agents such as NSAIDs, retinoids, tamoxifen, selenium, and certain natural products, and is useful for validation of the screening method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> For example, female BALB/c mice can be treated with a combination of estradiol and progesterone daily, in order to prime the glands to be responsive to hormones in vitro. The animals are sacrificed and thoracic mammary glands are excised aseptically and incubated for ten days in growth media supplemented with insulin, prolactin, hydrocortisone, and aldosterone. DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene) is administered to induce the formation of premalignant lesions. Fully developed glands are then deprived of prolactin, hydrocortisone, and aldosterone, resulting in the regression of the glands but not the premalignant lesions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The test compound is dissolved in DMSO and added to the culture media for the duration of the culture period. At the end of the culture period, the glands were fixed in 10% formalin. stained with alum carmine, and mounted on glass slides. The incidence of forming mammary lesions is the ratio of the glands with mammary lesions and glands without lesions. The incidence of mammary lesions in test compound treated glands is compared with that of the untreated glands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The extent of the area occupied by the mammary lesions can be quantitated by projecting an image of the gland onto a digitation pad. The area covered by the gland is traced on the pad and considered as 100% of the area. The space covered by each of the unregressed structures is also outlined on the digitization pad and quantitated by the computer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Reference compounds and test compounds were analyzed for their COX inhibitory activity in accordance with the protocol for the COX assay of section 1.B. supra. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the effect of various concentrations of either sulindac sulfide or exisulind on purified cyclooxygenase (Type 1) activity. Cyclooxygenase activity was determined using purified cyclooxygenase from ram seminal vesicles as described previously (Mitchell et al, supra). The IC-50 value for sulindac sulfide was calculated to be approximately 1.76 &mgr;M, while that for exisulind was greater than 10,000 &mgr;M. These data show that sulindac sulfide, but not exisulind, is a COX-I inhibitor. Similar data was obtained for the COX-2 isoenzyme. (Thompson, et al., Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 87: 1259-1260, 1995). </paragraph>

The IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>value of exisulind for inhibition of PDE4 was 181 &mgr;M, and for inhibition of PDE5 was 56 &mgr;M. These data show that both sulindac sulfide and exisulind inhibit phospohodiesterase activity. Both compounds show selectivity for the PDE5 isoenzyme form. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The above compounds in Table 2 were evaluated for PDE inhibitory activity, as described in the protocol of section 2.A; supra. Of the compounds that did not inhibit COX, only compound E was found to cause greater than 50% inhibition at 10 &mgr;M. As noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, compound B showed inhibition of greater than 50% at a dose of 20 &mgr;M. Therefore, depending on the dosage level used in a single dose test, some compounds may be screened out that otherwise may be active at slightly higher dosages. The dosage used is subjective and may be lowered after active compounds are found at certain levels to identify even more potent compounds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the inhibition of premalignant lesions in mammary gland organ culture by sulindac metabolites. Mammary gland organ culture experiment were performed as previously described (Mehta and Moon, <highlight><italic>Cancer Research, </italic></highlight>46: 5832-5835, 1986). The results demonstrate that sulindac and exisulind effectively inhibit the formation of premalignant lesions, while sulindac sulfide was inactive. The data support the hypothesis that cyclooxygenase inhibition is not necessary for the anti-neoplastic properties of desired compounds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> To identify compounds that have potential use for treating neoplasia, this invention provides a rationale for comparing experimental data of test compounds from several protocols. Within the framework of this invention, test compounds can be ranked according to their potential use for treating neoplasia in humans. Those compounds having desirable effects may be selected for more expensive and time consuming animal studies that are required to get approval before initiating human clinical trials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Qualitative data of various test compounds and the several protocols are shown in Table 8 below. The data show that exisulind, compound B and compound E exhibit the appropriate activity to pass the screen of four assays: lack of COX inhibition, PDE inhibition, growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. The activity of these compounds in the mammary gland organ culture validates the effectiveness of this invention. The qualitative valuations of the screening protocols rank compound E best, then compound B and then exisulind.
