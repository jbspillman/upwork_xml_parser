<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Polypropylene is a preferred material for use in forming plastic articles. However, a problem with polypropylene is its general surface softness, especially its susceptibility to scratching. Resins having harder surface character are often added to polypropylene to improve its toughness. When these resins are added, however, they are often not found on the surface of the articles formed from the polymer blends. It is desirable to have polyolefin compositions which have good surface hardness and have improved toughness, especially improved scratch resistance. </paragraph>

The polyolefins useful in preparing the polymer blends of the present invention are well-known to those skilled in the art and many are available commercially. Examples of commercially available polyolefins include polypropylene homo- and copolymers such as Himont&apos;s Profax 6523 and 8623, Shell&apos;s 7C54H and 7C06 or Exxon&apos;s PP1012, PD 7132 and PD7163, or Aristech&apos;s 4040F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Processes useful in preparing the propylene ethylene copolymers are well-known to those skilled in the art and many such copolymers are available commercially. Such random copolymers may be prepared by any of a number of methods known in the art including those set forth in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science &amp; Engineering, Vol. 13, 2nd edition, Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 500-et seq.

The reaction product is present in a minor amount. In one embodiment, the reaction product is present in an amount from about 1% up to about 14%, or from about 2% to about 12%, or from about 4% up to about 10% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The polyolefins have been described above. In one embodiment, the number average molecular weight of the polyolefins utilized in this component may range from about 2000 to about 10,000. These polymers typically have a melt flow from about 8 to about 40, or from about 10 to about 35, or from about 15 to about 30 g/10 min. The amount of carboxylic acid reagent reacted with the polyolefin may range from about 0.5% to about 30% or from about 1% to about 20%, or from about 2% to about 15%, or from about 4% to about 10% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic reagent may be mono- or dicarboxylic acid reagent. The carboxylic reagents include carboxylic acids, esters, and salts.

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The reaction between the carboxylic acid reagent in the polyolefin can be effected by means known to those skilled in the art. For example, the reaction can be conducted in solutions by a melt process in the presence of a free radical initiator. The free radical initiators usually are either peroxides or various organic azo compounds. The amount of initiator utilized generally from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight based on the combined weight of the olefin and the carboxylic reagent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An example of acrylated polyolefins are the POLYBOND polymers available from Uniroyal Chemical Company. A particularly useful polymer is POLYBOND 1002, which has a melt flow of 15-25 g/10 min and an acrylic acid content 5.5% to 7.0% by weight. An example of a commercially available maleic acid grafted polypropylene is Epolene E-43 wax from Eastman Chemical Products, Inc.

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The polymer compositions also contain (C) a filler, such as calcium carbonate. The filler is present in a minor amount. The filler is typically present in an amount from 15% to about 50%, or from about 18% to about 45%, or from about 20% to about 40% by weight. Generally, the filler includes mineral powders used in polymer compositions and can include calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide, silica, alumina, mica, etc. A particulary useful filler is treated calcium carbonate sold under the tradename of Supercoat, available from E.C.C. Internation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the polyolefin compositions further comprise (D) at least one copolymer of ethylene and an olefin. Typically, (D) is present in an amount from about 1% to about 8% by weight. The olefin is typically, any of those described above. In one embodiment, the olefin has from 4 to about 10, or from about 6 to about 8 carbon atoms. Examples of the olefins include hexene, heptene, octene, nonene or decene. A preferred ethylene olefin copolymer is an ethylene octene copolymer available commercially from Dow Chemical Co. under the trade name Engage&reg; 8100. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the polyolefin compositions contain (E) at least one polyamide. The polyamide is present in an amount from about 1% up to about 8% by weight. The polyamides include a variety of polyamide resins including semi-crystalline and amorphous or transparent polyamides. These polyamide have been commonly referred to as nylons. The polyamide resins can be produced by condensation of equimolar amounts of a saturated dicarboxylic acid containing from 4 to 12 carbon atoms with a diamine in which the diamine contains from about 4 to about 16 carbon atoms. Alternatively, the dicarboxylic acids utilized to form the nylons may be aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as isophthalic acid or terephthalic acid. Examples of aliphatic saturated dicarboxylic acids include sebacic, octadecanoic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid, undecanedioic acid, glutaric acid, pimelic acid, and especially adipic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Examples of diamines which can be reacted with dicarboxylic acids to form nylons include diamines such as tetramethylenediamine, pentamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, hexadecamethylenediamine, and in particular, hexamethylenediamine. Examples of aromatic amines which can be utilized include para-phenylenediamine and 4,4&prime;-diaminodiphenylsulfone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Polyamide also can be produced by ring-opening polymerization of a cyclic lactam. Excess diamine can be employed to provide an excess of amine end groups over carboxyl end groups in the polyamide. Examples of specific polyamides include polytetramethylene adipamide (nylon 4,6), polyhexamethylene adipamide (nylon 6,6), polyhexamethylene azelamide (nylon 6,9), polyhexamethylene sebacamide (nylon 6,10), polyhexamethylene dodecanoamide (nylon 6,12), the polyamide produced by ring opening of lactams such as polycaprolactam, polybutyrolactam, polypivalolactam, polylauric lactam, poly-11-amino undecanoic acid, bi(par-aminocyclohexyl)methane dodecanoamide, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to utilize polyamides prepared by copolymerization of two or more of the above acids and amines or terpolymerization of the above acids and amines. For example, a suitable polyamide is an adipic acid or isophthalic acid, hexamethylene diamine copolymer. Other copolymers include nylon-6/nylon-66 and nylon-6/nylon-12. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The polyamides which generally have a number average molecular weight of at least about 200 up to about 30,000 although in one embodiment, it is preferred to utilize polyamides having a number average molecular weight of at least 5000. The melting points of the useful polyamides range from about 150&deg; C. to about 280&deg; C. It is preferred to utilize polyamides which are linear polymers with a melting point in excess of about 200&deg; C. In addition to the use of copolymers, the blended polymer compositions of the present invention may also contain a mixture of two or more of the above-described polyamides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Other additives may be included in the polymer composition. For example, stabilizers and inhibitors of oxidative, thermal and ultraviolet light degradation may be included in the polymer blends as well as lubricants and mold release agents, colorants including dyes and pigments, nucleating agents, plasticizers, etc., may be included in the polymer blends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The stabilizers can be incorporated into the composition at any stage in the preparation of the polymer blends, and preferably, the stabilizers are included early to preclude the initiation of degradation before the composition can be protected. The oxidative and thermal stabilizers useful in the polymer blends of the present invention include those used in addition polymers generally. They include, for example, up to about 1% by weight, based on the weight of the polymer blend, of Group l metal halides such as sodium, potassium, lithium and cuprous halides (e.g., chloride, bromide, and iodide), hindered phenols, hydroquinones, and various substituted derivatives of these materials and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The ultraviolet light stabilizers may be included in amounts of up to about 2% by weight based on the weight of the polymer blend. Examples of ultraviolet light stabilizers include various substituted resorcinols, salicylates, benzotriazoles, benzophenones, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Suitable lubricants and mold release agents may be included in amounts of up to about 1% by weight based on the weight of the polymer blend include materials such as stearic acid, stearic alcohol, stearamides, euracamide, organic dies such as nigrosine, pigments such as titanium dioxide, cadmium sulfide, carbon black, etc. The plasticizers which may be included in amounts of up to about 20% by weight based on the weight of the polymer blend include materials such as dioctylphthalate, bibenzylphthalate, butylbenzophthalate, hydrocarbon oils, sulfonamides such as paratoluene ethyl sulfonamides, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The blended polymer compositions of the present invention including (A) the polyolefin, (B) the reaction product of the polyolefin and the alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid reagent, and (C) the calcium carbonate and the other optional additives may be prepared by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For example, a particularly useful procedure is to intimately mix the polymers using conventional mixing equipment such as a mill, a Banbury mixer, a Brabender Torque Rheometer, a single or twin screw extruder, continuous mixers, kneaders, etc. For example, the polymers may be intimately mixed in the form of granules and/or powder in a high shear mixer. One preferred process for preparing the blended polymers utilizes the Farrel Continuous Mixer (FCM CP-23). Short residence times and high shear are readily obtained in a CP-23. &ldquo;Intimate&rdquo; mixing means that the mixture is prepared with sufficient mechanical shear and thermal energy to produce a dispersed phase which is finely divided and homogeneously dispersed in the continuous or principal phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The blended polymer compositions of the present invention may be processed into shaped articles by extrusion, coextrusion, thermoforming, blow-molding, injection-molding, compression-molding, calendering, laminating, stamping, pultrusion, etc. In particular, shaped articles may be prepared by thermoforming sheets of the blended polymer compositions of the present invention.</paragraph>
