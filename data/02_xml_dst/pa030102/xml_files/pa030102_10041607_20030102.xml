<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a focused ion beam (FIB) equipment and a FIB processing method using this equipment, and in particular, to FIB equipment and a FIB processing method using this equipment to perform FIB processing of an LSI device having planarized fine multilayer wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Previous FIB equipment was used to, for example, cut away a prescribed position of an LSI device, to expose a cross-section in order to take scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs. In such applications, the position of the FIB processing extends over a comparatively broad area, and so the precision required for detection of the processing position was not particularly high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in recent years FIB equipment has come to be used to perform partial modification of wiring patterns in LSI devices and other processed samples in an apparatus with high vacuum, by irradiating the wiring pattern with a focused Ga ion beam to perform sputter etching for breaking wiring, or to form new wiring patterns by CVD (using an organometallic gas containing tungsten) to connect wires. In order to thus partially break or connect wiring patterns in finely-structured LSI devices, the processing position must be detected with high precision, and FIB irradiation is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, planarization of multilayer wiring is generally employed in order to realize still more finely-structured LSI devices. In conventional multilayer wiring, problems occur due to wire-break failures caused by decreased coverage of metallization layers and wire breakage due to electromigration at steps, as step heights increase. Hence in recent years, by planarizing the interlaminar insulation layers covering wiring patterns, using chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) methods, and by forming wiring patterns on top, planarization of multilayer wiring structures has been performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is extremely difficult to detect processing positions in such an LSI planarized structure with high precision. In observation of the surface of an LSI device inserted into FIB equipment, the function of a scanning ion microscope (SIM) using the FIB of the equipment is employed, scanning the LSI surface with the beam and detecting the reflected secondary electrons. It is only possible to detect processing positions on the surface by relying on the LSI surface shape detected in this manner. Hence when no depressions or protrusions exist at the processing position, the processing position cannot be identified from a SIM image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It has been proposed that the depressions and protrusions of bonding pads normally provided at the edges of a chip be detected by SIM, and that by moving the stage, targeting the coordinates of the processing position, the processing position be detected; but in this case, a wiring pattern position for processing could not be accurately identified, due to stage errors accompanying stage movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, an image overlay method and a CAD navigation method have been proposed as methods for determining a processing position in FIB processing using conventional FIB equipment. In the image overlay method, an image of the processing position is acquired in advance with an optical microscope; the sample is transported into the FIB equipment; the sample is transported to the processing position coordinates through stage driving; a SIM image there obtained is superposed onto the optical microscope image by adjusting the magnification and rotation; the processing position is detected by relying on the superposed optical microscope image; and FIB processing is performed. The optical microscope can detect not only the surface shape, but the shape of the lower-layer Al wiring pattern also, and so this method is effective for detection of wiring pattern positions in areas where the surface is planarized. In superposing the SIM image and the optical microscope image, images in both corresponding to the depression and protrusions pattern existing on the sample LSI surface are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the CAD navigation method, the stage coordinates of the FIB equipment are linked with the CAD data which is the pattern data of the LSI design data, and by specifying the processing position on the CAD data, the stage automatically moves to the sample processing position. In the above linking process, the CAD data image is superposed onto the SIM image based on bonding pads provided at the edges of the LSI, or on other prescribed patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the above image overlay method, it is necessary that a topmost-layer protrusion/depression pattern exist near the processing position on the LSI surface. Hence when no surface protrusion/depression pattern exists over a broad area, the optical microscope image cannot be superposed on the SIM image in the processing area, and so a processing position cannot be detected within this area. In the CAD navigation method, there occurs position shifts due to stage precision errors accompanying movement of the stage from the positions of bonding pads provided at the chip edges to a processing position in the chip interior, and in such cases it is difficult to accurately detect the processing position. Moreover, in the CAD navigation method also it is ultimately necessary that the SIM image be superposed on the CAD data image based on a protrusion/depression pattern in the vicinity of the processing position, and so accurate detection of the processing position is difficult in a planarized area with few protrusion/depression patterns. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One object of this invention is to provide FIB equipment, and an FIB processing method using same, which can accurately detect an FIB processing position on a planarized sample surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another object of this invention is to provide an LSI device formation method enabling the accurate detection of FIB processing positions in FIB equipment, and an FIB processing method using same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above objects, in a first aspect of this invention, FIB equipment, which irradiates a sample placed on a stage with a focused ion beam (FIB) to perform etching or pattern formation at the irradiation position, comprises an alignment mark formation unit to form an alignment mark by irradiating a periphery of a processing position with the FIB; and a processing position detection unit to superpose an optical microscope image of the area of the processing position at which the alignment mark is formed, and a scanning ion microscope image (SIM image) acquired by FIB irradiation, based on the alignment mark image, and to detect the processing position according to the superposed images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the above FIB equipment, even if the surface of the sample to be processed is planarized, a function of the FIB equipment for etching on pattern formation in extremely small areas can be used to automatically form the alignment mark on the planarized surface. Hence an alignment mark is formed in the area of the processing position, an optical microscope image and SIM image of the area in which the alignment mark is formed are superposed based on the alignment mark, the processing position can be detected with high precision, and such position can be irradiated with an FIB. The alignment mark may be a depression-shape pattern etched by FIB processing, or may be a protrusion-shape pattern formed by FIB processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the above invention is characterized in that, by specifying the processing position and the magnification of the processing area to the automatic alignment mark formation unit, alignment marks are formed in the periphery of the processing position with a size and at an interval which are nearly inversely proportional to the processing magnification. When the processing magnification is low, the shape of the alignment pattern is large, and intervals therebetween are also large; when the processing magnification is high, the alignment pattern shape and intervals therebetween are small in proportion. According to this, alignment marks can be formed on the periphery of the processing area from which a SIM image is acquired, without covering and hiding the pattern for processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, in a second aspect of this invention, alignment marks are formed over an entire surface of a covering insulating layer at an uppermost layer of the sample LSI device for processing, at a size and interval chosen according to a design rule. Processing position detection is performed for this LSI device within the FIB equipment. In the processing position detection, a SIM image of the area including the processing position is superposed with an optical microscope image or CAD image, based on the above alignment marks, the processing position is detected, and the position is irradiated with an FIB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Even if a sample LSI device for processing has a multilayer wiring structure which has been planarized, by forming alignment marks over the entire surface of the silicon oxide film, silicon nitride film, or other insulating cover film which is the uppermost layer, with size and interval chosen according to the design rule, alignment marks can always be made to exist in the vicinity of the processing position. These alignment marks can be formed simultaneously with the process in which etching removal is performed in the bonding pad area of the insulating cover film of the uppermost layer, or can be formed in an additional etching process thereto. To achieve this, the alignment marks data is added to the CAD data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Hence SIM images can be superposed on CAD data images as well as on electron microscope images, relying on the alignment marks. If images can be superposed in the processing area, then the superposed electron microscope image or CAD data image can be used to accurately detect the processing position even when the surface is flat, and FIB irradiation and processing can be performed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Below, preferred embodiments of this invention are explained with reference to the drawings. However, the scope of protection of this invention is not limited to the following embodiments, but extends to the invention described in the scope of claims and to the equivalent of same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an overall schematic diagram of the FIB equipment of an embodiment. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the FIB equipment has a FIB column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which generates the focused ion beam (FIB) and irradiates the surface of the sample for processing with the beam, and a control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprising a computer which controls the FIB column. The FIB equipment of this embodiment also has an optical microscope <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> within, or adjacent to, the FIB column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Within the FIB column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are provided an ion beam gun <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>; a beam blanker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprising a deflector; a focusing lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which focuses the ion beam; a deflector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which deflects the beam to a prescribed position to perform scanning; gas generation means <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to generate gas for use in FIB processing; secondary electron detection means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to detect secondary electrons reflected from the LSI device which is the sample for processing; and a stage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, moveable in the X and Y directions, on which is placed the sample for processing. The stage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can move between an optical microscope <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which uses infrared rays or similar, and the FIB column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Hence an optical microscope image of the sample for processing placed on the stage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be obtained, and in addition a SIM image can be obtained from the secondary electrons reflected upon FIB scanning, similarly to conventional methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is one type of computer system, and the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a CPU or other computation functions. As a result of command signals from the control <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the beam gun driving portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> drives the ion beam gun <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the blanking driving portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> drives the beam blanker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the lens driving portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> drives the focusing lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the deflector driving portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> drives the deflector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The stage driving control portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> also drives the stage driving motor, not shown, according to command signals from the controller. Detection signals from the secondary electron detection means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are input to the secondary electron input portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and supplied to the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, by executing a control program <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, automatically forms alignment marks on the surface of the LSI device for FIB processing, and automatically performs FIB processing at the specified processing position. A settings file <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in which are stored settings, described below, an image data file <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in which are stored optical microscope images and SIM images, and a CAD data file <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in which are stored design data for the LSI device, can be accessed by the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flowchart of the FIB processing method of this embodiment. Below, the FIB equipment of this embodiment, and the FIB processing method using this equipment, are explained referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. First, the LSI device which is the sample for processing is placed on the stage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the FIB equipment (S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a plane view and cross-sectional view showing one example of an LSI device which is the sample for processing. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> is a plane view, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view along line X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; on the surface of the silicon semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are formed an insulating film <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a first wiring layer Al-I, interlaminar insulating films <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, a second wiring layer Al-II, a second interlaminar insulating film <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and a cover insulating film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The first wiring pattern Al-I is formed in the horizontal direction in the plane view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>; the second wiring pattern Al-II is formed in the vertical direction, and these are connected as appropriate through via holes VIA to form the multilayer wiring structure. On the second wiring pattern is formed a third wiring pattern, not shown, and an interlaminar insulating film is formed here also, but the third wiring pattern does not exist in the area of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. After formation of the second wiring pattern, the interlaminar insulating film <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is flattened by a planarization process. Hence if the third wiring pattern is not formed, the surface of the cover film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is planarized, as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> If the surface is planarized, then the SIM image of the area shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> becomes a completely black image, with no changes in the secondary electrons reflected from the surface accompanying FIB irradiation. On the other hand, in the optical microscope image of the area, the wiring patterns below the cover insulating film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can also be detected. However, there are no marks serving as criteria for superposition of the two images, and so superposition is not possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the origin position on the LSI device, placed on the stage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> within the FIB column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is detected based on bonding pads provided at the chip surface by an exposure process of photo-lithography (S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a figure showing the overall chip. In the vicinity of the LSI chip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are provided a plurality of bonding pads <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Of these pads <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, a corner of one pad <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is defined as the chip origin, and this origin <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is detected from an SIM image obtained by FIB scanning. The interrelation between the stage coordinate system and the chip origin is then identified. As a result, stage movement can be employed to move to the processing position <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> within the chip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> When the origin position on the chip is detected, and the interrelation between the stage coordinate system and the chip coordinate system has been identified, FIB processing positions are set (S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and the magnification for observation of the processing area is set (S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) by the operator. These settings are initial settings which are necessary for formation of alignment marks on the periphery of the processing position. The settings data necessary for these settings is stored in the settings data file <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When the above FIB processing position settings and observation magnification settings are made, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> moves the stage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> via the stage driving control portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, to move the processing position <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on the chip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> within the observation area of the FIB column. The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then uses FIB processing to automatically form a pattern of alignment marks determined by the previously set observation magnification (S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>). If the FIB processing employs the CVD method, the alignment marks are a pattern of protrusions formed on the LSI device surface; if the FIB processing employs the sputter etching method, the alignment marks are a pattern of depressions formed in the LSI device surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a figure which explains the automatic formation of alignment marks, formed on the periphery of the processing position within the observed area. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a table showing the relation between the observation magnification and the alignment mark size in automatic formation of alignment marks. The center (X,Y) of the processing position within the chip as set in the above process S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> becomes the center <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the observed area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>; and the size of the alignment marks is defined uniquely by the settings of the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, according to the observation magnification set in the process S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For example, if the observation magnification is set to 100,000 times, then the processing area which is the observation area is set to 24 &mgr;m square, and the size of the alignment marks is set to 2.4 &mgr;m square. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this is accompanied by the formation of a rectangular pattern <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of alignment marks, in the four corners at &plusmn;10 &mgr;m above and below the center <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the observation area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The observation magnification depends on the fineness of the design of the LSI device which is the sample for processing, and corresponds to the design rule. If the device structure is very fine, the observation magnification is also set high; if the device structure is not very fine, the observation magnification is set low. Further, it is preferable that the pattern size of the alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> be set to approximately {fraction (1/10)} the processing area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, which is the observation area. In this way, by setting the observation magnification according to the LSI design rule, a pattern <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of alignment marks can be formed which does not cover the wiring pattern within the observation area which is to be subjected to FIB processing. This is because, if the pattern of alignment marks overlaps with the wiring pattern to be processed, FIB processing becomes difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, if the observation magnification is low (in cases where the design rule is not so fine), the observation area (processing area) is large in size, and consequently the alignment marks are also larger in size. On the other hand, if the observation magnification is high (in cases where the design rule is fine), the observation area (processing area) is small in size, and so the alignment marks are also smaller in size. The sizes of the observation area and alignment marks are substantially in inverse proportion to the observation magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In process S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> moves the stage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> according to the previously set processing position and processing area observation magnification, such that the processing position center <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is positioned within the observation area, and the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then uses the deflector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to deflect the FIB, to form at least three alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in the four corners of the processing area <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a figure showing an LSI device in a state in which alignment marks are formed. Like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a plane view in A, and a cross-sectional view in B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view along the X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As indicated on the right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, protrusion-shaped alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are formed on the flat surface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the LSI device. In the case of such protrusion shapes, by performing FIB irradiation in an organometallic gas atmosphere containing tungsten, such alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> can be formed by CVD. Or, the alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may be depression-shaped, as shown on the left side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. In this case, by performing FIB irradiation in an etching gas atmosphere, the alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are formed by sputter etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the process to form a pattern of alignment marks (S<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) ends, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> moves the stage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so that the LSI device is moved to the side of the optical microscope <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and acquires an optical microscope image (S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The optical microscope <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> acquires an image by, for example, scanning the LSI device with an infrared beam, and detecting the transmitted light with an infrared image pickup element. The image is digitized, put into a form in which enlargement, reduction and rotation are possible, and stores the image in the image data file <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Even if the surface is flat, the optical microscope image can include the surface pattern and the wiring pattern below the cover insulating film <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> drives the stage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to move the LSI device into the FIB column <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such that the processing area center <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is positioned at the center of the FIB column. Then, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> scans the processing area with the FIB, and acquires a SIM image from the reflected secondary electrons (S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). At this time, protrusion-shaped or depression-shaped alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> have been formed on the LSI device surface, so that the SIM image necessarily includes images of the alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. This SIM image is also stored in the image data file <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a figure showing a SIM image and an optical microscope image. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> is a SIM image; alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> have already been formed on the LSI device surface, so that an image of the alignment pattern <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is included in the SIM image obtained by FIB scanning. In an actual SIM image, this alignment pattern <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is perceived as a somewhat indistinct image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> is an optical microscope image. This is an image of the LSI device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and includes an image of the alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> formed on the surface, and an image of the first wiring pattern Al-I and the second wiring pattern Al-II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> At this time enlargement and reduction of the magnification, and modification of the rotation, of the optical microscope image is performed, to adjust the optical microscope image such that superposition on the SIM image is possible (S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). The two images are then superposed, based on the alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). The superposed images may become as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has identified the position of the alignment marks <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in the coordinate system of the FIB equipment, and so by superposing the optical microscope image on the FIB image based on the alignment marks, the position of the wiring pattern in the FIB coordinate system can be easily detected. Finally, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> performs FIB irradiation at the processing position in accordance with the superposed images, in order to perform the required FIB processing (S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). This FIB processing can, according to the processing details, be performed automatically, by creating an appropriate program and causing the processing program to be executed by the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> are figures showing an example of FIB processing. In both figures, A is a plane view, and B is a cross-sectional view along the X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> line. In this example, FIB processing is performed to connect a first wiring pattern Al-I uppermost in the figure with a second wiring pattern Al-I lower in the figure. First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, through sputter etching using FIB irradiation, the insulating films <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are removed, and exposure holes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are formed which expose part of the wiring patterns Al-I. The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> drives the deflector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to irradiate the areas <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with the FIB, forming the exposure holes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. At this time, the FIB irradiation position is detected using the above superposed images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Next, a connecting pattern <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> containing tungsten is formed in the exposure holes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and on the surface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> connecting therebetween, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. That is, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> drives the deflector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to irradiate with an FIB the exposure holes <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the surface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> connecting therebetween, while supplying an organometallic gas for CVD from a gas gun <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so that a connecting pattern <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be formed. This FIB irradiation position is also detected using the above superposed images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Next, the FIB processing method of a second embodiment is explained. In the first embodiment above, the FIB processing functions originally possessed by the FIB equipment were used to form alignment marks in the processing area, and based on this a SIM image acquired by FIB and an optical microscope image were superposed, enabling detection of the processing position in a planarized area of the surface. In the second embodiment, at the end of the LSI device manufacturing process, the cover insulating film is etched to form alignment marks on the entire surface of the chip. Even if planarization technology is adopted in a multilayer wiring structure together with this, because alignment marks with a depressed or protruding shape are formed in the surface in the final process, it is possible to later superpose a FIB image and an optical microscope image, or a CAD data image, for FIB processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a figure showing an example of alignment marks formed on a chip in the second embodiment. In the vicinity of the chip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are formed a plurality of bonding pads PAD. In this embodiment, however, a matrix-shape alignment pattern <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is formed regularly over the entirety of the area inside the bonding pads. It is preferable that the shape of this pattern be rectangular, in order to reduce the amount of CAD data. However, the alignment pattern <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may also be a lattice-shape pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> chip center pattern <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is also formed at the center of the chip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In the CAD data, the pattern data is normally defined with the chip center as the origin. Hence when a chip center pattern <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed, the number of processes performed for moving to the processing position by stage movement can be reduced, because of the same coordinate systems in the CAD data and in the chip. Also, it is preferable that, for example, a cross shape be adopted as the chip center pattern <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for purposes of discrimination from the alignment pattern <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In order to impart versatility, reference patterns <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are also formed on the inside of the pads PAD at the four corners of the chip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, to make the movement to processing positions easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a table showing the relation between the size and interval of alignment marks, and the design rule. The size and placement interval of the alignment pattern <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment are set according to the design rule. As shown in the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, when the design rule is 0.35 &mgr;m (when the minimum pattern size is 0.35 &mgr;m), the size of the alignment pattern <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is set to 3.5 &mgr;m square, and the placement interval between patterns is set to 35 &mgr;m. Hence the patterns <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are formed with approximately 50 minimum-placement patterns formed between neighboring alignment patterns <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. As the design rule is made still finer, the size of the alignment patterns <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is made still smaller, and the placement interval is made narrower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The size and interval of these alignment patterns are determined by an approach similar to that of the first embodiment. That is, if the device structure is not very fine, the size and placement interval of alignment patterns is large; if the device structure is made more fine, the size and placement interval of the alignment patterns are reduced. As a result, alignment patterns <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will reliably exist in the processing area, and moreover the possibility that alignment patterns <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> cover the pattern for processing is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a flowchart of the FIB processing method of the second embodiment. Before explaining this flowchart, the method of manufacture of LSI devices in the second embodiment is explained. At the end of the LSI device manufacture processes, after the cover insulating film has been formed, there is an etching process to remove the cover insulating film on the pad areas. In this embodiment, after this process to etch the pad areas, an exposure process and an etching process are added to form the alignment patterns <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the chip center pattern <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. That is, an exposure mask is used which is formed from CAD data having the alignment patterns <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and chip center pattern <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the resist on the cover insulating film is exposed, and the cover film is partially removed by a prescribed etching process. By this means, a depression-shape pattern shown in the cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, first an optical microscope image of the surface of the LSI device that is the sample for processing is acquired (S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). This image data is stored in storage means and saved. Next, the LSI device which is the sample for processing is transported into the FIB equipment, and placed on the stage <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). Then the optical microscope image data is transferred to the control unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the FIB equipment, and stored in an image data file <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>). This data transfer may also be performed before the LSI device transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then drives the stage, and moves from the chip center pattern <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the LSI device to the processing position (S<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>). In this movement, because a chip center pattern <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has been formed in advance at the center of the LSI chip, the chip center pattern <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be identified from a SIM image acquired by FIB scanning. Hence using CAD data defined in terms of the chip center, stage movement to the processing position coordinates can be performed using few processes. When moving the stage based on the positions of pads on the chip periphery, it is necessary to first convert the coordinates of the CAD data, which take the chip center as the origin, into a new coordinate system with a pad position as the origin, and so processes become complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Then, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> performs FIB scanning and detects reflected secondary electrons to acquire a SIM image of the processing area, including the processing position (S<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>). The magnification and rotation of the previously acquired optical microscope image are then adjusted such that there is agreement with the SIM image (S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). With this, the SIM image and the optical microscope image both become images containing alignment patterns, similarly to the case shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Hence the two images can easily be superposed, based on the alignment pattern (S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Finally, the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> identifies the FIB processing position according to the superposed images, and can break or connect a wiring pattern (S<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) by performing FIB irradiation at this position. The method of connection of wiring patterns is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Breaking a wiring pattern is possible by performing FIB irradiation and introducing etching gas, so that sputter etching of only the FIB-irradiated area is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the second embodiment, CAD data is used to form alignment patterns on the surface of the LSI pattern. Hence in order to identify the FIB processing position, superposition of a CAD data image and a SIM image is also possible. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, process S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is executed in place of process S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and processes S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are executed in place of processes S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Registration mark patterns also exist in the CAD data, and so superposition of a CAD data image and an FIB image is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A prior art example related to the second embodiment is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. H5-90370. In this prior art example is described the formation of a lattice-shape depression/protrusion pattern for alignment on the chip surface, and detection of a position for FIB processing based on this. However, there is no description of the setting of the size and interval of the depression/protrusion pattern for alignment according to the design rule. Further, there is no description of the superposition of an optical microscope image or CAD data image with an FIB image based on this depression/protrusion pattern for alignment, or of detection of a processing position based on the superposed images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As has been described, in the second embodiment, merely by adding a process in which, in the final manufacturing process, alignment mark patterns are formed on an LSI surface which has been planarized, in the subsequent FIB processing, the processing position can easily be detected. FIB processing is generally used not with mass-produced items, but with trial items and other devices to change part of the circuit; addition of the manufacturing process in question is mainly necessary for trial items, and does not result in increased costs for mass-produced items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Thus by means of this invention, detection of a processing position can be performed with high precision even for LSI devices and other processing samples with a planarized surface, enabling FIB processing of fine patterns. </paragraph>
