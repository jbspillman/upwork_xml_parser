<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In more detail, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as a sectional view taken along the line A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as a development view of the drum, the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the clothes drier is constructed with a cylindrical body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the plurality of baffles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> projected from the inner circumference of the cylindrical body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at regular intervals toward the center of the rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the general clothes drier, the plurality of baffles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are lengthily formed along the length direction of the cylindrical body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, herein three bafflers project from the inner circumference of the cylindrical body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> at an angle of 120&deg; in a normal direction of the cylindrical body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> When the cylindrical body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is rotated, the clothes drier including the plurality of baffles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> moves and lifts the clothes inside the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the upper portion of the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, when the baffles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which the clothes are hanging on are moved to the upper portion of the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the clothes drop freely from the upper portion to the bottom portion of the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the clothes are dried by contacting to heating air sucked through the suction port <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the rear plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while dropping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> However, in the conventional clothes drier, because a length of the plurality of baffles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are same with a length of the cylindrical body <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, it is difficult to disperse the clothes regularly, accordingly the clothes are gathered around one place or are messed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the clothes are gathered around one place of the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or are messed, drying of the clothes may not be performed well, lots of time is required for drying the clothes, accordingly a clothes drying efficiency is sharply lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Particularly, the clothes may be gathered around the exhaust port <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the front plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by flow of heating air. In more detail, when the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rotated, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, heating air sucked into the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the suction port <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> flows into the upper portion of the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is exhausted through the exhaust port <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, herein the clothes lifted up to the upper portion of the drum <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by the baffles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> drop freely and are gathered around the exhaust port <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by the flow of the air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the clothes are gathered around the exhaust port <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, because it increases a flow friction of the air exhausted through the exhaust port <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a load and a noise of the fan <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are increased, in addition because a drying efficiency is lowered due to the decrease of air flow rate, a time required for drying the clothes is increased. </paragraph>
