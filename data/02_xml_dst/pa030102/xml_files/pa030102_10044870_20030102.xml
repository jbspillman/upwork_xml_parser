<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates to a plate heat exchanger and its method of construction. A pair of round corrugated heat transfer plates provide a cassette with the corrugations of one heat exchanger plate angled relative to the other so as to form angular channels for fluid flow of a primary fluid and a secondary fluid. A plurality of the corrugated cassettes are contained within a housing and are provided with a pair of port holes. The housing is in the form of a cylindrical shell and includes a bottom cover member and a top cover member. The cylindrical shell has an inlet nozzle and an outlet nozzle on opposed sides of the shell for the secondary fluid while the top cover member is provided with an inlet nozzle and an outlet nozzle for a primary fluid. The nozzles of the top cover member are aligned with port holes formed in each of the cassettes. Depending on the type of use, either the portholes or the cassette outer edge may be welded, with gaskets used alternately on the fouling side(s). A gasketed or semi-gasketed heat exchanger allows the unit to be cleaned on the gasketed side of the unit when fouling is a concern. A spring device is provided on the bottom of the housing to compensate for any mechanical or thermal expansion of the cassettes that may occur during operation of the heat exchanger. Also, a special seal is provided for preventing short-circuiting of the fluid as it passes through the heat exchanger. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a heat exchanger for exchanging heat between two fluids. The heat exchanger comprises a pack of corrugated heat transfer plates which are provided with inlet and outlet ports for a primary fluid that lead to channels formed by the corrugations in the plates for fluid flow therethrough. The heat transfer plates are paired together so as to provide for separate inlet and outlet channels for the fluid flow of primary and secondary fluids within the heat exchanger cylindrical housing. The secondary fluid communicates in direct heat transfer by flowing through channels around the primary fluid inlet and outlet ports, whereas the primary fluid communicates in indirect heat transfer by flowing through alternate channels and between the inlet and outlet ports. Gaskets or welding provide the sealing methods necessary to contain and separate the primary and secondary fluids. A spring device is provided at the bottom of the heat exchanger housing to compensate for any expansion of the heat transfer plates along the longitudinal axis of the housing. In addition, seal means are provided within the housing for preventing short circuiting of the secondary fluid as it flows through the heat exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Depending on the type of service, the invention may be configured with gaskets and/or welding in one of the four different configurations. For example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (a) a semi-welded heat exchanger with gaskets sealing the port areas of the plates, and welds sealing the plate perimeter; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (b) an all gasketed heat exchanger with gaskets sealing the port areas and the plate perimeter; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (c) a semi-welded heat exchanger in which welds are used to seal the port areas between plate channels, and gaskets are used to seal the plate perimeter; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (d) an all-welded heat exchanger in which welds are used to seal the port areas between plate channels, and welds are likewise used to seal the plate perimeter.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawing and more particularly <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, the external features are shown of one version of a heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made in accordance with the present invention. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a series of cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> enclosed within a housing comprising a cylindrical shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> the upper portion of which is closed by a circular top cover member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the lower portion of which is closed by a circular bottom cover member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The top cover member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes an inlet nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> adapted to receive primary fluid at a predetermined temperature. The primary fluid flows in the direction of the arrow &ldquo;A&rdquo; entering the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the inlet nozzle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and then into an inlet port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed in each of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The primary fluid then flows through alternating channels or passages (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) and through an outlet port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed in each of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and finally exits though an outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> secured to the top cover member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the secondary fluid flows in the direction of the arrows &ldquo;B&rdquo; entering the shell side of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through a shell side inlet nozzle <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and exists through a shell side outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The secondary fluid flows into a circular area surrounding the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is divided by a pair of metal identical seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into a secondary fluid inlet chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a secondary fluid outlet chamber <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, are positioned along an axis which is substantially normal to an axis passing through the longitudinal centers of the nozzles <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The secondary fluid initially flows into the arcuate inlet chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> formed by the pair of diametrically opposed seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. The seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> force the secondary fluid to flow from chamber <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through alternate channels or passages located in each of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into chamber <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, each of the channels through which the secondary fluid flows are located between the channels provided for the primary fluid. The secondary fluid flows in the direction of arrows &ldquo;B&rdquo; around the ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and into the chamber <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and then exits the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the outlet nozzle <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As should be apparent, the seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> prevent short circuit flow between the inlet and outlet shell side nozzles <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> At this juncture, it will be noted that the top and bottom cover members <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are joined to the cylindrical shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by welding or other convenient means that would prevent leakage of internal fluids to the external surroundings. Similarly, the primary fluid inlet and outlet port nozzles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are joined to the top cover member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by welds, and the secondary fluid inlet and outlet nozzles <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are joined by welds to the cylindrical shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, each cassette <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> consists of a pair of heat transfer (&ldquo;HT&rdquo;) plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>One of the HT plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> having the configuration it assumes prior to having the holes required for inlet port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the outlet port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed therein. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the HT plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a plurality of generally &ldquo;V&rdquo; shaped and parallel channels formed therein each of which has inner and outer ridges each identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that the HT plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is identical in configuration to the HT plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. After a pair of the HT plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed and holes for the inlet and outlet ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are provided in each of the plates, one of the HT plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is rotated 180 degrees and turned over so that one of the plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is superimposed upon the other. This causes the channels of each of the plates to cross each other at a fixed angle as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> wherein several of the channels of the HT plate <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are shown in phantom lines. After the HT plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are superimposed in this manner, the two plates form a cassette <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having passages therein formed by the inner ridges of the channels. The HT plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are then connected to each other by providing a circular weld <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> just outside of each of the inlet and outlet ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The weld <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provides a seal between the two plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>around each of the associated ports. Afterwards, two of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are stacked on top of each other and attached to each other by providing a seal in the form of a continuous weld <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> adjacent the outside perimeter of the two inner plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Another cassette <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is then placed on top of the two-cassette packet and similarly attached to each other. This continues until the desired number of cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are joined to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> After the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are connected to each other as explained above, a flat round plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) without port holes is attached to the bottom of the cassette pack by a weld which forms a seal along the outer perimeter of the plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This is followed by similarly welding a flat round plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to the top of the cassette pack. In this regard, it will be noted that the plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided with round holes which register with the inlet and outlet ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A disk <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having circular corrugations, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, is then attached at its center by a weld to the bottom surface of plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Afterwards, the seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are fixedly attached to the edges of the cassette pack. Once this core portion of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fabricated, it is placed within the heat exchanger housing as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. During use of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the disk <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> serves as a spring device to compensate for any vertical expansion of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that may occur during the operation of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the disk <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is made of spring steel and is seated against the bottom cover member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so as to assist with plate pack thermal expansion by absorbing axial plate pack movement along the perpendicular direction to the bottom cover member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In other words, the disk <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> acts as a bellows or spring, and allows the plate pack to expand towards and away from the bottom cover member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This arrangement reduces fatigue stresses that would otherwise occur if the plates of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> were forced to remain in place during periods of temperature fluctuations and associated thermal expansions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, each of the seals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is made of metal and comprises a metal bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a pair of identical metal clips <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has one edge thereof provided with uniformly vertically spaced contoured projections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Each of the projections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has the same shape as the spaces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> that are located adjacent the periphery of each of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The projections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> fit tightly into the outer peripheral spaces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> between the HT plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the stacked cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The metal clips <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are made of spring steel and are welded to the plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to assist in sealing the chambers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from each other and in holding the bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in place. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the clips <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are &ldquo;J&rdquo; shaped in cross section and, although not shown, extend vertically the length of the cassette stack between the plates <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A curved portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of each of the clips <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> continually biases the inner curved surface of the shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and together with the bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> provides the seal between the chambers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> show another version of the heat exchanger made according to the present invention. It will be understood that the parts of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that are essentially identical to those parts of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are identified by the same reference numerals but primed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> shown includes a plurality of HT plates having certain structural similarities to the HT plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>In this instance, however, the HT plates of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are stacked one over the other and have elastomeric circular O-ring type gaskets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> located between such HT plates to provide for vertically spaced channels through which the primary and secondary fluids can flow. As with the HT plates <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the HT plates of this heat exchanger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are arranged so that the channels of adjacent HT plates cross each other. Moreover, rather than providing a weld around the port holes to join a pair of adjacent HT plates and providing a weld at the perimeter to join adjacent cassettes as in the case of heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the sealing of the HT plates of this heat exchanger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is provided by the gaskets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of an individual HT plate. Thus, a circular gasket <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the form of an O-ring is located within a circular depression or track <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> surrounding each of the inlet and outlet ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime;. Accordingly, rather than have a weld such as weld <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> around the inlet and outlet ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the O-ring <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> serves the same purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Similarly, rather than have the weld <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for joining two adjacent cassettes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the enlarged O-ring type seal <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is located in a circular depression or track <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> located adjacent to the outer peripheral edge of each of the HT plates of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In this manner the primary fluid indicated by the arrows A&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is separated from the secondary fluid indicated by the arrows B&prime;. It will be understood that one or the other of the gaskets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be eliminated and substituted by a weld so as to provide a semi-welded heat exchanger rather than a fully gasketed heat exchanger as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Also note that the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided with diametrically opposed identical seals for preventing direct fluid flow between the nozzles <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&prime;. The seals, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, take the form of an elastomeric pad <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> contoured with projections (not shown) to fit into the spaces between the HT plates in the manner of the bar <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> provided in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Each of the pads <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is held securely in place by compression imparted by a metal support bar <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having a cross-sectional curved shape corresponding to the curvature of the inner side of the shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of the HT plates in the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is ideal when there are two fouling fluids in service and when it is desirable to clean the entire unit. Also note that during HT plate pack assembly, there is a possibility that, unless held in their accommodating tracks, the gaskets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> could fall or slip out of place. To this end, an adhesive is used, that can be easily cleaned off and removed, to attach the gaskets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> into their respective depressions or tracks. Once compressed by the HT plates, the gaskets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> form a tight seal between channels that is independent of the adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference> show another version of a heat exchanger shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that, in this instance, the parts of this heat exchanger <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference> that are essentially the same as those parts shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be identified by the same reference numerals but double primed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>, a cylindrical shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&Prime; with bottom cover member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime; forms the welded portion of the housing assembly. At the upper end of the shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&Prime;, a ring type flange <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is fixedly secured by a weld to the shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&Prime;. The flange <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of circumferentially equally spaced holes <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which register with corresponding holes <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> formed in a round top cover member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. A circular gasket <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided to affect the seal between top member <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and the bolting illustrated is provided by threaded studs <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and nuts <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. This alternative shell assembly arrangement seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> enables the HT plate pack to be removed from the housing for disassembly and cleaning without the need to remove and subsequently replace welds as is the case with the cylindrical shell <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the top cover member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in the all welded design of the heat exchanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The top round plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&Prime; provides a flat surface to which the inlet and outlet port nozzles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>&Prime; can be attached by welding or other convenient means. The bottom round plate <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&Prime; provides a rigid surface for support of the plate pack against point loads that might be imposed by the disk <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Various modifications and changes can be made to the heat exchanger constructions without departing from the spirit of the invention. Such changes and modifications are contemplated by the inventor and he does not wish to be limited except by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
