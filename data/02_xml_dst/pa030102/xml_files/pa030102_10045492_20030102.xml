<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally regards the coating of work-pieces. More particularly, the present invention regards a method and system for precision coating implantable medical appliances using a solenoid type fluid dispensing head. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The positioning and deployment of medical appliances within a target site of a patient is a common, often-repeated procedure of contemporary medicine. These appliances or implants are used for innumerable medical purposes including the reinforcement of recently re-enlarged lumens and the replacement of ruptured vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Coatings are often applied to these medical appliances to increase their effectiveness. These coatings may provide a number of benefits including reducing the trauma suffered during the insertion procedure, facilitating the acceptance of the medical appliance into the target site, and improving the post-procedure effectiveness of the appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Expandable stents, stent grafts, balloon delivery systems, and aneurism coils are specific examples of medical appliances or implants that may be coated and inserted within the body. Expandable stents are tube-like medical appliances that often have a mesh-like structure designed to support the inner walls of a lumen. These stents are typically positioned within a lumen and, then, expanded to provide internal support for it. Because of the direct contact of the stent with the inner walls of the lumen, stents have been coated with various compounds and therapeutics to enhance their effectiveness. When this coating is haphazardly applied or has somehow been removed during the stent&apos;s manufacture or delivery, the stent&apos;s effectiveness can be compromised. In certain circumstances, defective implanted stents must be removed and reinserted through a second medical procedure&mdash;an unwanted result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Indiscriminate coating methods such as dip-coating and spray-coating have been used to coat stents as well as other medical appliances. These methods are, however, both wasteful and difficult to control. For example, dipping can result in non-uniform application of the coating to the appliance, thereby placing more coating at one end or region of the stent and making it difficult to predict the dosage of therapeutic that will be delivered when the stent or other appliance is implanted. The indiscriminate nature of dipping is also problematic as it may lead to the cracking and crumbling of coating at the junctions, hinges, and flexing members of the mesh-like stents. The coating that covers the hinged portions of the stent is highly susceptible to exfoliate because, as the stent is expanded, intolerable stresses may develop within the coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are illustrative of some of the concerns stemming from an indiscriminate coating process like dipping. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is shown in a closed, pre-deployment state. Here, stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has been previously dipped in a vat of therapeutic in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In other words, the right side of stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> was the leading edge entering the dipping vat. As can be seen, the coating of stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is heavier on the right side than on the left side and covers each of the junctions <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> throughout the entire stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As can also be seen, the coating becomes progressively thicker and covers more of the space between each of struts <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as you travel from the left side to the right side of stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This increasing thickness of coating is indicative of a stent that has been dipped and let stand on one of its ends as the coating dries and adheres to the stent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the unevenly coated stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in an expanded state as it may be after it is positioned within a body. As is evident, the expansion of stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has led to the cracking and crumbling of coating <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Also evident is that the coating has been removed from most if not all of the junction points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> after stent <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has been expanded. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a system for coating a medical appliance using a solenoid type fluid dispensing head in accord with one embodiment of the present invention. In this system, solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be used to force coating onto the patterned surfaces of medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be placed in close proximity to medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and may be moved back and forth along track <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> so that it may be able to coat the entire external patterned surface of medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be controlled by, or at least receive signals from, processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which may instruct it to coat only struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> of medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In other words, as solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> slides back and forth along track <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and as medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is spun on appliance support <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may force coating onto struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> while concurrently refraining from forcing coating into spaces between struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, because coating forced into these spaces would simply be wasted or result in errant deposits of coating elsewhere on medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> has already been coated, while another portion of struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> has not been coated. Also apparent in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is that junctions <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> of struts <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> have not been coated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also illustrates stream of coating <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> ejected from solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> prior to contact with medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the coating source <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and may be used to supply coating to solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Storage media <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be in communication with processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and may be used to store and provide instructions for processor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and coating source <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for coating medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Storage media <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be one of numerous types of available storage media including both volatile (i.e. RAM) and non-volatile storage devices (i.e. ROM, CD ROM, EEPROM, Magnetic Media, etc.). The pre-programmed instructions or other retained data may be unique to each medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and may account for the unique external pattern and precise dimensions of each medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that may be coated by solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Storage media <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may also hold unique instruction sets for many different medical appliances or may be provided with a media receptacle such as a disk drive that accommodates different recordable media, each recordable media holding a unique instruction set for a single medical appliance or a set of instructions for multiple medical appliances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in this embodiment may be rotated by appliance support <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in order to expose different sides of medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Consequently, through the coordinated movement of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on track <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in appliance support <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, all external portions of medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be exposed to and coated by the nozzle (not shown) of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, wherein the medical appliance is flat or otherwise linear, the appliance support configuration may be different than that described above. Here, the appliance support may provide for movement of the appliance in both the x and y planes while the solenoid type fluid dispensing head moves back and forth overhead in order to reach the entire surface of the medical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As described above, solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with coating source <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Coating source <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may contain any one of several possible coatings to be placed on medical appliance <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. These coatings may include paclitaxel, a polymer with a suspended therapeutic, a non-thrombogenic agent, a lubricious material, a non-slippery material, a radiopaque agent, a radioactive agent, and a magnetic signature agent. These coatings may also include: pharmaceutically active compounds, proteins, cells, oligonucleotides, ribozymes, anti-sense oligonucleotides, DNA compacting agents, gene/vector systems (i.e., any vehicle that allows for the uptake and expression of nucleic acids), nucleic acids (including, for example, recombinant nucleic acids; naked DNA, cDNA, RNA; genomic DNA, cDNA or RNA in a non-infectious vector or in a viral vector and which further may have attached peptide targeting sequences; antisense nucleic acid (RNA or DNA); and DNA chimeras which include gene sequences and encoding for ferry proteins such as membrane translocating sequences (&ldquo;MTS&rdquo;) and herpes simplex virus-1 (&ldquo;VP22&rdquo;)), and viral, liposomes and cationic and anionic polymers and neutral polymers that are selected from a number of types depending on the desired application. Non-limiting examples of virus vectors or vectors derived from viral sources include adenoviral vectors, herpes simplex vectors, papilloma vectors, adeno-associated vectors, retroviral vectors, and the like. Non-limiting examples of biologically active solutes include anti-thrombogenic agents such as heparin, heparin derivatives, urokinase, and PPACK (dextrophenylalanine proline arginine chloromethylketone); antioxidants such as probucol and retinoic acid; angiogenic and anti-angiogenic agents and factors; agents blocking smooth muscle cell proliferation such as rapamycin, angiopeptin, and monoclonal antibodies capable of blocking smooth muscle cell proliferation; anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone, prednisolone, corticosterone, budesonide, estrogen, sulfasalazine, acetyl salicylic acid, and mesalamine; calcium entry blockers such as verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine; antineoplastic/antiproliferative/anti-mitotic agents such as paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, cyclosporine, cisplatin, vinblastine, vincristine, epothilones, endostatin, angiostatin and thymidine kinase inhibitors; antimicrobials such as triclosan, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and nitorfurantoin; anesthetic agents such as lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine; nitric oxide (NO) donors such as lisidomine, molsidomine, L-arginine, NO-protein adducts, NO-carbohydrate adducts, polymeric or oligomeric NO adducts; anti-coagulants such as D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone, an RGD peptide-containing compound, heparin, antithrombin compounds, platelet receptor antagonists, anti-thrombin antibodies, anti-platelet receptor antibodies, enoxaparin, hirudin, Warafin sodium, Dicumarol, aspirin, prostaglandin inhibitors, platelet inhibitors and tick antiplatelet factors; vascular cell growth promotors such as growth factors, growth factor receptor antagonists, transcriptional activators, and translational promotors; vascular cell growth inhibitors such as growth factor inhibitors, growth factor receptor antagonists, transcriptional repressors, translational repressors, replication inhibitors, inhibitory antibodies, antibodies directed against growth factors, bifunctional molecules consisting of a growth factor and a cytotoxin, bifunctional molecules consisting of an antibody and a cytotoxin; cholesterol-lowering agents; vasodilating agents; agents which interfere with endogeneus vascoactive mechanisms; survival genes which protect against cell death, such as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family factors and Akt kinase; and combinations thereof. Cells may be of human origin (autologous or allogenic) or from an animal source (xenogeneic), genetically engineered if desired. The delivery medium is formulated as needed to maintain cell function and viability. Any modifications are routinely made by one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotide sequences useful in practice of the invention include DNA or RNA sequences having a therapeutic effect after being taken up by a cell. Examples of therapeutic polynucleotides include anti-sense DNA and RNA; DNA coding for an anti-sense RNA; or DNA coding for tRNA or rRNA to replace defective or deficient endogenous molecules. The polynucleotides of the invention may also code for therapeutic proteins or polypeptides. A polypeptide is understood to be any translation product of a polynucleotide regardless of size, and whether glycosylated or not. Therapeutic proteins and polypeptides include as a primary example, those proteins or polypeptides that can compensate for defective or deficient species in an animal, or those that act through toxic effects to limit or remove harmful cells from the body. In addition, the polypeptides or proteins that may be injected, or whose DNA may be incorporated, include without limitation, angiogenic factors and other molecules competent to induce angiogenesis, including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, hif-1, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor &agr; and &bgr;, platelet-derived endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor &agr;, hepatocyte growth factor and insulin like growth factor; growth factors; cell cycle inhibitors including CDK inhibitors; anti-restenosis agents, including p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27, p53, p57, Rb, nFkB and E2F decoys, thymidine kinase (&ldquo;TK&rdquo;) and combinations thereof and other agents useful for interfering with cell proliferation, including agents for treating malignancies; and combinations thereof Still other useful factors, which may be provided as polypeptides or as DNA encoding these polypeptides, include monocyte chemoattractant protein (&ldquo;MCP-1&rdquo;), and the family of bone morphogenic proteins (&ldquo;BMP&apos;s&rdquo;). The known proteins include BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6 (Vgr-1), BMP-7 (OP-1), BMP-8, BMP-9, BMP-10, BMP-11, BMP-12, BMP-13, BMP-14, BMP-15, and BMP-16. Currently preferred BMP&apos;s are any of BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6 and BMP-7. These dimeric proteins may be provided as homodimers, heterodimers, or combinations thereof, alone or together with other molecules. Alternatively or, in addition, molecules capable of inducing an upstream or downstream effect of a BMP may be provided. Such molecules include any of the &ldquo;hedgehog&rdquo; proteins, or the DNA&apos;s encoding them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Another alternative coating material is any conductive material, which may be coated on the medical appliance to provide electrical conductivity for either power or signal functions to different parts of the medical appliance. For instance, an electrically conductive stripe may be applied to a catheter to enable a source of power at a proximal end of the catheter to provide power to a remote application at a distal end of the catheter. Additionally, the solenoid type fluid dispensing head may be utilized to coat a previously applied conductive material with an insulating material to thereby electrically isolate the conductive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A solenoid type fluid dispensing head may enable coating with more viscous materials than alternative methods because it may have a larger orifice and nozzle through which the coating fluids travel. Solenoid type fluid dispensing heads may enable coating with materials having viscosities from 1 centipoise (viscosity equal to water) to 1500 centipoise. Higher viscosities may also be possible using higher pressures for the coating source. An exemplary pressure for the coating source is 30 pounds per square inch above atmospheric pressure. Highly viscous materials may be preferable for coating medical appliances. Coating materials may become viscous due to a high solids content, which may be due to a higher concentration of therapeutic. A higher concentration of therapeutic may be preferable from a clinical standpoint in that it may make the medical appliance more effective. Additionally, coatings having high concentrations of therapeutic (and therefore high viscosity) may require fewer coating steps, and therefore require less time to produce. Therefore, higher drug loads may be applied to the medical appliance with fewer coats which may be applied in less time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The solenoid type fluid dispensing head in this embodiment is preferably programmed to coat in a precise manner, allowing coating to be applied in a complex pattern, matching the complex pattern of the medical appliance. It may also be preferred that the stream of coating forced from the solenoid type fluid dispensing head be small in relation to the target area of the medical appliance to allow for a high degree of precision in coating the target. Precision coating of the medical appliance enables economical use of coating materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, rather than having the coating material deposited in one coat or layer around the entire device, the solenoid type fluid dispensing head may coat the medical appliance with different layers of different thicknesses in different regions of the appliance as may be desirable for the subsequent use of the appliance. In doing so, different concentrations of therapeutic may be deposited in different regions of the medical appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The coatings that may be applied by a solenoid type fluid dispensing head may also include: lubricious coatings to reduce the stress exerted on the stent during the stent&apos;s deployment; radiopaque coatings for identifying the location of stents after implantation using traditional radiography techniques; radioactive agents that are useful in preventing tissue regrowth in and around implanted stents; and magnetic coatings that enable identification of the location of the implanted stent using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques. These magnetic coatings may be obtained using ferritic powders or paramagnetic powders such as Gadolinium or Disprosium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Another useful application of this precise coating method may be to convey information, or an identification code on the appliance itself. This information or code may then be used to identify the source of the medical appliance and other history related to it for tracking purposes. Once implanted, the code, which may be a bar code, could be read though radiography, MRI or any other suitable invasive or non-invasive procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a system for coating a medical appliance using a solenoid type fluid dispensing head and means for redirecting the material forced from the solenoid type fluid dispensing head prior to impacting the targeted medical appliance in accord with an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment the solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be used to coat a medical appliance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as described above. However, in this embodiment, after coating stream <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has been forced from solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, it may be redirected or influenced by redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be implemented using a battery or power source controlled by processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to apply a voltage between nozzle <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and appliance support <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Alternative methods for influencing the path or trajectory of the coating once it has been forced from solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may also be possible. By employing redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the distance that the head may travel may be reduced. Similarly, the head may not need to be moved back and forth as quickly as in earlier embodiments as the gross adjustments may be completed with the movement of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> along a track (not shown) while the fine adjustments of the forced coating may be controlled by redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be controlled by processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which may also control appliance support <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Here, solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, working in concert with appliance support <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which may hold, move, and rotate the medical appliance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, may coat each of the struts <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> but not the junctions <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be mounted so that coating stream <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> forced from solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> receives a positive or negative charge from nozzle <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> which is connected to redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. An opposite charge is applied by redirecting means <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to the struts of medical appliance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through appliance support <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Coating stream <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, having an opposite charge, would therefore be attracted to the struts of medical appliance <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention wherein solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with coating source <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is arranged above medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which is arranged on appliance support <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is adjustable up and down by nozzle height adjustment <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to increase or decrease the distance between solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In one exemplary embodiment, the distance between solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may depend on both the diameter of the nozzle (not shown) of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the viscosity of the fluid being applied to medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. An exemplary range of values for the diameter of the nozzle is from 1 micron to 5 millimeters. Solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may also move in the direction of the longitudinal axis of medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> during the coating process at the command of the processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is vision system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which is a microvision system or micro-tracking vision system. Vision system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> communicates with a processor (not shown) to control the movements of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the rotation of medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the ejection of material from solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Vision system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be used in any one of, or any combination of, the following ways. First, vision system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be used to determine the position and orientation of medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by identifying an identifiable feature on medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Second, vision system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be used to determine the position and orientation of the nozzle of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by observing the solenoid type fluid dispensing head directly or by observing a test coating ejected onto a test piece for the purpose of locating solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Finally, vision system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be used to monitor the coating of medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> as the coating is proceeding. </paragraph>

X-y positioning table <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is used to position medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> prior to, or during, the coating process. The x-y plane is defined as the plane perpendicular to the direction of the nozzle (not shown) of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. X-y positioning table may be either manually controlled or processor controlled. Mandrel <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> holds medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a stent, in a weak friction fit. Mandrel <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in an exemplary embodiment is stainless steel with a teflon coating to prevent accumulation of any excess coating and to facilitate cleaning of mandrel <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Additionally, mandrel <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> may be painted black to improve contrast between mandrel <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and medical appliance <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and to thereby improve the quality of the image collected by vision system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is shown in valve mounting clamp <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is vision system <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which operates, as noted above, to observe the deposition of the coating onto medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as well as to perform numerous other functions including verifying the position of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, vision system <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be used for quality control, for orienting medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with respect to solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and for tracking the external pattern of medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> during the coating process. Therefore, the processor may use information received from vision system <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to adjust the commands it issues to solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> during the coating process. Also illustrated in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is appliance support <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, which includes mandrel <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, holding in this exemplary embodiment a stent as medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The position of mandrel <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is adjustable by appliance support <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> in response to the processor using data collected by vision system <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Mandrel <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is rotatable before and during the coating process to bring all exposed surfaces of medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> adjacent to solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. When an exposed surface of medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that requires coating is adjacent to the solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is activated by the processor to open and allow the coating material, which is under pressure, to flow through solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and through nozzle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> onto medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Nozzle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is adapted to provide maximum control over the coating material to allow accurate coating of medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The design of nozzle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may vary depending on the viscosity of the coating material. Alternatively, two solenoid type fluid dispensing heads may be connected to one nozzle <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to provide the ability to coat medical appliance <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with two different coatings. The different coatings may consist of different concentrations of the same therapeutic, the same therapeutic dissolved in different polymers or in different suspension fluids having different release rates, different therapeutics, or a combination of therapeutic materials and non-therapeutic materials (for instance lubricious materials) of any type noted above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, rather than applying a coating material with solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, a masking material may be applied.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a solenoid type fluid dispensing head in accord with the present invention. Solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is a normally closed electromagnetically controlled valve having inlet <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which connects to a pressurized coating source (not shown). The coating does not normally flow through solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> because poppet <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> seals the passage to nozzle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> under the influence of a spring (not shown). However, when a voltage is applied across contacts <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, current flows through coil <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, and an electromagnetic force is consequently applied to poppet <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Poppet <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is thereby induced to move in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, opening the passage and allowing the coating to flow. When poppet <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is in the open position, the coating flows out through nozzle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> onto the medical appliance (not shown). The wetted surfaces of solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are defined as those surfaces which contact the coating as it flows through solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. In one alternative embodiment, the wetted surfaces are made of materials which are resistant to dissolving by Toluene and alcohol-based materials. The wetted surfaces may be constructed of EPDM, PEEK, stainless steel, glass, ceramic, PPS, epoxy, or any other appropriate material. Applying a voltage at contact <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> induces a continuous flow of coating out of nozzle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling a thicker coating on the medical appliance with fewer passes required by solenoid type fluid dispensing head <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> over the specified portions of the medical appliance to achieve the desired coating thickness. Nozzle <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is a non-contact nozzle designed to eject the coating material in a controlled fashion from a distance at the medical appliance. The distance between the nozzle and the medical appliance may depend on the viscosity of the fluid being ejected. The diameter of the nozzle may be in the range of 1 micron to 5 millimeters. </paragraph>
