<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a thin film deposition system, a deposition device and a deposition method, and more particularly, to a hybrid in-line and batch type deposition system, a deposition pallet and deposition method using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, deposition systems used for depositing materials onto semiconductor substrates are classified into two categories: in-line type and batch type. In-line type deposition systems are used for relatively large sized substrate such as glass and sapphire, for example. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a conventional in-line type deposition system. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are loaded onto a linear conveyor mechanism disposed within a first load lock chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. After loading, the substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are transferred into a deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> containing a linear array of deposition sources <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As the substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> travel through the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the linear conveyor mechanism, each of the deposition sources <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> coats surfaces of the substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a thin film. Once the substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have completely traversed the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the now-processed substrates <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are transferred to a second load lock chamber <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for unloading. Accordingly, exposed surfaces of the now-processed substrates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> include at least one layer of deposited material. Thus, the in-line type deposition system performs a continuous coating process, thereby providing a high throughput. However, coating uniformity along the traversing direction is dependent upon the linear conveyor mechanism and coating uniformity along a width direction orthogonal to the traversing direction is dependent upon the deposition source. Accordingly, variations in either the linear conveyor mechanism and/or the deposition sources can lead to non-uniformity of the deposited material upon the substrates <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> show a conventional batch type deposition system. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, substrates <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are each disposed on circumferential portions of a substrate holder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. After the substrates <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are loaded onto the substrate holder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the substrate holder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is placed into a deposition chamber <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Multiple deposition sources <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are circumferentially disposed along sidewalls of the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In general, each of the multiple deposition sources <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> deposits the same material by sputtering, for example. Once the substrate holder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is placed into the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the substrate holder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotates about a central axis providing uniform deposition of material on exposed surfaces of each of the substrates <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, each of the substrates <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> loaded on the substrate holder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may have a corresponding planetary motion in addition to, or instead of, the rotational motion of the substrate holder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, the batch type deposition system provides uniform material deposition simultaneously on larger numbers of substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in contrast to in-line type deposition systems, the batch type deposition system does not operate in a continuous mode. Specifically, once deposition processing of the substrates <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the substrate holder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is completed, the substrate holder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> must be unload and replaced with a new substrate holder having unprocessed substrates. The unloading and replacing of substrates creates significant amounts of time in which the deposition chamber is not in use, i.e. &ldquo;down-time,&rdquo; and results in a relatively low throughput. Furthermore, the batch type deposition system allows for the deposition of only a single type of material. Thus, deposition of multiple layers of different materials is not possible. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to illustrated embodiment of the present invention, examples of which are shown in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an exemplary hybrid deposition system according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plurality of individual substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disposed on an outer face of a deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be of any specific individual geometry and may be a combination of individual substrates of different geometries. Furthermore, the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include any number of sides. The deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is axial disposed on a shaft of a deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> within a deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected to vacuum flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B that include vacuum seals <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> disposed about the vacuum flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B. The deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a first load lock portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a second load lock portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The first and second lock portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> each have both gas inlet ports <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and vacuum line ports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The vacuum flange <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A disposed within the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may include vacuum seals <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> disposed on opposite sides of the vacuum flange <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A while the vacuum flanges <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B disposed within the first and second load lock portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may include vacuums seals <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on a single side of the respective first and second load lock portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Deposition sources <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are circumferentially disposed along sidewalls of the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Since the deposition rate is dependent on the number of deposition sources <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, almost any number of deposition sources <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be used. Furthermore, although the deposition sources <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are shown to be rectangular in cross section, almost any geometry may be implemented. Even further, deposition sources may be disposed in multiple &ldquo;rings&rdquo; about the sidewalls of the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the hybrid deposition system continuously deposits material onto each exposed surface of the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby providing close to isotropic deposition. During operation of the hybrid deposition system, a deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> loaded with substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed onto deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the first load lock portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and the first and second load lock portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are sealed. Then, pressures of the first and second load lock portions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are first reduced via the vacuum line ports <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then adjusted with gas via gas inlet ports <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to match a pressure of the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is loaded with substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are laterally shifted from the first load lock portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to inside the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, the deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> loaded with processed substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> residing in the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are also laterally shifted from the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and transferred into the second load lock portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Once the deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> loaded with substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are completely inside of the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is sealed via the vacuum seals <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Then, the deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the deposition of material onto each exposed surface of the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> begins. Meanwhile, the second load lock portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is brought to ambient pressure and opened. The deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> loaded with processed substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is stopped and the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is removed. Then, a new deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> loaded with substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed on the deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the second load lock portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and awaits lateral transfer into the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for deposition processing. This repetitive process of loading and unloading deposition pallets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the first and second load locks <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> continues until the desired number of substrates and/or deposition pallets are processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows another exemplary hybrid deposition system according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> dual hybrid deposition system is shown which incorporates two of the single hybrid deposition systems shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, thereby effectively doubling throughput of the system. The dual hybrid deposition system includes a deposition chamber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> having a first deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and a second deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B. The first deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A includes a first load lock portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A, a deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, and a second load lock portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A. The deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A includes deposition sources <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A that are circumferentially disposed along sidewalls of the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A. The second deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B includes a first load lock portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B, a deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B, and a second load lock portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B. The deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B includes deposition sources <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B that are circumferentially disposed along sidewalls of the deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the second load lock portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A of the first deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and the first load lock portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>B of the second deposition chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B are coincide, thereby providing the dual hybrid deposition system with the ability to perform in-line type and batch type deposition of multiple materials onto the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the deposition portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>A may deposit a first material &ldquo;A&rdquo; onto the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. After the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are coated with the first material &ldquo;A,&rdquo; the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be removed from the second load lock portion <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A or laterally transferred into the deposition portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>B for deposition of a second material &ldquo;B.&rdquo; Accordingly, the number of individual hybrid deposition systems may be increased to process the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with any number of materials, or with any number of combinations of materials. For instance, if three individual single hybrid deposition systems where implemented, the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be coated with a first material &ldquo;A&rdquo; in a first deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A. Then, if desired, the substrates may forego deposition of a second material &ldquo;B&rdquo; in a second deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B and proceed to a deposition of a third material &ldquo;C&rdquo; in a third deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>C (not shown). Additionally, the substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be returned to the first deposition portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A for additional deposition of the material &ldquo;A,&rdquo; thereby forming substrates with a material layer combination of &ldquo;A-C-A.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another exemplary hybrid deposition system according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> continuous in-line batch type deposition system is shown where separate deposition portions are placed back-to-back, thereby providing both in-line and batch type deposition processing. The continuous batch type deposition system includes a deposition chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, a first load lock chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a second load lock chamber <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a first gate valve <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a second gate valve <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The deposition chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes first <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, second <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, third <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and fourth <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> deposition stages. Each of the deposition stages <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of deposition sources <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, circumferentially disposed about sidewalls of each of the deposition stages, respectively. Although four deposition stages are shown, any number of deposition stages may be implemented to achieve the desired substrate processing. Each of the deposition sources may be the same as or different from any adjacent deposition stage. For example, the deposition sources <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> may deposit material &ldquo;A&rdquo; at deposition stage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the deposition sources <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> may deposit material &ldquo;B&rdquo; at deposition stage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the deposition sources <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> may deposit the same material &ldquo;C&rdquo; at both deposition stages <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, respectively. Moreover, if the same material &ldquo;C&rdquo; is to be deposited at both deposition stages <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the deposition rates and/or conditions may be altered, thereby providing multiple layers of material &ldquo;C&rdquo; with each layer having different specific properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Similar to the dual hybrid deposition system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the in-line batch type deposition system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> allows for continuous deposition of different materials onto substrates <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, thereby further increasing throughput of the system. Here, a substrate pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> loaded with substrates <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is placed into the first load lock chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> includes a deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> that may be disposed at opposing ends of the substrate pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a single deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> may be disposed at either ends of the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The first and second load lock chambers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are sealed and processed to match the ambient conditions of the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Then, the first and second gate valves <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are opened, the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> loaded with substrates is transferred into the first stage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> for processing, the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> loaded with now-processed substrates is transferred into the second load lock chamber <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the first and second gate valves <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are closed. The second load lock chamber <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is opened and the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is removed from the deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, the first load lock chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is opened and a third deposition pallet loaded with substrates is placed into the first load lock chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to awaiting lateral transfer into the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> for deposition processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Inside the first stage <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is rotated via the deposition pallet rotator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and each exposed surface of the substrates <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is coated with a first material of the first deposition stage sources <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is then laterally transferred to a second deposition stage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> where a second material of the second deposition stage sources <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is deposited onto each exposed surface of the substrates <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. In a similar fashion, the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is then sequentially transferred to the third and fourth deposition stages <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> where third and fourth materials of the third and fourth deposition stages sources <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> are respectively deposited onto each exposed surface of the substrates <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Once the substrates <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> have been processed through each of the deposition stages, the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is laterally transferred to the second load lock chamber <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> via a gate valve <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is brought to the ambient conditions of the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Then, the gate valve <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is closed, the second load lock chamber <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is opened, and the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is removed from the second load lock chamber <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> During operation of the in-line batch type deposition system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the deposition pallets <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may laterally traverse the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in a stepwise manner or may traverse the deposition chamber <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> in a continuous, non-stepwise manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an exemplary deposition pallet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> deposition pallet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a deposition pallet mounting member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> upon which substrate platforms <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> reside, a deposition pallet frame member <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> attached to the deposition pallet mounting member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and a substrate pallet axial member <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> attached to the deposition pallet frame member <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and to a deposition pallet rotator (not shown). Each of the substrate platforms <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> may have a first side portion attached to the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> via a hinge assembly <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Substrates (not shown) may be individually attached to the substrate platforms <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> prior to deposition processing. Alternatively, the substrates may have hinge assemblies integrally attached thereto such that use of the substrate platforms <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> may not be necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> During deposition processing, the substrate platforms <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> are securely attached to the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> via individual latching mechanisms (not shown). Before, during and/or after the deposition processing, the individual latching mechanisms may be simultaneously released and the substrate platforms <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> may be sequentially rotated about each of the hinge assemblies <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, thereby exposing opposite sides of the substrates to the deposition processing and decreasing processing time. Alternatively, the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may exclude one or more of the substrate platforms <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> such that each substrate platform <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> may be sequentially rotated about corresponding hinge assemblies <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, thereby selectively exposing opposite sides of specific substrates to the deposition processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, although the exemplary deposition pallet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown having six platform sides, any number of platform sides may be implemented. In addition, the deposition pallet <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may include multiple substrate platforms <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> disposed on a single platform side, thereby accommodating substrates of different sizes and geometric configurations. Furthermore, each of the platform sides may have different sizes and geometric configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the capacitor and the manufacturing method thereof of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
