<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention allows anyone that has lost the involuntary control of swallowing, to consume frequent small amounts of fluids independently without help from care giver. This not only returns some dignity to the patient using the device but allows the care giver the freedom to perform other duties needed by the patient. Thus allowing the care giver the time to provide care to more patients. The patient can drink when they wish. This provides them with a better quality of life and can help prevent dehydration as well as promote a faster recovery. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Therefore the need for a device to allow patients to drink small amounts of liquids on their own, without help or dependency on anyone to help them. The care giver must feed the patient&apos;s the liquid they need by hand in small amounts, a teaspoon at a time. One ounce of liquid contains six teaspoons. The patients chin is tucked down to their chest to open the passageway to the stomach and prevent aspiration. This takes a large amount of time on the part of the care giver and is very expensive. And limits the amount of care a person can provide. This invention will eliminate the need for the care giver to administer the liquid by hand with a teaspoon. The patient can get liquid when they need it independently of the care giver. It is also important that the device be made to prevent the patient from getting large amounts of liquid, that would cause them to aspirate and possibly choke. This invention does this, it allows only the liquid held in the reservoir to be delivered to the patient when the cup is held up to the mouth and tipped toward the mouth. The device is set up right to refill the reservoir and deliver another pre-set amount of liquid to the patient. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention allows anyone with swallowing problems to drink liquid, anytime they want or need to drink. And to do this without help from anyone. Giving them more independence and control over themselves. The invention provides the proper amount of liquid to help prevent aspiration, while keeping the patient hydrated. Which prevents further deterioration of their health. The cup consists of two pieces. The cup that holds the liquid. The insert encompassing the extended mouth piece, lid, delivery tube and baffle plate or complete reservoir. This design allows for easy and complete cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. Cup, to hold liquids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Lid, delivery tube and baffle plate or reservoir to hold pre-measured amount of liquid. The baffle plate along with the side and bottom of the cup forms the reservoir in this design. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of promoting and understanding of the principles of the invention. Reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitations of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> While the invention will be described below for reference to a medical setting, it should be appreciated that the present invention can be adapted for use in other situations where fluid control is a concern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Add liquid to cup, place lid containing mouth piece, delivery tube and baffle plate that completes reservoir in cup making sure lid is secure. The reservoir will fill with liquid when submerged into the liquid. When cup is tipped up to drink, liquid is held in reservoir will flow through the tube into the mouth piece into the patients mouth. The remaining liquid will stay in the cup. The process of filling the reservoir will be repeated. By placing the cup in a up right position forcing liquid to the bottom of the cup refilling reservoir. When cup is raised toward the mouth and tilting the bottom upward placing the top of the cup in a downward position. And the bottom of the cup to the higher position forcing the liquid through the tube to the mouth piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Lid is vented to allow air flow from cup without forcing liquid out of the cup when the lid is put on the cup. And to allow air to reenter cup, helping the free flow of liquid. Cup can also be designed having a false bottom with a reservoir below the false bottom. The false bottom will have an opening to allow liquids to flow into reservoir below false bottom and be delivered to the patients mouth from the reservoir through the delivery tube without help. Cup can have one or two handles or no handle which ever is best. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and descriptions, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in charter, it being understood that only the preferred embodiment has been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. </paragraph>
