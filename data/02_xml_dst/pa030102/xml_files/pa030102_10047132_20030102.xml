<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Although a description will be given of an example in which the present invention is applied to a modem for power-line carrier communication as an apparatus used under a high-noise circumference, the present invention is also applicable to an apparatus of various fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> power of a power supply transformer station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied to a pole transformer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via a high-voltage line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of 6.6 kV, and further supplied to a house <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via a low-voltage line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of 100 V/200 V and a branch line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When a power-line carrier communication is performed in the above-mentioned power line system, an optical fiber (not shown in the figure) is provided between an access node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the power supply transformer station <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the modem provided to the pole transformer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in parallel to the high-voltage line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to transmit the communication signals via the optical fiber. The communication signals are transmitted between the pole transformer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the house <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via the 100 V/200 V low-voltage line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> between a modem, which is plugged into a receptacle connected to interior wiring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> within the house <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a modem of the pole transformer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned power line system is considered The low-voltage line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is considered to be an inductor of 1 &mgr;H/m as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> with respect to a spectrum of a transmission signal TX from the modem of the pole transformer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If the length of the low-voltage line is 150 m, it is considered to be an inductor of 150 &mgr;H/m. Additionally, the branch line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> connected to the low-voltage line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is considered as a capacitor of 75 pF/m. If 50-m branch lines corresponding to 30 houses are connected to the interior wiring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the branch lines are considered as a capacitor of 0.1125 &mgr;F. In addition, each of various electrical appliances connected to the interior wiring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided with a radio interference suppression capacitor between the AC 100 V lines, which provides a large capacitive load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As a result, when viewing the low-voltage line from the pole transformer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the low-voltage line is considered as a low-pass filter (LPF) of a low-pass type as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, and a high-frequency component of the reception signal RX greatly attenuates as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. Accordingly, in worst case, the high-frequency component may be buried in noises N when the high-frequency component reaches a communication terminal in the house. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, although the low-frequency band component does not attenuate as much as the high-frequency band component, the low-frequency band component is also buried in a large noise N as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> since an extremely large amount of random noise (white noise) is emitted from electric appliances using a switching power supply or an inverter device. Accordingly, a fast data communication using a power-line carrier has not been put into practical use, and there has been a demand for finding a solution for a long time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As a solution of such an issue, various modulation method such as an FM modulation method, an FSK modulation methods or a PSk modulation method, which are said to be resistant to a noise, has been used as a modulation method of a modem for the power-line carrier communication. However, a limited application has been made in practice, such as an application related to a low data transmission speed of less than 1200 bps since the power line has an extremely large noise level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Additionally, although an attempt has been made to put the power-line carrier communication using a spread spectrum method in practical use, a transmission capacity sharply decreases when an S/N value is a minus value as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> under a white noise circumstance. The transmission rate is 100 kbps at maximum, and it becomes incapable of carrying out communication in worst case. Further, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) method using a multi-carrier modulation method has been introduced so as to attempt an application of a technology to carry out communication while avoiding a carrier band having a lot of noises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> However, the number of switching power source and inverter devices in home electric appliances, which are main source of noises, tends to increase, and it has become further difficult to avoid an attenuation of high-band signals due to the capacitive load. Accordingly, the power-line carrier communication can be put in a practical in a low-speed communication, but it is impossible to achieve the power-line carrier communication at a high rate as high as a few Mbps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the future, the number of switching power source and inverter devices in home electric appliances will be increased, and it will become further difficult to avoid an attenuation of high-band signals due to the capacitive load. Under such circumstances, the communication being carried out while avoiding noises in the prior art is not sufficient. Rather, it is effective to positively take measures for noise so as to achieve a fast communication by canceling or removing the noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The applicants discloses, in Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-359949 titled &ldquo;noise canceling method and apparatus&rdquo;, the invention to achieve a fast communication by reproducing reception signals buried in noises, if the S/N value is minus as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, by canceling a low-band noise component having a small signal attenuation. The invention of the prior application extracts reception signals buried in noises by turning the S/N value to a plus value by removing a noise component in a dominant band with respect to a colored noise in a macroscopic view. The band of noise to be canceled is fixed within a predetermined range, and it is effective to a case in which the noise component is particularly concentrated into a low band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, there is a case in which a noise having a comb-like spectrum distributed in a wide band is generated due to a noise of use of an inverter provided equipped in home electric appliances or a frequent band noise generated by radio interference by AM broadcasting carrier. In such as case, if only a noise within a predetermined range is cancelled, the S/N value deteriorates which generates frequent reception errors since noises in ranges other than the noise canceling band remain uncanceled. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Prior to a description of an embodiment of the present invention, a description will be given of an outline of the prior invention of canceling a noise in which a band for canceling a noise is a fixed range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, an S/N ratio is maintained to be a minus value even if a low-frequency range (noise component N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, signal component S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is cut off so as to transmit data using a high-frequency range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> However, the S/N value can be turned to a plus value by extracting a relatively high-level reception signal S buried in noises in the low band as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> by canceling the dominant noise component N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the low band with respect to a noise which is a colored noise in a macroscopic view such as a low-band enhancement type noise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. The prior invention predicts by interpolation a noise component from the reception signal containing a specific signal having specific time position, amplitude and phase to carry out a noise cancellation so as to reproduce an original transmitted signal by removing the noise component from the reception signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a structure diagram of a transmission/reception system according to a prior art; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a transmission/reception system according to the prior invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, on a transmission side, there is provided a zero point inserting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between a transmission signal generating part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The zero point inserting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> inserts a specific signal having an insertion time position, an amplitude and a phase, which are previously specified. Hereinafter, it is assumed that the specific signal has an amplitude equal to zero and the specific signal is referred to as &ldquo;zero point signal&rdquo; or simply referred to as &ldquo;zero signal&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, on a reception side, a noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided between the nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a reception signal reproducing part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprises a frequency shifting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a thinning part (DCM), an interpolating part (IPL) <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a frequency reverse-shifting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a subtracting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> predicts by interpolation a noise component form the reception signal containing the zero point signal inserted in predetermined time positions and removes the noise component form the reception signal so as to reproduce the original transmitted signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>-(A), it is assumed that a symbol rate of transmission signals S generated by the transmission signal generating part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is 192 kB. When the transmission signals S are given to the zero point inserting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the zero point inserting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> inserts the zero point signal between the transmission signals S as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>-(B), and transmits the transmission signals S to the nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this case, if the zero point signal is transmitted at the same rate as the transmission signals S, the transmission symbol rate is 384 kb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The reception side receives a signal including the transmission signal S and the zero point signal each of which has a noise N added thereto while passing through the transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>-(C). Accordingly, the noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> extracts only the noise N at the zero point, and generates a noise interpolation signal N&prime; for each reception signal point from the noise N on both sides of each reception signal point, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>-(D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Then, by subtracting the noise interpolation signal N&prime; from each reception signal (S&plus;N), a signal (corresponding to the transmission signal) consisting of only the signal component S form which the noise N is substantially canceled can be reproduced as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>-(E). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A description will be given of an operation of the noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned transmission signal S is transmitted at a rate of 192 kB as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. A spectrum represented by scalar (horizontal axis represents a frequency band kHz) is shown on the right part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. When the zero point signal is inserted into the transmission signal S as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, the frequency band of the transmission signal after insertion is 384 kb. In this case, a spectrum is mirror copied with a center of &plus;192 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> When the transmission signal with the inserted zero point signal is transmitted to the reception side, the noise component N is added to each of the transmission signal S and the zero point signal in the reception signal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>. The spectrum in this case is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7D</cross-reference> show an operation when the reception signal is frequency-shifted by the frequency shifting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and is transmitted to the thinning part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows a sampling value S(n) of the reception signal and a spectrum thereof. It should be noted that the spectra shown on the right side of each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7</cross-reference> D distribute 0 to fs/2 (fs is a sampling frequency) since a noise is added in the nyquist transmission path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The Z transformation A of the sample value S(n) of the reception signal is represented by the following equation.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>A&equals;S</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight>)&equals;&Sgr;<highlight><italic>S</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>)<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;n</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The Z transformation B of an inverted signal of the reception signal S(n) is represented by the following equation.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>B&equals;Z</italic></highlight>&lsqb;(&minus;1)<highlight><superscript>n</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>S</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>)&rsqb;&equals;<highlight><italic>S</italic></highlight>(&minus;<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(2)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The inverted signal in this case is provided with the factor (&minus;1)<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>since the inversion is carried out with respect to only the signal component of at the signal point. Additionally, the Z transformation C of a signal t(n) obtained by summing the inverted signal (&minus;1)<highlight><superscript>n</superscript></highlight>S(n) and the reception signal S(n) is represented by the following equation.

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The thus-obtained thinning signal u(n) is provided to the interpolating part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> so as to achieve an operation shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>. That is, the output signal u(n) of the thinning part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is only a noise component having a sample value and a spectrum as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A and the signal t(n) which is obtained by inserting the zero point signal into the noise component has a sample value and a spectrum as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, and the Z transformation A thereof is represented by the following equation.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Since T(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), t(<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), . . . &equals;0, the above equation is changed as follows.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Thus, the following equation is given.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> By interpolating the zero point with the noise component N on both sides of the zero point with respect to the signal T(z), a signal having the same transmission rate as the reception signal S(n) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A and having only a noise component is obtained. Thus, by subtracting the interpolated signal from the reception signal S(n), the transmission signal to which the zero point signal is inserted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is obtained. It should be noted that the transmission signal shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> can be obtained by removing the zero point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Although the above description indicates how the transmission signal is reproduced on the reception side, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows how the noise component is removed by paying attention to only the noise component. That is, when the transmission signal has a transmission band of 192 kB (&equals;&plusmn;96 kB), the band is doubled if the zero point insertion is applied to the transmission signal. Additionally, a copy component is generated, and is transmitted to the nyquist transmission path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Then, a noise having a noise distribution a over &plusmn;192 kB is added to the transmission signal. In the noise distribution a, the noise level is high particularly in the frequency band &minus;192 to 0 kHz in the left half, and low in frequency band 0 to &plus;192 kHz in the right half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> When a shift is made by the frequency shifting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the reception side noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by &plus;96 kHz, a noise distribution b is obtained in which the noise components A and B shift by &plus;96 kHz, and, thereby the noise component D in the noise distribution a is folded as &minus;192 kHz to &minus;96 kHz. Thus, a noise band to be predicted is shifted to the interpolation band, which results in an effective cancellation of a noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> If a thinning operation is performed in this state, the frequency becomes one half. Accordingly, the noise component A is folded as &plus;96 to &plus;192 kHz, the noise component B is folded as &minus;192 to &minus;96 kHz, the noise component C is folded as &minus;96 to 0 kHz, and the noise component D is folded as 0 to &plus;96 kHz. It should be noted that an amount of shift which is &plus;96 kHz is merely an example, and any frequency can be selected so as to minimize the folded component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Then, an interpolating operation of the zero point is performed by the interpolating part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and the noise components (A&plus;C) and (B&plus;D) on each side are removed by filtering, which results that the noise components (A&plus;C) and (B&plus;D) remain in the range of &minus;96 to &plus;96 kHz. When interpolated noise component is shifted in the reverse direction, that is, by &minus;96 kHz, the noise components (A&plus;C) and (B&plus;D) remain only in the range of &minus;192 to 0 kHZ as in the noise distribution e shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the noise distribution f in which the noise components A and B are canceled in the range of &minus;192 to 0 kHz by subtracting the noise components from the entire noise component in the noise distribution a by the subtracting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the remaining noise components C and D have a low noise level and, thus, there is no large influence to the S/N value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the noise canceled reception signal can be reproduced substantially corresponding to the transmission signal. It should be noted that the reason for carrying out the frequency shift as mentioned above is to set the interpolation predicting band to be the band having a maximum amount of noise (the low band in the above-mentioned example) and to select a band having a small amount of noise with respect to the frequency band to be folded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that a single zero point is inserted between the signal points in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C, while various variations are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A through 10E</cross-reference>. That is, in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, one zero point is provided to every three transmission signals S, and the noise prediction band is 96 kHz. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, one zero point is provided to every two transmission signals S, and the noise prediction band is 128 kHz. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>C, one zero point is provided to each transmission signal S, and the noise prediction band is 192 kHz. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>D, two zero points are provided to each transmission signal S, and the noise prediction band is 256 kHz. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>E, three zero points are provided to each transmission signal S, and the noise prediction band is 288 kHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10D and 10E</cross-reference>, a noise in a larger band can be canceled as the number of inserted zero points is increased. Although the data transmission rate is decreased, a resistance to a worse communication environment is given and the noise resistance is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> For example, in a case in which a communication is carried out with a narrow band, a noise cancellation is carried out since the interference between signals is increased, which results in cancellation of the signals themselves. In such a case, the entire rate should be decreased and optimize system parameters so as to effectively cancel a noise without attenuation of the signals. Further, an equalizer may be added before the noise canceling part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the number of zero points to be inserted can be adaptively changed by determining the signal quality on the reception side, determining the number of zero points in response to the determination of the signal quality and notifying the transmission side of the determined number of zero points. Moreover, for example, the zero point insertion may be carried out on the transmission side using a pseudo-random (PN) sequence. Accordingly, the reception side can carry out noise interpolation prediction with respect to a random noise according to the PN sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As for the example of the PN sequence, there are following sequences.</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>15 chips : 111101011001000</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>31 chips : 1111100110100100001010111011000 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In this case, the zero point can be sequentially inserted while the time axis is shifted as in the Muses method, which is used in an image compression method. There are various other methods to insert the zero point, and optimization may be carried out in accordance with the system characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The interpolating part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> can be constituted by various filters as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 1C</cross-reference>. A low-pass filter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> has a transmission bandwidth equal to a interpolation prediction bandwidth, and has a characteristic that although there is no folding outside the interpolation prediction bandwidth, the number of taps is large when the filter is constituted by a transversal filter and its cancellation range is narrow. A COS square filter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> has a nyquist width equal to the interpolation prediction bandwidth, and has a characteristic that the number of taps is small and its cancellation range is large, but folding occurs outside the interpolation prediction range. A COS filter shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference> has a nyquist width equal to the interpolation prediction bandwidth, and has a characteristic that the number of taps is large and an amount of computation is large, and folding occurs outside the interpolation prediction bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a modem, which carries out the above-mentioned noise cancellation. In the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A, a</cross-reference> scrambler (SCR S/R) applies a scramble process to a transmission signal (SD) and converts a serial signal to a parallel signal, sends the transmission signal (SD) to a vector summing circuit (G/N sum). The vector summing circuit (G/N sum) converts the signal, which is a gray binary code (G), into a natural binary code (N) signal with respect to the parallel signal, and carries out a vector summing operation, which corresponds to a vector difference circuit (difference N/G) used for a phase detection on the reception side, and thereafter sends the signal to the transmission signal generating part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The transmission signal generating part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sends the transmission signal S as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>-(A) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. After the zero point signal is inserted between the signals S by the zero point inserting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the signal is waveform-shaped by a roll off filter (ROF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). An output signal of the roll off filter (ROF<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is modulated by a modulation circuit (MOD), and further converted from a digital signal to an analog signal by a D/A conversion circuit (D/A). Thereafter, a signal of a low-frequency band including the frequency band (10 kHz to 450 kHz) of a power-line carrier is extracted by a low-pass filter (LPF), and the signal is sent to a transmission line TX-line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The transmission signal sent through the transmission line TX-line is received by a remote modem through a reception line RX-line. A predetermined frequency band component (10 to 450 kHz in a case of a power-line carrier modem) is extracted by a band-pass filter (BPF), and converted into a digital signal by an A/D converter (A/D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The digitally described analog signal is demodulated to a base band signal by a demodulation circuit (DEM), and waveform-shaped by a roll off filter (ROF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Then, the output signal of the roll off filter (ROF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is sent to a timing extracting part (TIM). An output signal of the timing extracting part (TIM) is sent to a voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO) type phase locked loop circuit (PLL VCXO). The phase locked loop circuit (PLL VCXO) extracts a phase of the zero point, and a phase signal of the zero point is supplied to the A/D converter (A/D) as a sampling timing signal, and is also supplied to a clock distributing part (RX-CLK) of the reception part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The noise component of the transmission path contained in the output signal of the roll off filter (ROF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the reception part is removed by the noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an interference between signals is removed by an equalizer (EQL). Then, the signal is subjected to phase-matching by a carrier automatic phase controller (CAPC). Further, a signal determination of the reception signal is carried out by a determination circuit (DEC), and the result of determination is output to a vector difference circuit (difference N/G). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The vector difference circuit (difference N/G) carried out a vector difference calculation reverse to that performed by the vector summing circuit (G/N sum) of the transmission part according to a natural binary code (N), and, thereafter, returns to a gray binary code (G) and sends to a descrambler (P/S DSCR). The descrambler (P/S DSCR) converts the parallel gray code to a serial signal so as to apply a descramble process, and outputs the signal as a reception signal (RD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in the transmission part, the transmission clock distributing circuit (TX-CLK) distributes a transmission clock to the zero point inserting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the D/A converter (D/A) and other parts. Moreover, in the reception part, the reception clock distributing circuit (RX-CLK) extracts a reception clock from the VCXP type phase locked loop circuit (PLL VCXO), and distributes the reception clock to the noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and other parts in the reception part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the reception clock distribution circuit (RX-CLK) merely passes the zero point phase signal extracted by the VCXO type phase locked loop circuit (PLL VCXO), and the zero point phase signal is mere a symbol timing signal. Moreover, a part surrounded by dashed lines in the figure corresponds to the nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transparently transmits a signal having an interval grater than the nyquist interval ({fraction (1/384)} kb). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, there is a case in which a noise having a comb-like spectrum is generated over a wide band due to use of home electric appliances equipped with inverter. In such a case, as even if a noise cancellation is carried out in a low band as shown in <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> A, the S/N value cannot be improved since noises remain in bands other than the noise cancellation band as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, which may cause generation of signal errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, the noise cancellation bands are selected in accordance with a practical noise condition of the reception signal, and frequency bands having a large level noise component are discriminated. Then, a noise cancellation is carried out for the frequency bands having a large noise level so as to cancel large level noises as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> so that the S/N value, which was a minus value before noise cancellation, is changed to a plus value after the noise cancellation. For example, a noise cancellation is effectively carried out for noises in scattered bands generated in a wide band transmission in a MHz area caused by an AM broadcasting carrier so as to achieve fast transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a functional block diagram of noise cancellation which carries out a noise distribution recognition according to the present invention. The transmission side carries out zero insertion by the zero point inserting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in a case in which the aforementioned noise cancellation in a fixed band. The transmission signal having a zero point inserted therein is added with a noise when passing through the nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The reception signal passes through the nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is subject to recognition of a noise distribution by a noise distribution recognizing part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a noise canceling part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, a comparison is made by a noise power comparing part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to powers (PWR) of a pair of signals corresponding to copied frequencies generated by the insertion of the zero point on the transmission side, and a determination is made as to a band having a large noise in accordance with the result of comparison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Then, only a noise component is extracted by a thinning part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a zero point if inserted between signals corresponding to the noise components by a zero point inserting part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> so as to return the frequency band to the original frequency band. Then, a predicted noise to be cancelled is generated by a noise predicting part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by selecting a band having a larger noise, which is determined by the noise power comparing part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The predicted noise is subtracted from the reception signal by a subtracting part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so as to carry out noise cancellation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> A no transmission energy (NTE) section, in which a signal is not periodically transmitted, is provided to a transmission frame so as to recognize a noise distribution on the reception side. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is an illustration of a transmission frame containing the no-transmission energy section. In the transmission frame, a single master frame is constituted by 64 subframes each of which comprises a unit of 4.8 kHz. Among the 64 subframes, one subframe is set as a no-transmission energy (NTE) section so as to be assigned to a section containing only a noise. Master frame synchronization and noise distribution investigation are carried out using the no-transmission energy (NTE) section. </paragraph>

The fast Fourier transforming part (FFT) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> divides the component of the reception signal into frequency bands the same as that of a fast Fourier transformation being carried out on the reception data. At this time, the fast Fourier transforming part (FFT) <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> also outputs a copy component generated by the zero point insertion on the transmission side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The reception signal of the no-transmission energy section (NTE subframe) contains a component of each frequency band of a noise in the transmission path.

In the functional block diagram, the reception signal (x&plus;jy) having the master frame in synchronization with the reference phase is supplied to the noise extracting part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The noise extracting part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thins out the data signal by a thinning part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to extract only a noise component.

Since the transmission side periodically sends a zero point signal, the energy of this section is zero and a power spectrum corresponding to a rate of insertion of the zero point is extracted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The thus-obtained power value is passes through the band-pass filter (BPF) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a center frequency of 192 kHz so as to extract desired zero point information, which is sent to the vectorizing circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The vectorizing circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> vectorizes the input signal by synthesizing with a signal having a phase difference by <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> degrees, and outputs the vectorized signal to the VCXO type phase locked loop circuit (PLL VCXO) as timing phase information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In the VCXO type phase locked loop circuit (PLL VCXO), the timing phase information from the vectorizing circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is compared with a phase of a reference point by the comparing circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the signal indicating the phase difference is passed through the low-pass filter (LPF) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> so as to obtain a low-band component. The low-band component is passed through the secondary PLL circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> constituted by two integrators, and is converted into an analog signal by the digital/analog (D/A) converter circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows another example of the noise prediction according to the present invention. In this example, instead of the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> in which the fast Fourier transformation and the noise prediction by an inverting transformation, the same process can be achieved by carrying out a demodulation and a modulation for each frequency component.

In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</cross-reference> in which a fast Fourier transformation is carried out, since attenuation of side lobe is only 17 dB, there is large leakage to adjacent band and an accurate noise prediction output may not be obtained. On the other hand, in the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</cross-reference> in which the low-pass filter (LPF) is used, if a 100%COS<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>roll off filter is used, attenuation of side lobe as high as 43 dB is easily obtained, and, thereby, an extremely accurate noise prediction output can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram of the low-band noise cancellation and the noise distribution recognition. In this example, a low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a high-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided. The low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> cancels a low-band noise in the similar manner as the noise canceling part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. A frequency shifting and thinning part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> corresponds to the frequency shifting part <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the tinning part (DCM) <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The high-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> applies a noise cancellation according to the above-mentioned noise distribution recognition shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> with respect to a noise having a frequency higher than that cancelled by the low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Since each functional block in the high-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the same as that of the functional block shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, blocks that are the same as the function blocks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> are given the same reference numerals and duplicate descriptions thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> According to the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, there is no deterioration in an accuracy of the noise distribution recognition, and noise cancellation can be accurately performed over the entire band. Especially in the power-line carrier, a noise is dominant in a low band, and when the low-band noise is large, the side lobe of the output of the fast Fourier transformation is large as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference>. Thus, when the noise components are adjacent to each other as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>B, an interference of the side lobe give to the adjacent band is increased, which results in deterioration of the accuracy of the noise distribution recognition in the low-band which receives the interference. However, by performing the noise distribution recognition after the low-band noise cancellation like the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the accuracy of the noise distribution recognition can be prevented from being deteriorated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A through 28D</cross-reference> are illustrations showing results of the noise cancellation by the noise distribution recognition according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</cross-reference> shows a degree of eye-pattern degradation when the S/N value becomes 0 dB at a point of 248 kHz due to a tone noise of 248 kHz and noise cancellation is not performed. The degree of AI-deterioration is shown sequentially in four frequency bands on the right side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Although the OFDM method is said to be resistant to a tone noise, it is limited to a case in which an S/N ratio for the tone noise is sufficiently maintained as in a telephone line or a radio communication line. If the S/N ratio is equal to about 0 dB (S/N&equals;0 dB), the eye-pattern degradation is limited to a band concerned and there is less influence to other channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</cross-reference> shows a case in which the S/N value of a tone noise point of 248 kHz is &minus;10 dB and noise cancellation is not performed. In this case, the eye-pattern degradation is generated in adjacent channels other than the channel corresponding to the tone noise frequency. However, a degree of eye-pattern degradation decreases as a frequency shifts away from the tone noise frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</cross-reference> shows a case in which the S/N value of a tone noise point of 248 kHz is &minus;20 dB and noise cancellation is not performed. In this case, eye-pattern degradation exceeding 100% is generated almost all channels, and it is almost impossible to carry out a communication in practice. This is because the general FDM method uses a broad filter in which a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) for channel separation itself decreases at sinx/x, and, thereby, the interference with adjacent channels cannot be sufficiently removed even if frequencies are different. Accordingly, in this case, it is difficult to carry out a communication under a noisy environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28D</cross-reference> shows a case in which the SIN value of a tone noise point of 152 kHz is &minus;20 dB and noise cancellation is performed. There is less AI-degradation over all channels by noise cancellation even when the S/N ratio is &minus;20 dB at which all channels are degraded, and it can be appreciated that a large effect is obtainable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> is a block diagram of an example in which a rearrangement of channels is carried out in accordance with a noise distribution. In this example, a system control corresponds to notification of sending is sent to the transmission side. A reception part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which receives a signal from a transmission part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through a full duplex transmission path <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, investigates a noise distribution in the reception signal by a noise distribution investigating part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and send the result of investigation from a noise distribution notifying part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to a remote transmission station through a transmitting part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The remote transmission station receives the notification by a receiving part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and recognizes a state of noise distribution in the reception side by a noise distribution receiving part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. A copy assignment changing part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> carries out a rearrangement of channels so that noises scattered on the transmission path are concentrated into a low band when the remote reception station restores the arrangement of the channels, and sends the rearranged channel signal from a transmitting part <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Upon reception of the rearranged channel signal, the reception side gathers the scattered noises in a low band by carrying out a channel change to restore the arrangement of the channels. Thus, if there is a large noise in scattered bands in a high band range, an effective noise cancellation can be achieved by carrying out the aforementioned low-band noise cancellation according to the present invention. </paragraph>

For example, when a signal of 384 kb is generated by inserting zero points between signals of 192 kB, this means in a view point of frequency that a signal of a band of 192 kHz is copied to the adjoining band which results in generation off signal having a 384 kHZ band. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as a method for generating the same signal, there is a method as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</cross-reference> in which signal points of all channels are copied to an adjacent band so as to double the number of channels after signal points of each channel are output from a transmission signal generating part <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the signal on the frequency axis is converted into signal on the time axis by an inverting fast Fourier transforming part (IFFT) <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and sends the converted signal to a nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is a functional block diagram of structure of the reception side for rearranging channels according to a noise distribution. First, a low band noise of the signal received from the nyquist transmission path <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is canceled by a first low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The first low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the same as the low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, in a channel rearranging part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, components of channels output from a fast Fourier transforming part (FFT) <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are restored to the original order by a channel restoring part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, thereby rearranging the channels so that the scattered noises on the transmission path are concentrated into a low band. Then, the signal is converted into a time sequence signal by an inverting fast Fourier transforming part (IFFT) <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and is output to a second low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. At this time, a noise distribution is simultaneously recognized by a noise distribution recognizing part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the recognized noise distribution is sent to a remote station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The second low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a structure the same as the structure of the low-band noise canceling part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. Thus, large noises in a scattered bands on a high band can be effectively canceled by canceling the noises gathered to a low-band side by the channel rearrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33, 34</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> show a channel rearranging operation according to a noise distribution. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> shows an example of a noise distribution detected by a noise distribution recognition part in the reception side. The reception side investigates a noise distribution using a no-transmission energy section (NTE frame), and represents &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;0&rdquo; as to whether a noise has a constant value for each frequency band, and notifies the remote station of the result of investigation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference> indicates an example in which noises in the bands F<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, F&prime;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and F&prime;<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> exceed a predetermined value. It should be noted that the noise distribution recognition corresponds to the output of the noise distribution recognizing part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> shows an example of a rearrangement of the channels on the transmission side. On the transmission side, a channel copy is carried out first so as to cancel a low-band noise. In this example, the zero point is inserted every three signals, and the 16 channels f<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to f<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> show in the figure are copied to the channels f&prime;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to f<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

That is, in this example, the channels F<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, F&prime;<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and F&prime;<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is replaced by the channels F<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. At this time, the channels are arranged so that the channels F<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to F<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the channels F&prime;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to F&prime;<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> have a copied relationship when they are restored on the reception side.

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> shows a noise distribution of the reception signal and a noise distribution after restoration of channels on the reception side. First, a low-band noise cancellation is carried out for the channels f<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to f<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. After a fast Fourier transformation (FFT), a transmission path noise appears in the channels corresponding to the original F<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When change of channels is carried out so as to restore the original channels based on the result of noise distribution recognition, the noise distribution on the lower part of the figure is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> After restoring the original channels, the channels F<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to F<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the channels F&prime;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to F&prime;<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are in a copied relationship. Accordingly, the scattered noises are cancelled by carrying out the aforementioned low-band noise cancellation. It should be noted that the signals shown in the upper part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> correspond to the output of the fast Fourier transforming part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, and the signals shown in the lower part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> correspond to the output of the channel restore part <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
