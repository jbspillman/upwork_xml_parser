<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a sampling filter for chlorinated organic compounds, especially a filter for removing chlorinated organic compounds contained in a fluid from the fluid and sampling them. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A waste gas generated from incineration facilities for incinerating wastes such as industrial wastes and domestic refuse contains various types of chlorinated organic compound such as dioxins, coplanar PCBs, and further polychlorobiphenyl, chlorophenol and chlorobenzene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Here, the word, dioxins, is a general term of polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorodibenzofuran (PCDFs), and the like and as known well, they are extremely toxic environmental pollutants and especially tetrachlorodibenzodioxins (T<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>CDDs) among them is known as the most intensely toxic environmental pollutant. Further, polychlorobiphenyls are also strongly toxic environmental pollutants and coplanar PCBs among them is recognized similarly as the most intensely toxic environmental pollutant. On the other hand, although chlorinated organic compounds such as chlorophenol, chlorobenzene and the like are less toxic than dioxins, they are recognized as environmental pollutants just like dioxins since they are found easy to be converted into dioxins using various element contained in fly ashes as catalyst in, for example, an incinerator in a temperature range of the waste gas. For that, in terms of the environmental preservation, it becomes an urgent issue to establish a countermeasure for removing such various chlorinated organic compounds as described above from a fluid such as a waste gas and wastewater and at the same time it is also urgent to establish a technique of analysis of such chlorinated organic compounds contained in a fluid in global scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At the time of analyzing chlorinated organic compounds contained in a fluid, at first, a sample has to be taken precisely and accurately from a fluid to be an object for the analysis. For example, in the case of analysis of chlorinated organic compounds contained in a waste gas,a prescribed amount of a sample gas is sampled from a space containing the waste gas, for example, a flue duct to pass the waste gas through and various chlorinated organic compounds contained in the sample gas are required to be reliably collected without leakage. Especially, since dioxins and coplanar PCBs, environmental pollutants as described above, are contained extremely slight in amounts in the sample gas and regardless of the existence forms such as particulate form or gaseous form, the types varies widely, failing precise sampling, highly reliable analysis results cannot be expected. Further, the above-described coplanar PCBs is contained in a large amount in atmospheric air and if the sample gas is contaminated with such coplanar PCBs, highly reliable analysis results cannot either be expected. For that, in order to guarantee the accuracy of the analysis results, Japan, US, and each country of Europe respectively have been officially regulating the sampling methods of samples necessary to analyze the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs contained in, for example, a waste gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, the Japanese Industrial Standards JIS K 0311: 1999 formulated on Sep. 20, 1999 regulates, &ldquo;A measurement method of dioxins and coplanar PCBs in waste gas&rdquo; and practically exemplifies a sampling apparatus of a sample gas containing chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins. The sampling apparatus is provided with a sampling tube for sampling a sample gas from a flue duct in which a waste gas of an incinerator flows through, a first collector equipped with a filter unit for sampling the chlorinated organic compounds mainly in a particulate form contained in the gas sampled in the sampling tube, and a second collector for sampling the chlorinated organic compounds in a gaseous form difficult to be sampled by the first collector. In this case, the second collector is provided with mainly a liquid collecting section composed of a plurality of impingers made of glass and filled with an absorption liquid and an adsorptive collecting section containing an adsorbent (e.g. XAD-2) so as to collect the chlorinated organic compounds in the gaseous state, which are not collected by the first collector, by the absorption liquid and the adsorbent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such a sampling apparatus has a complicated constitution comprising the first collector and the second collector and is costly owing to the use of many appliances made of glass, so that in many cases, the apparatus is used repeatedly. In such a case, since it is required to keep the respective members such as impingers clean in order to retain the reliability of the measurement data, the preparatory operation such as a washing work and the like to be carried out before sampling of a sample gas becomes extremely complicated. Further, at the time of sampling the gaseous chlorinated organic compounds contained in the sample gas by the second collector, the second collector is required to be cooled by a cooling material such as dry ice and the sample-sampling operation itself becomes extremely complicated, too. Further, after the sampling of the sample gas, the chlorinated organic compounds collected by the first collector and the second collector are needed to be extracted and in this case, the chlorinated organic compounds separately collected by the first collector and the second collector are needed to be extracted separately. Therefore, the extraction operation itself becomes complicated and takes a long time to finish and further the reliability of the analysis results is, in many cases, affected by the skills of the extraction operation. Further, the sampling apparatus comprises two types of collectors, the first collector and the second collector, so that the apparatus is inevitably enlarged, and also glass appliances are used a lot, therefore the apparatus is easy to be broken to make handling and transportation difficult at the time of sampling the sample gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, Environment Preservation Agency (EPA) of USA. and Comite de Europeen Normalisation (CEN) have determined official methods independently and the sampling apparatuses described therein are not so much different from the Japanese one described above in terms of the complication of the constitution and the difficulty of handling although there exist miner difference in details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to simultaneously collect and sample various kinds of chlorinated organic compounds in both particulate form and gaseous form and easily extract the sampled chlorinated organic compounds. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A sampling filter for chlorinated organic compounds according to the present invention is for removing chlorinated organic compounds contained in a fluid from the fluid and sampling them, and comprises a fluid-permeable molded body containing fibers and an inorganic binder for binding the fibers to one another. In this case, the molded body has a bulk density of, for example, 0.1 to 1 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Further, the fibers are of at least one kind of fibers selected from a group consisting of fibrous activated carbon, carbon fiber, glass fiber, alumina fiber, silica fiber and Teflon fiber. The inorganic binder has an adsorbing capability to, for example, chlorinated organic compounds. In this case, the inorganic binder is of at least one kind of compounds selected from a group consisting of alumina, zeolite and silicon dioxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of a sampling filter for the chlorinated organic compounds according to the invention, the above-described fibers are activated alumina fibers and the above-described inorganic binder is a granular activated alumina. In this case, the bulk density of the above-described molded body is, for example, 0.3 to 0.7 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Since the sampling filter of the invention is of a fluid-permeable molded body, a fluid containing various types of chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs in both particulate form and gaseous form can be passed through. At that time, the various types of chlorinated organic compounds in both forms are collected simultaneously by the fibers and the inorganic binder contained in the molded body to be separated from the fluid. That is, various types of the chlorinated organic compounds in both particulate and gaseous forms contained in the fluid are sampled by the molded body. The sampled chlorinated organic compounds are extracted by a variety of extraction operations for the resulting molded body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The production method of the present invention is a method for producing a filter for removing chlorinated organic compounds contained in a fluid from the fluid and sampling them, and comprises steps of producing a molding material containing fibers and an inorganic binder for binding the fibers to one another and molding the molding material into a prescribed shape and then sintering the molded material. The production method further comprises, a step of, for example, immersing the obtained molded body in an aqueous dispersion of an inorganic binder and then drying it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the production method, since the molding material is sintered after being molded as described above, a molded body having a fluid-permeability can be produced. Since the molded body contains the fibers and the inorganic binder, when a fluid containing various types of chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs in both particulate and gaseous forms passes through, the molded body can collect simultaneously various types of chlorinated organic compounds in both forms to remove them from the fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A collector of the chlorinated organic compounds according to the present invention is for collecting the chlorinated organic compounds contained in a fluid flowing in a transportation pipe, and comprises a filter of a fluid-permeable molded body and a container for housing the filter and having a discharge outlet for discharging the fluid passed through the filter to the outside. The filter contains fibers and an inorganic binder for binding the fibers to one another. The filter has, for example, a cylindrical shape with an opening part to insert the transportation pipe into in one side and closed in the other side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In the collector, the fluid from the transportation pipe is discharged through the discharge outlet to the outside after being passed through the filter in the container. At that time, various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs in both particulate and gaseous forms contained in the fluid are simultaneously collected by the fibers and the inorganic binder, separated from the fluid and sampled by the filter. The various types of the chlorinated organic compounds sampled by the filter are extracted by a variety of extraction operations for the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A sampling method of chlorinated organic compounds according to the present invention is a method for sampling chlorinated organic compounds contained in a fluid flowing in a transportation pipe, and comprises a step of passing a fluid from the transportation pipe through a filter of a fluid-permeable molded body containing fibers and an inorganic binder for binding the fibers to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Since the sampling method is carried out using said filter of the fluid-permeable molded body containing the fibers and the inorganic binder for binding the fibers to one another, when the fluid from the transportation pipe passes through the filter, the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs in both particulate and gaseous forms contained in the fluid are simultaneously collected and sampled by the filter. The various types of the chlorinated organic compounds sampled by the filter are extracted by carrying out a variety of extraction operations for the filter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the second supporting unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a unit made of a resin or a metal as same as the first supporting unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is formed to be like a cover having a spiral groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the inner circumferential face and has a through hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to insert the introduction pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> into. The second supporting unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is fixed in the spiral groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the projected unit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the first supporting unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by screwing with the spiral groove <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while the introduction pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> being inserted into the through hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> installed in such a collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be detached from the holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In this case, the second supporting unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the installation unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is detached from the first supporting unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the introduction pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is pulled out the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. When the first supporting unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is detached from the holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be taken out of the holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> while being supported by the first supporting unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The aspirator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is provided with a gas discharge route <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a suction apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The gas discharge route <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is joined to the discharge route <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> using a tubular joint <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in one end and has a cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a trap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in this order from the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> side. The suction apparatus <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is attached to the other end of the gas discharge route <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and comprises a suction pump <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a gas meter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in this order. The suction pump <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a flow rate adjusting function and is possible to be used continuously for 24 hours or longer. The gas meter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is for measuring the flow rate of the sample gas and is capable of measuring the flow rate in a range of 10 to 40 l/min with accuracy of 0.1 l/min level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Next, the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to be employed for the above-described collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be described in details. The sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is of a molded body having a three-dimensional mesh structure and a fluid-permeability (in this example, a gas-permeability). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The molded body composing the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> contains fibers (a group of fibers) and an inorganic binder. The fibers to be employed in this case are those which do not substantially cause chemical reactions with the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins, their precursor, and coplanar PCBs. Examples of the fibers include fibrous activated carbon, carbon fiber, glass fiber, alumina fiber (especially activated alumina fiber), silica fiber, and Teflon fiber. These fibers may be used solely or in combination of two or more types of them. The fiber diameter and the specific surface area of the fibers are not particularly restricted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the average aspect ratio (the length/the diameter) of the fibers may 10,000 or lower, especially preferably 1,000 to 10,000. If the average aspect ratio of the fibers exceeds 10,000, the pressure loss increases during the time of sampling a sample fluid (a sample gas) to possibly result in incapability of isokinetic suction standardized according to the above-described JIS standards (JIS K 0311:1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the inorganic binder contained in the molded body has a property for binding the fibers to one another to integrate a group of the fibers and give a prescribed molding shape to the group of fibers, that is, has a function as a binder for maintaining the prescribed molding shape of the group of fibers. To say more practically in this embodiment, it is for setting the group of fibers to be the shape of said sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in other word, a cylindrical shape with closed one end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An inorganic binder usable in this case is not particularly restricted if it has said properties and does not substantially cause chemical reactions with the fibers as well as chlorinated organic compounds, however those having an adsorbing capability, especially a chlorinated organic compounds-adsorbing capability are preferable. As such a inorganic binder having adsorbing capability, examples are alumina (especially, activated alumina), zeolites, silicon dioxide (silica), acidic white clay, apatites and the like. The respective inorganic binders may be used solely or in combination of two or more of them. Further, although the form of the inorganic binders is not specifically restricted, generally, those with a granular shape are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In this case, the zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicates having a general formula, X<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2n</subscript></highlight>.sH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, and in the general formula, the reference character X denotes Na, Ca or K; the reference character Y denotes Si&plus;Al, respectively; and the reference character S is not constant. As such zeolites, synthetic zeolites are preferable to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Among said inorganic binders, in this invention, those having a tar-adsorbing capability are especially preferable. If inorganic binders having such characteristics are used, the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can effectively adsorb tar (details of it will be described later), for example, produced and derived from carbon monoxide contained in the sample gas and accordingly reliably collect and sample the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs dissolved in the tar. Incidentally, examples of the inorganic binders capable of adsorbing tar include alumina, zeolites and silicon dioxide. As the alumina, activated alumina is especially preferable to be used. These inorganic binders capable of adsorbing tar may be used solely or in combination of two or more of them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The molded body containing the above-described fibers and inorganic binder is preferable to have a bulk density preferably set to be 0.1 to 1 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, more preferably 0.3 to 0.7 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. If the bulk density of molded body is below 0.1 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, some of chlorinated organic compounds contained in the sample gas are sometimes passed through the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and that makes it difficult to carry out sampling of chlorinated organic compounds contained in the sampling gas without substantial leakage. Contrary, if the bulk density exceeds 1 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, the pressure loss is probably increased in the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> at the time of collecting the particulate substances contained in the sampling gas to possibly result in incapability of isokinetic suction standardized according to said JIS standards (JIS K 0311:1999). Further, in the extraction operation, which will be described later, for extracting the chlorinated organic compounds sampled by the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the extraction ratio is possibly decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The preferable molded body composing the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is those comprising activated alumina fibers as the fibers and a granular activated alumina as the inorganic binder. Especially, the most preferable one is such a molded body so formed as to have the bulk density in a range of 0.3 to 0.7 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the above-described molded body can be produced, for example, by the following manner. At first, a molding material containing the above-described fibers and inorganic binder is prepared. In this case, a dispersion containing an inorganic binder dispersed in water is produced and the fibers are added to the dispersion and the inorganic binder and the fibers are evenly mixed. At that time, the mixing ratio of the fibers and the inorganic binder is preferable to be adjusted properly so as to keep the bulk density of the aimed molded body within said range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Next, the obtained molding material is molded in a prescribed shape, that is, a one end-closed cylindrical shape to obtain a molded body. As the molding method employed in this case, a variety of well known molding methods, for example, a wet die molding method and the like may be employed. Then, the obtained molded body is sintered by heating to obtain the aiming molded body, that is, a sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The temperature at the time of sintering is not specifically restricted, however, in the case alumina is used for either one or both of the fibers and the inorganic binder, the temperature is preferable to be set in a range in which the alumina is activated and converted into activated alumina, that is, practically 150 to 700&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The molded body produced in the manner as described above may further be immersed in an aqueous dispersion containing an inorganic binder dispersed in water and then dried. If such treatment is carried out for the molded body, the molded body is impregnated with the inorganic binder and a molded body containing the inorganic binder in a larger amount can be produced. Further, by way of such treatment, the bulk density of the molded body can be adjusted to be within said preferable range. Since the inorganic binder is consequently contained in a large quantity by such treatment, in the case of using an inorganic binder having said tar-adsorbing capability, the chlorinated organic compounds contained in the sample gas can be collected without, leakage even if a large quantity of unburned hydrocarbons, which will be described later, and carbon monoxide are contained in the sample gas. Incidentally, the drying method for the molded body is not particularly restricted, generally, it is preferable to employ a method for removing water by heating the molded body at 150 to 700&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, a use method of the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, that is, a sampling method of chlorinated organic compounds using the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will be described. In this embodiment, the description will be regarding a case of sampling a sample gas from a waste gas flowing in a space in incineration facilities for incinerating wastes, for example, flowing in a flue duct and sampling the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs. In this case, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the tip end of the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is inserted into a flue duct <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> from a sampling port <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed in the flue duct <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. At that time, a packing <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is attached to the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to air-tightly seal the gap between the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the sampling port <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Further, a temperature measuring apparatus <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> such as a thermometer and a thermocouple is installed in the branch route <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In such a state, the suction pump <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is operated to carry out isokinetic suction of some of the waste gas flowing in the flue duct <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> into the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At that time, the isokinetic suction amount is calculated by measuring the temperature, the flow rate, the pressure, and the water amount in the waste gas flowing in the flue duct <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> according to JIS Z 8808 and based on the calculation results, the suction flow rate by the suction pump <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is controlled. The flow rate set in this case is preferable to be properly monitored by a gas meter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and properly adjusted as to continuously keep the isokinetic suction state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The sampled gas flowing into the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cooled by the cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and generally cooled to the temperature not higher than the dioxins production temperature, for example, to 120&deg; C. or lower. Consequently, generation of new dioxins can be prevented in the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The cooled sampled gas then flows into the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> after passing through the introduction pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The sampled gas flowing into the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> flows out to the main body unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> after passing through the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> as shown by the arrow in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and flows toward an aspirator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> after passing through the discharge route <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>At that time, a various soot and dust and various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs in both particulate and gaseous forms and contained in the sampled gas are simultaneously collected by said fibers and the inorganic binder and sampled from the sampled gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the case a large quantity of carbon compounds such as unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (CO) are contained in the sampled gas, tar derived from the carbon compounds is easy to be produced in the sampled gas. In many cases, the tar dissolves the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs therein and takes them inside. For that, if a filter employing an inorganic binder having no tar-adsorbing capability, for example, a filter made of a molded body produced by molding the above-described fibers using an organic binder such as a cellulose type binder is employed as the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the filter cannot efficiently collect the tar produced in the sampled gas and consequently, some of tar contained in the sampled gas possibly passes through the filter and leaks to the outside. That is, the chlorinated organic compounds dissolved in the tar are possibly discharged to the outside together with some of the tar without being sampled by the filter. That is a phenomenon which inventors of the present invention have found in the process of developing the invention and if the amount of the unburned hydrocarbons is judged using carbon monoxide as an index, especially, in the case the carbon monoxide concentration in the sampled gas exceeds 150 ppm, it is found that tar considerably passes through. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment, in the case the filter is made of a molded body containing the above-described fibers and an inorganic binder having tar-adsorbing capability, can collect tar contained in a sampled gas substantially without leakage even if the concentration of the unburned carbon compounds in the sampled gas is high (for example, even in the case the concentration of carbon monoxide in the sampled gas exceeds 150 ppm). In other words, the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can collect and sample the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs in both particulate and gaseous forms contained in the sampled gas substantially without leakage, regardless of the degree of the concentration of the unburned hydrocarbons in the sampled gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As described above, the sampled gas from which soot and dust and the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds in particulate and gaseous forms are removed by the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> substantially without leakage continuously flows toward the aspirator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the discharge route <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>At that time, the temperature of the sampled gas flowing in the discharge route <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is measured by the temperature measuring apparatus <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> installed in the branch route <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The sampled gas discharged out the discharge route <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>flows in the gas discharge route <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and further cooled by the cooling apparatus <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Consequently, water contained in the sampled gas is condensed and stored in the trap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The sampled gas from which water is removed in such a manner is discharged to the outside from the gas meter <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>after passing through the suction pump <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Incidentally, sampling of a sample gas, that is a waste gas, by the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out generally for a duration corresponding to the waste gas amount estimated from the detection limit value of the chlorinated organic compounds (generally, a waste gas of 1 to 3 Nm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>/3 to 4 hours). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the case of analysis of the concentration of the chlorinated organic compounds contained in the gas (a waste gas) sampled in such a manner, the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is detached from the flue duct <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is isolated from the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Further, the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is detached from the isolated collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Then, the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the introduction pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and the holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are washed using a solvent and the washing liquid at that time is kept. On the other hand, the chlorinated organic compounds collected by the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are extracted by a solvent. In this case, the extraction operation of the chlorinated organic compounds collected by the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be carried out by, for example, a common Soxhlet extractor. However the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be housed in a cell of a high speed extractor if it is set in a small size as described above and using the high speed extractor, the extraction operation can quickly be carried out. Further, the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> does not require the extraction conditions to be set specially in order to shorten the extraction time if the bulk density of the molded body composing the filter is set within the said range and the collected chlorinated organic compounds can be dissolved in the solvent quickly within a short time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> At the time of analysis of the chlorinated organic compounds, the above-described washing liquid and the extraction solution obtained by the extraction operation as described above are mixed and subjected to the analysis operation. In this case, as the analysis method, for example, methods employing gas chromatographic mass spectroscopy (GC/MS method) may be employed according to a method disclosed in, &ldquo;Standard measurement and analysis manual for dioxins in waste treatment&rdquo; edited by Environment assessment section, City water environment division, Life hygiene bureau of the Ministry of Health and Welfare Japan (published in March 1997, by Foundation of Waste Research and Investigation) or a method standardized by Japanese Industrial Standards JIS K 0311: 1999 (formulated on Sep. 20, 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In the case another sample gas is sampled using the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, for example, the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is replaced with a new one. In this case, since the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be employed for the next gas sampling by sufficiently washing only the sampling pipe <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the preparatory work before sampling a sample gas is significantly made easy as compared with that carried out using a conventional impinger and the time taken to sample the sample gas can considerably be shortened and the cost for sampling the sample gas can greatly be lowered. Further, since the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, especially the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is simple in the constitution as compared with a conventional complicated sampling apparatus, so that it is easy to handle and transport. For that, using the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a sampling work of a sample gas can be carried out easily even in a flue duct where it is difficult to install a conventional large size sampling apparatus using an impinger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> used once can be re-used repeatedly by sufficiently washing the holder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the introduction pipe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and replacing the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> with a new one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The invention can be modified as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (1) Although a cylindrical filter is used as the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the above-described embodiment, the invention is not restricted to that. For example, the invention can be carried out in the same manner in the case the sampling filter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is formed into a column-like or a disk-like shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> (2) Although in the above-described embodiment, description is given regarding the case of sampling the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs contained in a waste gas (a sample gas) discharged out an incinerator of wastes, the sampling filter, the sampling apparatus, and the sampling method of the invention may be employed in the same manner also in the case of sampling the chlorinated organic compounds contained in a fluid other than the waste gas. For example, the sampling filter and the like of the invention may be used in the same manner in the case of sampling the chlorinated organic compounds contained in the atmospheric air and the chlorinated organic compounds contained in water such as industrial wastewater, seawater, freshwater, and tap water and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in the case of sampling the chlorinated organic compounds contained in water such as industrial water, the target sample is a liquid sample. In this case, the liquid sample possibly contains various types of the chlorinated organic compounds in particulate state, foam state (that is, gas-liquid mixed state), and dissolved state (that is, dissolved-in-water state), the sampling filter of the invention can simultaneously collect the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds in a variety of such states and sample them from the liquid sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the invention will be described in greater detail according to the examples. Here, for the sake of understanding, at first comparative examples will be described and then examples will be described. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Comparative Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Coal based fibrous activated carbon with the average fiber diameter of 4 &mgr;m in 5% by weight and carbon fiber with the average fiber diameter of 13 &mgr;m in 95% by weight were mixed and a cellulose-based binder was added to obtain a molding material. The obtained molding material was molded into a one end-closed cylindrical shape and the resulting molded body was heated to dry the cellulose-based binder. Consequently, a cylindrical molded body (a sampling filter) having the weight of 2.3 g and the bulk density of 0.11 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>was obtained which was so adjusted as to have the outer diameter of 19 mm in the opening end side, the outer diameter of 18 mm in the closed end side, the thickness of 5 mm, and the length of 20 mm, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Using the obtained sampling filter, a collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for the chlorinated organic compounds according to the above-described embodiment was produced. Using the collector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the above-described embodiment was produced. A sample gas (a waste gas) was sampled from a flue duct of an incinerator during incineration of wastes using the sampling apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to sample the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and coplanar PCBs contained in the sample gas. The sampling conditions of the sample gas were adjusted as the conditions standardized by the JIS K 0311: 1999. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Simultaneously, the sample gas (the waste gas) was sampled from the same flue duct in the same conditions using a sample gas sampling apparatus equipped with an impinger (hereinafter referred as to an apparatus exemplified in JIS formulation) to sample the various types of the chlorinated organic compounds such as dioxins and the coplanar PCBs contained in the sample gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The sampled chlorinated organic compounds were extracted by the method according to JIS K 0311: 1999 and quantitatively analyzed according to the analysis method standardized in the same JIS standards. As a result, in the case the average concentration of carbon monoxide in the sample gas was 150 ppm or lower, the amount of the chlorinated organic compounds sampled by the sampling apparatus employing the sampling filter of this comparative example was found different from the amount of the chlorinated organic compounds sampled by the apparatus exemplified in JIS formulation by 3% but substantially same as that sampled by the apparatus exemplified in JIS formulation. On the other hand, in the case the average concentration of carbon monoxide in the sample gas was 510 ppm, the amount of the chlorinated organic compounds sampled by the sampling apparatus employing the sampling filter of this comparative example was found only 85% to the amount of the chlorinated organic compounds sampled by the apparatus exemplified in JIS formulation. Consequently, if the carbon monoxide concentration in the sample gas increased, in other words, if the concentration of unburned carbon compounds increased in the sample gas, the sampling filter of the comparative example was found difficult to collect some of chlorinated organic compounds contained in the sample gas. </paragraph>

The obtained molding material was molded into a one end-closed cylindrical shape and the resulting molded body was heated to dry the cellulose-based binder. Consequently, a cylindrical molded body (a sampling filter) having the weight of 2.5 g and the bulk density of 0.13 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>was obtained which was so adjusted as to have the same sizes as those of Comparative example 1. </paragraph>
