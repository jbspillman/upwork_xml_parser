<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A diaphragmatic (planar) electrocoustic transducer forms a complete sound radiating transducer, with high efficiency and linearity. An easily exchangeable and rectangular in shape diaphragm, of very thin polyamide film is made with a plurality of aluminum conductors formed on one side of said diaphragm. The diaphragm with the plurality of conductors form two identical and symmetrical coils which are the one, inside the other, in an order, that conductors of each coil are interlaced. The two sections of the coils are disposed in dense air-gaps of the magnet system, which comprises a plurality of high (BHmax) Neodymium magnets. The binary interlaced coils can be utilized in a number of modes, for the purpose of accomplishing a variety of operating modes, such as: 1. A series connection provides a higher sensitivity compared to single coil (2). A parallel connection converts the transducer to a higher power standing devise (3). A single coil driving mode, leaves the other coil to be used as magnetic damping devise for the whole diaphragm (4). Moreover a single coil driving, allows the utilization of the other coil to be as source of correcting feedback circuitry (5). The symmetricity and the similarity of parameters of the two coils can be exploited in push-pull output stages for linearizing purposes (6). In addition the two coils cast be used in direct digital loudspeaker circuitry. The above described operating modes, are merely illustrative of the varied possibilities which may constitute applications of the invention&apos;s binary interlaced coil configuration. The binary interlaced coils of the present invention can be executed with a multiplictiy of such coils, laid on the same diaphragm, for accomplishing long line source loudspeaker. Such other application may be devised by those skilled in the art, exploiting the possibilities offered by the two identical and symmetrical coils. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to electroacoustic transducers which act as Loudspeakers and in particular to thin diaphragm type of Audio transducers, which are converting electrical (audio) energy, into movement of a sound emitting diaphragm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Such transducers which are called Planar Loudspeakers or some times as Ribbon Loudspeakers, in the past years were not enjoying the same popularity as the cone-type speakers &mdash;inspite of the superior performance of the said diaphragmatic types&mdash; due primarily their high cost, and the different performance characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The conventional, cone or dome Loudspeakers are known as electromagnetic motor actuated point sound source emitting devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As it is known to those skilled, in the art of sound reproduction, the &ldquo;pistonic&rdquo; operation of cones or domes is not at all secured throughout their operating range, and as a result not a uniform sound emitting activity can exist from the surface of cone or dome. Sound waves emitted from the peripheral portion of cone or dome may be out of phase to the emitted sound, from their central part areas, at any given instant. This is an inherent distorting characteristic of cone-dome Loudspeakers, created by the mode of activation and the shape of the activated sound emitting surfaces. An additional distortion producing factor, is the moving mass of cone or dome which has to be moved in accordance with the waveform of the audio current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The demands of the audio signal, can be so great in terms of moving speed and acceleration, that (the inertia mass) weight (mass) of the vibrating parts is a great limiting factor. As a result the reproduced waveform is greatly affected especially in high frequencies where the relative inertias cannot be met by the electromagnetic motor moving the heavy cones or domes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The above severe limitations, of the motor actuated Loudspeakers, such as kinetic sluggishness; shape and mass, are certainly, overcomed, by the thin diaphragm type of loudspeaker, which employ as sound emitting surface a diaphragm of greatly reduced mass and the moving force is applied on almost all the area of the vibrating diaphragm, thus realizing a true pistonic vibration action. The low mass of the diaphragm obeys the commands of the audio waveform with exceptional ease and the acoustic results are extreme fidelity, and transparency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Numerous type of such planar speakers can be found, being used in Hi Fi systems, giving very satisfactory acoustic results. Most of the planar transducers existing in commercial production today make use of Polyester or Polyimid diaphragm which has on its surface laminated a very thin layer of parallel aluminum current carrying conductors. The said diaphragm is evenly stretched over rows of magnets, the magnetic lines of which, intersect the diaphragm with current currying conductors at 90&deg;. The interaction of the magnetic lines and the magnetic field created by the current flowing the conductors, results in a force, moving either forward or backward the diaphragm in accordance with the direction &mdash;at any instant&mdash; of the flowing audio current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, the diaphragm with the current carrying conductors is the motor and the sound emitting member of the Planar loudspeaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Such planar loudspeakers are characterized by distinct advantages in performance over the cone-dome loudspeakers. Planar loudspeakers exhibit, wider bandwidth, Linear phase response, constant impedance, greatly improved transient response and lower distortion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> All those operating advantages are the reasons of the acoustic superiority of Planars. Especially, with today&apos;s digital sources of audio reproduction such as CD, DVD-Audio, SACD (Super Audio CD), DAT etc. which place higher demands on the contemporary loudspeaker systems, the said advantages are invaluable. However all those acoustic benefits offered by planar magnetics are enjoyed by audiophiles, after paying the high cost, for the said loudspeakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The high cost of the planar loudspeakers is somehow anticipated, considering their distinct acoustic merits. The disappointment of the user comes, when the delicate vibrating diaphragm happens to fail, either by mechanical failure or by thermal failure of the coil. In such situation, all the rest expensive structure of the planar loudspeaker is wasted as laying inoperative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Invariably such planar Loudspeaker failures are not remediable by the user. Under the circumstances the magnetic structure and in fact the entire loudspeaker which has been paid dearly, becomes total waste. Even in the rare case of loudspeaker makers allowing return to factory for repair, the user must pay dearly for material, labor and transportation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Primary object of the present invention is to provide a planar sound reproducer with excellent performance characteristics, the values of which are secured, and maintained at all times by offering: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (A) The exchangeable diaphragm may carry multiplicity of binary interlaced coils. The advantages of the binary interlaced coils, of this invention, and their applications will be exposed extensively in the text to follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (B) An easy and simple way of replacing the diaphragm, by the user, in the filed, without the need to manipulate any wires and soldering-disordering tools in case of failure, or, in case of installing diaphragm with different characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (C) The exchangeable diaphragms in a variante of resistance&mdash;impedance characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (D) The whole surface of the binary interlaced coils being driven, in the true sense of word driven. In order that the present invention may be more fully understood, the made statements A, B, C, D will be elaborated and with the help of accompanying drawings fully elucidated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the present invention the replacement of the diaphragm is accomplished by the user in a very simple operation, without the need of manipulating wires or soldering- de-soldering means, as this is necessary in prior art equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, the diaphragm of commercial planar speakers employ for driving, single coil, in contrast, with the present invention which provides two (binary) interlaced coil, for simultaneous driving. In the present invention, in addition to the easy field replacement, the diaphragm is characterized by two symmetrical coils configuration, which are interlaced, in a manner of being the one into each other, thus occupying the same area of the said diaphragm and securing the fact that the two coils are absolutely identical with all electrical characteristics such as Resistance, Impedance, Inductance being absolutely equal. Such Binary Interlaced Coils can be laid, in a multiplicity of similar B.I.C. executions, on the same long diaphragm tensioning adjustment means, for obtaining desired low frequency operation. A long and slim loudspeaker embodying in its diaphragm a multiplicity of binary interlace coils, can lead to the design of full range hybrid speaker driver, with line source behavior. The two coils in the present invention are characterized by symmetricity and equality of their parameters, a condition which permit the creation of several combinations of impedance networks, which can act as the output loads of an amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is an objective of the present invention to provide to those skilled in the art of sound reproduction, the flexibility of connecting, in series the two coils for maximum sensitivity or in parallel for increased power capability. Additional connecting possibilities of the two coils are as follows:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition, the invention of binary symmetrical interlaced coils configuration can inspire and provide the means, to those skilled and wishing, to devise new applications such as: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A) DDL. Direct Digital Loudspeaker circuitry </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> B) Feedback optimizer circuitry </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> G) Other inventive applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An other object of the present invention is the character of the exchangeable diaphragm assembly and the way the totality of the coils conductors are energized by the magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the semicircular sections of the interlaced coils, which are at the two ends of the longitudinal axis of the diaphragm are not clamped, but free to move, and in addition the semicircular section of the conductors are intersected by the magnetic flux lines exactly as the linear section of the conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus effectively driving the semicircular sections, in strict accordance with the excursions of the linear sections, therefore the entire area of the coils is moving in a true pistonic action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The Amp{dot over (e)}re&apos;s Law for the force on a conductor, it asserts that any conductor of (L) length carrying a current (i) and located in a magnetic field (B) at right angle to the flux lines, will be pushed by a force (F) that is proportional to the flux density, to the current and to the length of the conductor. The above principle is mathematically expressed as: F&equals;BLi, F, B, i being vector quantities. This is the principle that governs the force which moves the diaphragms of all planar speakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In applying Amp{dot over (e)}re&apos;s Law, it should be noted that for any length (L) of conductor the directions F, B and i are mutually perpendicular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> FIG. (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) shows these directions along the three geometric axes, as the Law is examined in three points along a typical turn of our diaphragm, where is confirmed that the Force (F) has the same direction in the linear and the semicircular section of the conductor, thus the semicircular section is actively contributing in the sound emitting activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> By using <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> it is clearly shown that the Amp{dot over (e)}re&apos;s Law is applied in all the length (L) of our diaphragms conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The various diaphragmatic loudspeakers of prior art invariably have the extreme sections of their elongated coils, not actively participating in the force producing process, and in some cases they are clamped and immovable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With reference to a U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,610 titled: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Whole surface driven speaker&rdquo; assigned to Fostex corporation, Japan, the following comments should be made: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The claim of the title that the entire surface is &ldquo;driven&rdquo; does not seem correct, because there are sections of diaphragm coil extremities which actually are not driven and are not force producing sections, Those sections, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,610 are simply carried out by the rest of the active linear sections, which are force producing, obeying the Law F&equals;BLi.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With reference to drawings and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is shown all the main components; which compose the present invention and which are: the upper plate pole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the diaphragm assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the central pole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the side poles <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the Neodymium magnets <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which are required for the construction of diaphragmatic electroacoustic transducer in accordance with the present invention. The members <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are made of low carbon soft iron material <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the components <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, assembled and the created two air gaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, between upper plate pole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the central pole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the complete transducer assembly installed in its aluminium enclosure <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as indicated in Line A-A&prime; cut of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows in perspective view, the complete loudspeaker assembled and the two covers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> being in place, thus realizing the contact of each coil of the diaphragm, with the respective terminals <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outside of each plastic cover <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the upper plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is machined in highly polished surfaces for low magnetic losses when attached by six screws <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B to side poles <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Following this attachment of <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the Neodymium magnets <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> together with the central pole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, are put in place, with appropriate adhesive agent. This assembly procedure always takes care that the upper plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the South pole of the magnets and the central pole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is the North pole. By convention we consider that the direction of magnetic flux lines have a direction from N- to -S as indicated in the analysis of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> By referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and in particular to the groove <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the upper part of the central pole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it should be given the two reasons of the groove <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. At first the flux lines traversing the air gap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, are mostly departing from the two banks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, of the groove <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and, very few lines departing from the bed <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the groove. If the groove geometry is examined in conjunction with geometry of the two interlaced coils will be apparent that the central section of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, is not covered by coil conductors and therefore any lines intersecting that section are a waste. Also any lines reduced from departing the inner part of the groove <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the central pole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, are added to the useful part of flux lines departing from the groove banks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. An additional usefulness of the groove is the filling of the bed by a soft wool thread, which is &ldquo;overflowing&rdquo; the bed, and thus at extreme excursions of the diaphragm, the wool thread acts as acoustic bumper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> By referring <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to the pieces <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> assembled, the magnetic system is ready to accept the exchangeable diaphragm assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The diaphragm assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is inserted in its operating position by holding the frame from the side <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D and sliding the long sides <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C between the poles <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the short side <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B with the opening, better showing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, allowing the passage, without the thin part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A of the central pole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> being an obstacle. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, by screwing each <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A against the internal surface of the front part of the aluminium enclosure <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the upper pole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> squeezes a ferrous metal sheet <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which acts as magnetic shielding and at the same time it immobilizes the magnetic assembly inside the aluminium enclosure, by anchoring it in four different points <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A&times;4, as per <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In order to understand the automatic contacting of the external terminals <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the two coils <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the exchangeable diaphragm <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is necessary to review the functioning of the transducer covers <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Both covers are identical plastic pieces and are airtightly closing the inside of the loudspeaker. This is accomplished by providing a soft gasket material which is placed at the bottom of guiding groove <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The guiding groove <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is playing another role, which is riding on the edge of the aluminium enclosure during the closing operation, guides the cover to its final closing position, at which should be precisely making the electrical contact operation. The inside of each cover is characterized by the two spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the spring loaded contact carrier <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which is cross shaped and which is a copper clad material, as that used in printed circuit boards, of 2 mm thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The contact carrier <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is separated in two contacting copper areas <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A along its longitudinal dimension, on the one side having soldered the pair of gold plated contacts <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>C, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and on the other side are attached by soldering, one pair of flexible conductors <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the free ends of which are soldered on the inside riveting member of the terminals <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, supported on the outside of the cover plastic cover <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows by dashed lines the path or routing of the spring loaded contacts and the eventual contact with contact islands <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, which takes place at the end of the transducer covering operation. The spring compression of both covers, applied on each extremity of the diaphragm assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, through the contact islands <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A besides the electrical contact making action, they hold firmly the diaphragm assembly <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to its proper operating position. This position bring the two coils at 0.6 mm below the lower surface of upper plate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and 0.6 mm above the two banks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the central pole <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. With the help of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and the Amp{dot over (e)}rs law we shall expose the electromagnetic force F which is exerted on typical conductor turn of our coil, and prove that every part of the coil, linear and semicircular, is driven by a unidirectional force at any instant and that the whole coil surface is driven in strict accordance with the driving audio signal. The force F in dynes which drives the conductors of the two interlaced coils, is expressed in mathematical terms as: F&equals;BLi, where </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> B&equals;Flux density of magnetic lines in Kilo-Gauss, arrows <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> indicate the direction of flux lines </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> L&equals;the length of the conductors in Meters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> i&equals;the current in the coil in Amp{dot over (e)}rs arrows <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> indicate the direction of current in the conductor </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> F&equals;the force in dynes resulting from the interaction of B and i arrows. F indicates the direction of the force </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The quantities F, B, i are vectors and according to Amb{dot over (e)}r Law are mutually perpendicular. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the three vectors F, B, i along the three geometric axes, applied in points along the linear sections of the coil <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as well as the semicircular sections of the coil <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, where the perpendicularity of B and the direction of i is applied on the tangent on the application point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is clearly shown that with vectors B and i unchanged in direction, at any instant, the resulting force vector F, as applied in three different points on a coil &apos;s conductor turn, is of the same direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It is therefore clear that the whole surface which is covered by the two interlaced coils are moving by force F in exact accordance with the audio signal, pistonically. </paragraph>
