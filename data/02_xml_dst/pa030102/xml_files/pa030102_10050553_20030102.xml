<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a charge collecting system which notifies the user of requested contents on a network and enables the user side to settle an account of the requested contents on the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, to collect charges in mail-order sales or collect monthly service charges for telephone charges or subscription of magazines, a bill of the charge is mailed to the user and the user side performs a transfer to a bank/a money transfer or payment at a convenience store on the basis of the bill. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, on the industrial company side which collects the service charges, issuance costs and mail costs of the bills which are issued to the users are very large, resulting in obstruction of a cost reduction. Also on the user side, he has to go out of his way to a financial institution or a convenience store for the purpose of paying. He is apt to forget the payment due to such a troublesomeness. Thus, even the industrial company side has to issue the bill to the user side again. Such a situation also becomes a factor of increasing the costs. There is also a problem such that since receipts of money are uncertain, a trade account receivable is large. Moreover, even when there are receipts of money, there are various factors of obstructing the cost reduction, that is, a factor such that the receipts of money and a request have to be manually confirmed, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As means for solving such a problem, in case of a sale of goods or the like on the Internet, there is a method whereby requested contents are prepared on a screen and the user side prints such a screen image and makes payment at the convenience store or the like by using the screen image in place of a transfer sheet or the like. According to such a method, however, the user side has to print the requested contents, write predetermined items onto a printed paper, and subsequently go to the convenience store or the like. A burden on the user side further increases or the like. Such a method is not a fundamental solving measure. </paragraph>

The notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is realized by the Web server and AP server. Further, the requested contents notice unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is realized by the mail server. The settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is realized by the POS server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Further in detail, the computer for each server executes a control program corresponding to the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so that the units <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a wallet server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected to the network. The wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> provides a wallet (server wallet function) having a function as a virtual electronic wallet on the network to the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and provides services regarding the settling process which is executed to the user by the settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a financial institution such as a bank for making the Internet debit settlement and is a settlement institution which has an account of the user and an account of the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and executes a payment transaction process for paying from the user to the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The network <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is, for example, an Internet and is a network for mutually connecting the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> &lt;Operation&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The operation of the charge collecting system according to the invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> First, a case where the system is applied to a sales method of a deferred payment of the user whereby use by the user is managed every predetermined period such as &ldquo;monthly&rdquo; and a charged money amount for this period is determined on a predetermined closing date will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Operation of System in Deferred Payment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> First, the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> registers his own mail address on the Internet into the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when he performs a transaction with the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> For example, the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has his own account in the settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and preliminarily makes a use contract of the Internet debit settlement by using the wallet service of the wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. For example, the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a virtual shop which has a homepage of sales goods on the Internet and accepts the purchase of the goods on the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sequence chart showing the operation in case of the deferred payment in the embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The user purchases goods from the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by using the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). Thus, the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is notified of the purchase information by the notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The user has been registered in the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> discriminates whether the user is an authorized person who is permitted to purchase the goods or not. If a discrimination result indicates OK, the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> notifies the notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of acknowledgment information (step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is notified of the acknowledgment information from the notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). If it is NG (No good), the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is notified of unavailable information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> By those operations, when the user purchases goods on the homepage, a message &ldquo;Thank you for buying. The goods will be delivered in xx days.&rdquo; showing a deal of purchase is displayed on the screen of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After that, the sales goods are delivered to the user by another unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> manages the use by the user as mentioned above by user information management database (DB). When the closing date determined by the user comes, the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> forms a list of requested contents of that month and notifies the notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and requested contents notice unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the list of the requested contents (step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). The notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> forms the requested contents in correspondence to the URL prepared every user, and the requested contents notice unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> transmits the requested contents and his own URL to the mail address of the user (step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an explanatory diagram showing a relation between the contents displayed on the screen of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in (a) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the Email of the requested contents and the URL for payment provided for each user are notified. The URL can be accessed by selecting this portion. In case of paying, the user selects the URL (step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). Information of the charged money amount and the like has been prepared and the requested contents as shown in (b) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are displayed on the screen of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the user selects &ldquo;EXECUTE&rdquo; on such a screen (steps S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> makes the Internet debit settlement to the settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by using the wallet services of the wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). That is, the user selects &ldquo;EXECUTE&rdquo; on such a screen shown in (b) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, so that a log-in of the wallet of the user is performed and the Internet debit settlement is made via a process such as a predetermined account balance confirmation which is executed in the settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. If withdrawal of a money amount from the account of the user to the account of the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is OK, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is notified of the fact that the settlement has been completed from the settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> receives a settlement completion notice, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> notifies the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the information indicative of the completion of the settlement (step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). The notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> displays a message &ldquo;Thank you for payment&rdquo; onto the screen of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) as shown in (c) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> notified of the settlement completion information from the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> clears the request balance of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a case where the system according to the invention is applied to a prepayment sales method whereby a predetermined money amount is collected from the user and, thereafter, goods are provided to the user for a predetermined period of time will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Operation of system in prepayment&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> First, in a manner similar to the case of the foregoing operation of the deferred payment, when making a transaction with the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> registers his own mail address on the Internet into the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For example, the user has his own account in the settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and previously makes a use contract of the Internet debit settlement by using the wallet services of the wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment, the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a virtual shop for distributing contents such as music and images on the Internet on a unit basis of a predetermined period such as month or year. It is assumed that the user has already paid the charge for the predetermined period to the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and received the service of the contents distribution therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a sequence chart showing the operation in case of the prepayment according to the embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> manages an available period to the user. When a termination date of the available period approaches, the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> forms a list of the requested contents to the user and notifies the notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and requested contents notice unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the list (step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). The notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> forms the requested contents in correspondence to the URL prepared every user. On the other hand, the requested contents notice unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> transmits the requested contents and the URL to the mail address of the user by Email (step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). Although contents of the Email are fundamentally similar to those shown in (a) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, they are different from those in the foregoing example with respect to the point such that a message &ldquo;use charges of this year will be informed&rdquo; regarding the prepayment is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> When this Email is received, the user selects the URL included in the Email (step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). The information such as a charged money amount and the like has been prepared in the URL. Contents of the use charges of this year are displayed on the screen of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Thus, the user issues a paying instruction from the terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (steps S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). The settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> makes the Internet debit settlement to the settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by using the wallet service of the wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the user (step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). The operation in this case is similar to that in case of the deferred payment mentioned above. If the payment from the account of the user to that of the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is OK, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is notified of the fact that the settlement has been completed by the settlement institution <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Thus, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> notifies the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the information indicative of the completion of the settlement (step S<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>). The notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> displays a message &ldquo;thank you for payment&rdquo; onto the screen of the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> notified of the information showing the settlement completion by the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> updates the information of the use period to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> After that, when there is a contents use instruction from the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>), if the notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> receives this information, the use information management unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> discriminates whether the use period is an available period to the user or not with reference to the use information management database and notifies the notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a result (available/unavailable) (step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>). If the discrimination result shows &ldquo;available&rdquo;, the notice information management unit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> displays a message showing that the contents is available onto the screen of the terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After that, the contents is distributed by a contents distributing unit (not shown) (step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). If the contents is unavailable, a message showing it is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> &lt;Effects&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, according to the embodiment, the user is notified of the requested contents by the Email, and when the user access the URL of every user included in the Email and instructs the payment, the Internet debit settlement is made, so that the following effects are obtained on the user side and the sales shop side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Effects on the user side&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> There is no need to go to the financial institution or convenience store for the purpose of paying, and the user can easily pay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Even the user who does not use a credit card can easily use the present system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In case of the sales such that the paying process is executed after the goods were purchased, since the user can pay after confirming the goods, the mail-order sale can be used at rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The cheap goods which can be accomplished by the introduction of the present system and are realized by the cost reduction on the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side can be purchased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Effects on the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Since the bill is transmitted by Email, the issuance and mail costs of the bill can be remarkably reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Since the processes such that (the Email is transmitted)&rarr;(the user who received the Email instructs the payment)&rarr;(the real-time settlement) are executed in an extremely short period, the period of time which is used until the receipts of money is short, so that a trade account receivable decreases, and a cash flow can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Since a confirmation is made simultaneously with that the user makes the settlement, a manual confirming process can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> For example, in addition to the conventional payment by the transfer to the bank, since the number of settlement units which can be selected by the user such that the payment by the present system is prepared and the like increases, the number of business chances can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Since the costs can be reduced in terms of various points such that the issuance and mail costs of the bill and the trade account receivable decrease, and the like, the low price of the goods can be realized, so that a customer collecting ratio can be further improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> According to the sale such that the requesting process is executed after the goods were sold, even if there is a cancellation before the user pays, a troublesomeness for a refundment of the charges and a settlement commission can be omitted, so that it is possible to also sufficiently cope with cooling-off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> &lt;Modifications&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Although the embodiment has been described with respect to the case where the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the virtual shop for making a commercial transaction on the Internet, the sales method is not limited to such a virtual shop. The system of the present invention can be applied to payment of sales in actual shops and also applied to any type of industry. The goods to be dealt can be also books, groceries, clothes, CDs, video tapes, life miscellaneous goods, special products, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Further, particularly, a large effect can be obtained in the case where the system of the invention is applied to a settlement of charges for managing the use period, such as telephone charges, monitoring charges, rent, subscription charges, utility charges, insurance premium, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, the settlement unit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for making the Internet debit settlement by the SET settlement has been provided for the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, for example, in a system such that the wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has the POS server and requests a process from the POS function (POS client) on the sales shop <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> side, the settlement unit can be also realized by using the POS server of such a wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment, although the wallet service providing company <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has provided the function for making the Internet debit settlement, the settlement unit can be also realized by preparing the wallet function on the user terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Further, although the Internet debit settlement has been used as a settlement unit in the embodiment, other. various settlements which are made on the Internet, for example, a credit settlement, a settlement using prepaid-type electronic money, and the like can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiment but many modifications and variations are possible within the spirit and scope of the appended claims of the invention. </paragraph>
