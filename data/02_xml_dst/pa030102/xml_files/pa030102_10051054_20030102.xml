<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A driver circuit generates two control signals that change from low to high as an input signal changes from high to low, and change from high to low as the input signal changes from low to high. The driver circuit also generates another two control signals that change from high to low as the input signal changes from high to low, and change from low to high as the input signal changes from low to high. The driver circuit applies these four control signals to gate terminals of four MOS transistors. Timings of logical level changes of these four control signals are controlled so as to generate a period in which the four MOS transistors are simultaneously turned on or off. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a differential output circuit based on the conventional art. This differential output circuit comprises two n-channel MOS transistors (hereafter called nMOS transistor) M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, two p-channel MOS transistors (hereafter called pMOS transistor) M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, two constant current sources J<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, J<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and drivers IN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, BU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and BU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The drivers IN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, IN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, BU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and BU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receive a common input signal X to generate control signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be applied to respective gate electrodes of the MOS transistors M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the input signal X is at a low level (hereafter called L level), the transistors M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned on, while the transistors M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are turned off. Conversely, when the input signal X is at a high level (hereafter called H level), the transistors M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned off, while the transistors M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are turned on. Accordingly, logical signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in opposite phases to each other are output from nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The output signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are transferred to circuits of another semiconductor chip through respective transmission paths <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A resistor R is connected between the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to perform a function as a terminator resistor with respect to the transmission paths <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Each of the drivers IN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a CMOS inverter circuit that outputs an inverted logic of an input signal X. Each of the drivers BU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of two CMOS inverter circuits connected in series, and is a buffer circuit for outputting the same logic as that of an input signal X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows respective waveforms of the control signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the output signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Assume that the drivers IN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have changed from an H level to an L level at a time s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in response to a change of an input signal X from an L level to an H level. Because of the difference of configuration of the drivers BU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and BU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from that of the drivers IN<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and IN<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the signals B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> change from the L level to the H level at a time s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is later than the time s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes from an on state to an off state and the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> changes from an off state to an on state in response to level changes of the signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the time s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, respectively, and the voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> then rises from the L level. On the other hand, the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> remains in the off state and the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> remains in the on state until the time s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is reached. Therefore, the potential on the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also rises through the resistor R according to rising of the voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the MOS transistors M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> change to the on state and the off state, respectively, in response to level changes of the signals B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the time s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> drops. In response to the drop, the voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> momentarily drops through the resistor R, but the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is driven by the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the high voltage again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When the signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> change from the L level to the H level at a time s<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in response to a change of the input signal X from the H level to the L level, the signals B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> change from the H level to the L level at a time s<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that is later than the time s<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes from the off state to the on state and the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> changes from the on state to the off state in response to level changes of the signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the time s<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> drops from the H level. On the other hand, the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> remains in the on state and the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> remains in the off state until the time s<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is reached. Therefore, the potential on the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also drops through the resistor R according to drop of the voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> changes to the off state and the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> changes to the on state in response to level changes of the signals B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the time s<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively, and the voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rises. The voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> momentarily rises through the resistor R according to rising of the voltage on the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is driven by the MOS transistor M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the low voltage again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As explained above, the control signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are generated so that response of the signals B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the input signal X is delayed as compared to response of the signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Resultantly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an overshoot that momentarily exceeds the voltage at the H level and an undershoot that momentarily drops lower than the voltage at the L level occur in the output signal Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in response to logical level changes of the input signal X. Further, a portion D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that momentarily drops its waveform and a portion D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that momentarily raises its waveform occur in the output signal Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The distortions of these waveforms are caused by occurrence of a period in which both of the MOS transistors M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned off simultaneously when both of the MOS transistors M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned on or by occurrence of a period in which both of the MOS transistors M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are turned off simultaneously when both of the MOS transistors M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned on according to level changes of the input signal X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Such distortions in the output waveforms of the output signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are not merely an apparent problem but become a problem in terms of signal propagation property. For example, although the terminator resistor R is provided, the signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are reflected to a certain extent by the respective ends of the transmission paths <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The reflection of the distorted portions of the waveforms causes to further disturb the waveforms of the output signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, signals having proper waveforms may not be transferred to their destinations. Further, if there are other transmission paths adjacent to the transmission paths l and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, wiring capacity between the transmission paths <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the adjacent transmission paths may cause so-called cross talk noise that the distortions of these waveforms cause noise to occur on other adjacent transmission paths. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide a semiconductor integrated circuit that suppresses waveform distortions of output signals when logical levels of the output signals are changed in accordance with an input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor integrated circuit according to one aspect of this invention comprises a first MOS transistor of a first conductivity type having a drain terminal connected to a first node; a second MOS transistor of a second conductivity type different from the first conductivity type, having a drain terminal connected to said first node; a third MOS transistor of the first conductivity type having a drain terminal connected to a second node and a source terminal connected to a source terminal of said first MOS transistor; a fourth MOS transistor of the second conductivity type having a drain terminal connected to said second node and a source terminal connected to a source terminal of said second MOS transistor; and a driver circuit which generates first to fourth control signals whose logical levels change in response to a common input signal, and applies the signals to respective gate terminals of said first to fourth MOS transistors. In this structure, the first control signal starts to change from a low level to a high level at a first time in response to a first level change of the input signal from a high level to a low level, and starts to change from the high level to the low level at a second time in response to a second level change of the input signal from the low level to the high level. The second control signal starts to change from a low level to a high level at a third time, that is later than the first time, in response to the first level change of the input signal, and starts to change from the high level to the low level at a fourth time, that is earlier than the second time, in response to the second level change of the input signal. The third control signal starts to change from a high level to a low level at a fifth time in response to the first level change of the input signal, and starts to change from the low level to the high level at a sixth time in response to the second level change of the input signal. The fourth control signal starts to change from a high level to a low level at a seventh time, that is earlier than the fifth time, in response to the first level change of the input signal, and starts to change from the low level to the high level at an eighth time, that is later than the sixth time, in response to the second level change of the input signal. Moreover, at least a portion of a period between the first and second times and at least a portion of a period between the fifth and sixth times overlap one another, and at least a portion of a period between the third and fourth times and at least a portion a period between the seventh and eighth times overlap one another. </paragraph>

This driver circuit generates first and second control signals each of which changes from a low level to a high level in response to a first level change of an input signal from a high level to a low level, and changes from the high level to the low level in response to a second level change of the input signal from the low level to the high level; and third and fourth control signals each of which changes from a high level to a low level in response to the first level change of the input signal, and changes from the low level to the high level in response to the second level change of the input signal. The driver circuit applies the first to fourth control signals to respective gate terminals of said first to fourth MOS transistors. The driver circuit includes at least one first logic circuit consisting of a first delay circuit that is connected to a node whose voltage at its input changes in response to a voltage change of the input signal and delays the voltage change at the input to be output; and a NAND logic gate whose first inputis connected to the input of said first delay circuit, and whose second input is connected to the output of said first delay circuit, and which outputs a NAND logic; and at least one second logic circuit consisting of a second delay circuit that is connected to a node whose voltage at its input changes in response to a voltage change of the input signal and delays the voltage change at the input to be output; and a NOR logic gate whose first input is connected to the input of said second delay circuit, and whose second input is connected to the output of said second delay circuit, and which outputs a NOR logic. The driver circuit generates the first to fourth control signals based on the NAND logic output from at least one first logic circuit and the NOR logic output from at least one second logic circuit. </paragraph>

Conversely, even if the potential on the node N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> rises, this rise does not further push up the potential on the node N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the H level through the resistor R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the output signal Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes from the L level to the H level without occurrence of an undershoot and the output signal Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> changes from the H level to the L level without occurrence of an overshoot according to a change of the input signal X from the L level to the H level. Thus, it is possible to suppress waveform distortions of the output signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the first embodiment, the control signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are generated so that all the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned on according to level change of the signal X. This works so as to suppress an overshoot and an undershoot occurring in the output signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> without generation of a period in which only the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are turned on or only the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned on. It is therefore possible to avoid waveform distortions such as overshoots and undershoots, which have been seen in the conventional art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the first embodiment, the output signals of the logic circuits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be changed so as to be applied to respective gate terminals of the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this case, there occurs a period in which all the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned off even in either of changes of the signal X from the L level to the H level and from the H level to the L level. For example, it is assumed that the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are ON, the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are ON, and the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are at the L level and the H level, respectively. When the logical level of the input signal X changes, all of the four MOS transistors are turned off. This situation does not bring about such a state that only the MOS transistors MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned on or only the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned on, so that waveform distortions, which have been seen in the conventional art, can be avoided. However, when all the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned on, the nodes N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are brought to a floating state. In this case, attention must be paid to the possibility that noise may occur due to external factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Further, it is preferable that a delay by the transfer gate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> coincides with a response delay of the inverter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. If there is no coincidence between the delays, respective timings of level changes between the control signals A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and timings of level changes between the control signals A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> do not coincide with each other. However, the delay by the transfer gate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the response delay of the inverter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be allowed to differ from each other to the extent of insuring two cases as follows. (1) To overlap, on a time basis, between a portion of a period from the time at which the control signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> starts to change from the L level to the H level until the time at which the control signal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> starts to change from the L level to the H level, and a portion of a period from the time at which the control signal B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> starts to change from the H level to the L level until the time at which the control signal B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> starts to change from the H level to the L level. (2) To overlap, on a time basis, between a portion of a period from the time at which the control signal A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> starts to change from the H level to the L level until the time at which the control signal A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> starts to change from the H level to the L level, and a portion of a period from the time at which the control signal B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> starts to change from the L level to the H level until the time at which the control signal B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> starts to change from the L level to the H level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Even in this case, a period in which the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are simultaneously turned on occurs in association with logical level changes of the input signal X. However, it is possible to avoid the state where only the MOS transistors MA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and MA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned on or only the MOS transistors MB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and MB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are turned on, which has occurred in the conventional art. Accordingly, overshoots and undershoots or the like on the output signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be suppressed to some extent as compared to the conventional art, thus reducing waveform distortions of the output signals. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the driver circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the output signals Y<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Y<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> do not bring about an overshoot and an undershoot even if the logical level of the input signal X changes like the first embodiment.

In this semiconductor integrated circuit, control signals applied to the respective gate terminals of the first to fourth MOS transistors generate a period in which all the first to fourth MOS transistors are turned on or off in response to logical level changes of the input signal.
