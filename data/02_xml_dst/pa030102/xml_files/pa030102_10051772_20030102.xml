<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of vehicle data communications and, more particularly, to data communications from a vehicle, such as a tractor or a trailer of a truck or an automobile, to a remote location, from a portion of a vehicle to other portions of the vehicle, from one vehicle to one or more other vehicles, or from a vehicle to a communications network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Over the years, the vehicle industry and particularly the heavy duty vehicle industry has used tractor and trailer combinations to transport cargo over the roadways to various desired destinations. The tractors and trailer are conventionally mechanically coupled together so that the tractor efficiently and effectively pulls the trailer. Also, this mechanical coupling can often be an integral formed trailer with a tractor or cab region of a vehicle such as a pick-up truck, dump truck or other vehicle. Additionally, one or more other trailers can also be mechanically coupled to another trailer so that only one tractor or cab region pulls a plurality of trailers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various links between the tractor and the trailer provide vehicle subsystems, e.g., hydraulic, pneumatic, or electrical, with power and/or control signals to operate effectively. These subsystem have associated electrical conductors, pneumatic lines, or hydraulic lines extending between the tractor and trailer(s) so that these subsystems can effectively operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Data communications between a tractor and trailer for these subsystems also has been developed. An example of this data communications can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,352 by Jasper titled &ldquo;Communications And Control System For Tractor/Trailer And Associated Method&rdquo; which is assigned to the common assignee of the present application. As described in this patent, the use of the Society of Automotive Engineering (&ldquo;SAE&rdquo;) standard J1708 titled &ldquo;<highlight><italic>Serial Data Communications Between Microcomputer Systems In Heavy Duty Vehicle Applications</italic></highlight>&rdquo; and SAE standard J1939 are also known for data communications in the heavy duty vehicle environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Only recently, however, has the vehicle industries, and particularly the heavy duty vehicle industries, begun to use sophisticated electrical electronic subsystems in and associated with these vehicles to perform varied task that usually involve data manipulation and transmission. Previously, computers, controllers, and computer-type electrical systems were simply not found in these vehicles, such as the tractor and trailer combinations or recreational vehicles, in a significant manner. Much of this previous slow or lack of development and advances could be attributed, for example, to the lack of governmental or other authoritative initiatives which would have otherwise required systems to be installed on these heavy duty vehicles to include sophisticated electronics and data communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although only recently have advances been made with data communications in the vehicle industries, and particularly the heavy duty vehicle industry, many of the advances require extensive retrofitting or extensive additions to the vehicle. Accordingly, many vehicle owners have been hesitant to adopt and purchase sophisticated electronics and data communications because of the expense and uncertainty with the advances in the technology. Yet, having the capability to monitor and communicate with the various electronic subsystems of a vehicle such as a tractor-trailer truck, recreational vehicle, or automobile can be beneficial to the driver, the owner, governmental officials or agencies, and others having an interest in the vehicle industries. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The data communications apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, e.g., preferably provided by twisted pair wiring as understood by those skilled in the art, or other conductor configurations such as single wire, which are preferably connected to the plurality of electronic subsystems <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and associated with the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> preferably provide one or more data communications channels or paths for data communications with the electronic subsystems <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as well as a controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> as described further below herein. For example, data can be directly communicated, e.g., on/off, status, threshold levels, RS-232, or RS-485 protocols, through the conductors or power line carrier (&ldquo;PLC&rdquo;) communication protocols such as Spread Spectrum, e.g., CEBus, X-10, such as offered by Cogency Semiconductor, Inc. of Canada or Intellon Corp. of Ocala, Fla. or other protocols along the conductors as understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As perhaps best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 11</cross-reference>, the data communications apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably also has vehicle data communications protocol converting means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&prime;, e.g., preferably provided by a vehicle data communications protocol converter as illustrated by first and second data communications protocol converters <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>&prime; and a first signal booster <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime;, connected to the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&prime; for converting a first data communications protocol associated with data communications along the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&prime; to a second data communications protocol. As understood by those skilled in the art, the first data communications protocol is preferably according to SAE J1708, but also could be according to SAE J1939, SAE J1587, RS-485, or power line carrier (&ldquo;PLC&rdquo;) protocols as well. In other words, the first data communications protocol is preferably an existing data communications protocol associated with a vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The first data communications protocol converter <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is preferably an RS-485 transceiver, as understood by those skilled in the art, which transmits and receives data communications according to the J1708 or other protocols to the plurality of conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and transmits and receives data communications according to the RS-485 protocol to the second data communications protocol converter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and vice-versa. Other data communication protocols such as global communications network, e.g., Internet, protocol can be used as well according to the present invention. A through-the-air data communications protocol, however, can be particularly advantageous so that a driver or passenger does not have to exit a vehicle, locate a cable, and connect it to a vehicle and yet can accomplish accurate and efficient data communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the vehicle data communications protocol converting means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can convert the first data communications protocol, e.g., SAE J1708, into a third data communications protocol, e.g., RS-485, and then convert the third data communications protocol, e.g., RS-485, into yet the second data communications protocol, e.g., IrDa or other infrared or RF data communications protocol such as Bluetooth, 802.11 Standard, or other RF data communications protocols, or a designated communications network protocol such as the Internet, which is used to transmit data through-the-air to a remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>&prime; (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 11</cross-reference>). The second data communications protocol converter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> preferably is a combination of a microprocessor or other microcontroller connected to the RS-485 transceiver which transmits and receives logic level signals and an infrared IrDA compliant integrated circuit, such as provided by Hewlett Packard or Rohm as understood by those skilled in the art, connected to the microprocessor which transmits and receives the logic level signals, a Bluetooth, 802.11 Standard or other RF data communications protocol compliant integrated circuit, or a designated communication network, such as the Internet, compliant integrated circuit, such as provided by Zilog, e.g., the eZ80 Webserver, as understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When transmitting from the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the IrDA compliant integrated circuit receives logic levels from the microcontroller and converts the logic levels to IrDA data communications protocol based upon timed infrared pulse signals of a predetermined position, pulse widths, and/or duration depending on the desired baud or bit rate of data communications. The IrDA integrated circuit also receives an infrared data communications protocol and transmits logic levels when receiving data communications from a remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The IrDA integrated circuit can include a built-in infrared transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, e.g., an infrared light emitting diode and an infrared photodetector or photodiode. At least the infrared light emitter or light emitting diode, however, is preferably not built into the IrDA integrated circuit because the vehicle data communications protocol converting means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> also preferably includes the first signal booster <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. If infrared is used, for example, an infrared transceiver or emitter/detector pair such as provided by Sharp Corp., namely the Opto-Electronic Devices Division such as Model No. GP2W0004YP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> If infrared is one or more of the first, second, or third data communications protocol as described herein, then preferably one or more coverings to effect shading and/or filtering of a receiver or detector portion of an infrared transceiver is preferably used to reduce any impact or interference from station,room or other lights which may emit infrared or near infrared wavelengths of light and to increase the ease and clarity of recognition of a data communications signal. The covering, for example, can be a hood or cup formed closely adjacent at least a portion of the receiver or detector other than the standard encapsulation of the receiver or detector so that the potential interfering light is shaded out or reduced so that it is not directed toward the receiver as much. In addition to or as an alternative, different filtering techniques can be used as well such as covering the receiver with a lens or other filter which assists in enhancing data communication signal recognition, especially in environments which may otherwise cause signal recognition to be somewhat difficult. For example, an infrared receiver or detector can have a standard encapsulation and then according to the present invention a lens or protective covering can be used to overlie or surround the encapsulated receiver or detector. Then still, a hood, cup, or other protective and shading member can be used to further shade or cover the lens to yet further reduce interference from room, station, or other lights or to enhance signal recognition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The second data communications protocol is preferably one of either an infrared data communications protocol, an RF data communications protocol, or a designated communications network protocol such as the Internet. In other words, the second data communications protocol is preferably a through-the-air type of data communications protocol which does not require equipment to be coupled to the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when obtaining data therefrom or monitoring vehicle operational conditions. If the data communications is according to an RF data communications protocol as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, then the second data communication protocol converter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>&prime; preferably includes an RF data communications integrated circuit or analog circuit as understood by those skilled in the art which receives and transmits logic levels to a microprocessor or microcontroller and transmits and receives RF data communications according to predetermined RF data communications protocol, e.g., a simple modulation scheme or a more complex protocol such as CEBus as understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Additionally, particularly on the transmit portion of the vehicle data communications converting means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the converting means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a signal booster <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, e.g., preferably provided by amplification circuitry and/or power boosting circuitry, which advantageously boosts the transmit signal to thereby increase the successful transmit range of the associated transmit portion of the transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An infrared data communications protocol, such as IrDA as understood by those skilled in the art, can be particularly advantageous in association with vehicles for numerous reasons. For example, dirt, dust, grime, corrosive atmospheres, vibration, rough handling, or other obstacles can often be readily overcome with appropriate design of the driving and receiving electronics. Also, infrared data communications is immune from electro-magnetic interference (&ldquo;EMI&rdquo;) which, as understood by those skilled in the art, can impact other types of data communications media. Further, infrared data communications would not interfere with other type of through-the-air data communications channels such as RF data communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> If an RF data communications protocol is used, as understood by those skilled in the art, then the RF data communications protocol preferably has designated bandwidths or other techniques used to reduce noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably connected to the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can also be connected to one or more of the electronic subsystems <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, e.g., an ABS system, preferably through the electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. For example, the connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be a six-pin Deutch connector or other well known connector associated with trucks or other vehicles (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in a first embodiment, also can be advantageously positioned in the cab <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the tractor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the truck (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). This location, for example, is a secure position for a transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, as described further below herein, because the cab <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be locked and a security alarm system or other security system can be associated with the cab <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the cab <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> provides a convenient position for the driver, government officials, or others involved in the related industry to provide access to operational conditions of the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This further takes advantage of existing positions of vehicle connectors to tap into or access the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which provide data or information to the cab of the tractor without requiring extensive rewiring, retrofitting, or adding expensive equipment to the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As perhaps best illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in a second embodiment of the connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;, for example, the connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; can be positioned more closely in association with one of the electronic subsystems <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such as the ABS system of the trailer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the truck. The second embodiment also illustrates a connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; known to those in the vehicle art, and namely the trucking industry. This connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;, however, is advantageously modified by adding a transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as described further below herein. In each of the first and second embodiments, the connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; preferably includes a plurality of pins <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> having a predetermined pin configuration. The connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; also preferably has one of either a generally cylindrical or a generally rectangular shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; also preferably has first and second mating connector portions <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime; which are joined together by a frictional fit so that the plurality of pins <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are matingly received into a corresponding plurality of contact elements <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. As understood by those skilled in the art, the connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; can also have some type of connector aligning means associated therewith for readily aligning the first and second mating connector portions <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is preferably detachably connected to the connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime;. The transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; also preferably includes a translucent cover member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for transmitting the second data communications protocol therethrough. In a first embodiment of the transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can either include the second mating connector portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> being formed as a portion of or integrally as a single piece therewith, or the second mating connector portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can define the transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in this embodiment likewise preferably has one of either a cylindrical or a rectangular shape. The transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> preferably includes or has integrally formed as one piece therewith an optically translucent cover member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for transmitting and receiving infrared or RF data communications therethrough to the remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, because the transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> forms a portion of or readily attaches to a standard vehicle connector, e.g., the first mating connector portion <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the data communications apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is readily adapted to existing vehicle data communication technology and does not require either extensive retrofitting or extensive and expensive additions to existing vehicle data communication technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As perhaps best illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in a second embodiment of the transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime;, the transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; can advantageously be a vehicle light housing mounted to the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for housing a vehicle light. The vehicle light housing, for example, can advantageously be a side-marker light housing mounted to the trailer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of a truck so that a third party would not readily recognize that the truck is equipped with the data communications apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is preferably positioned within the transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime; and connected to the vehicle data communications protocol converting means <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for transmitting the second data communications protocol from the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and receiving the data communications protocol from a remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. For infrared data communications, for example, the transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) preferably includes a plurality of infrared light emitter or light emitting diodes, a plurality of infrared photodiodes, and associated drive and amplification circuitry as understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As also understood by those skilled in the art, the transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is preferably only a physical layer signal processing transceiver, e.g., infrared or radio frequency, and preferably includes a combination transmitter and receiver which collects data or information from the various subsystems and communicates the data to one or more remote data communications terminals <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the apparatus is not limited to communication by a physical layer signal processing transceiver, but that other communication protocol techniques can be used as well. The transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is preferably a first transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and the one or more remote data communication terminals <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably each include a second transceiver <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>&prime; for transmitting the second data communications protocol to the first transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and receiving the second data communications protocol from the first transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The second transceiver <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>&prime; is preferably similar to the first transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as described herein above and accordingly for brevity will not be repeated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The first and second transceivers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>&prime; also each include a signal processing physical layer. Advantageously, the second data communications protocol only uses the physical layer of the first and second transceivers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> for signal processing and not a data link layer (&ldquo;DLL&rdquo;) as understood by those skilled in the art. By only using the physical layer for signal processing, the data communications and coding or modulation schemes for the communications is greatly simplified and the data conversion from one data communications protocol to another data communications protocol is also simplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is preferably a computer, e.g., provided by a portable laptop or handheld computer, or other portable or substantially stationary remote data collection stations as understood by those skilled in the art. The remote data communications terminal, for example, can be positioned at one or more locations where a vehicle owner, another vehicle, security system, or other data collection point such as an entrance to a shop, station, or fuel island desires to collect data. The second transceiver does not need to be near or adjacent the computer or other terminal itself as long as the second transceiver is positioned to receive the second data communication protocol from the vehicle. The remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also includes remote data communications protocol converting means <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, e.g., preferably provided by a remote data communication protocol converter as illustrated by the third data communications protocol converter <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and the second signal booster <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, for converting the second data communications protocol received by the remote data communications terminal to a third data communications protocol associated with the computer. The third data communications protocol, for example, can be RS-232, RS-422, RS-423 or other data communications protocol, as understood by those skilled in the art. If two conversions occur in the vehicle data converter <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, e.g., RS-485 to RS-232 and RS-232 to IrDA or RF, then the third data communications protocol would actually be yet a fourth data communications protocol as sequentially illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 10</cross-reference>. The remote data communications protocol converting means <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, e.g., a remote data communications protocol converter, also preferably includes data signal boosting means, e.g., a second signal booster <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> similar to the first signal booster <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as described above herein, for boosting the range of the signal between the remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the first transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the data communications apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to thereby increase the effective range of transmission for which the apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is anticipated to be used. The remote data communications terminal also preferably includes a predetermined data communications protocol transceiver <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>&prime;, e.g., preferably provided by an RS-232 transceiver or other type of transceiver as understood by those skilled in the art, as a data communications interface to the personal computer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> or other data terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The data communications apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to the present invention preferably also includes at least one controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> connected to the at least one electronic subsystem <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the plurality of electrical connectors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for controlling data communications along the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, e.g., to and from the electronic subsystem(s) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As understood by those skilled in the art, the controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> preferably includes a microprocessor or microcomputer operating under stored program control to perform various functions related to the monitoring and control of various electronic subsystems on either or both of the tractor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and trailer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or to the remote data communications terminals <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As set forth previously above, each electronic subsystem <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be controlled and/or monitored preferably includes signal generating means, e.g., preferably provided by a signal generator, connected to the controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for generating a signal related to the operation of the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, for example, produces or outputs a number of digital or analog output controls in the form of relay contact closures or other signals to either the subsystems or to the transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, for example, can also be an ABS controller which actuates control valves on the trailer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to control the brake chambers of the brakes associated with the trailer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the apparatus also provides communication between vehicles, from portions of a vehicle, e.g., within nodes, and communication to other communication networks such as in a building or a global communications network. In these embodiments, a vehicle, such as a tractor-trailer combination which is actually two vehicles, e.g., a tractor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and a trailer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, communicates with another vehicle, namely a security vehicle such as a law enforcement or police vehicle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). In these embodiments, for example, a first infrared or RF transceiver preferably is advantageously mounted to a trailer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (or a tractor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>) for communication with the security vehicle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> using wireless data communications. The security vehicle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> then has a second infrared or RF transceiver mounted thereto for wireless data communications between the vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the security vehicle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, for example, can gather information such as vehicle identification data, secure information such as vehicle and/or cargo weight, driver registration information, cargo contents, or operation characteristics of the vehicle without the need to stop the vehicle. This, in turn, provides an added level of security to highway or other roadway travel, especially in the event of a stolen, unauthorized, hijacked, or other potentially dangerous or hazardous situation. In these embodiments, the security vehicle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is preferably equipped with a remote data communications terminal or other data collection, gathering, or transmitting device such as mounted to a side panel of a door, positioned in a dashboard region of the security vehicle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, positioned along one of the windows of the security vehicle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, or positioned in association with the trunk or engine compartments of the security vehicle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The apparatus <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in these embodiments is preferably substantially similar to the one described in the above embodiments and can be positioned in a light marker housing or other housing for communication between vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In addition, such as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the apparatus <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>&prime; also includes communications between a tractor and a trailer as two separate vehicles or as a combination of one vehicle. In these embodiments, a first transceiver preferably is mounted to the rearward portions of the tractor and a second transceiver preferably is mounted to the forward portions of the trailer so that the distance between the transceivers is minimized and be readily ascertainable. In this manner, a driver can monitor the contents of the trailer without having to leave his seat to physically inspect the trailer. The driver can also be made aware of various trailer conditions. In turn, the tractor can have a remote data terminal positioned therein so that the trailer has the first data communications protocol in a network within the trailer, the first data communications protocol is converted to the second data communications protocol for a through the air wireless communication between the trailer and the tractor, the tractor receives the second data communications protocol, and then converts it to a third data communications protocol for a remote terminal such as positioned in the cab of the tractor for displaying, viewing, and interfacing with the driver or passenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Also, for example, a high speed and a low speed data communications protocol such as PLC can coexist on the same power lines. Also, two or more low speed data communications protocols, such as CEBus and PowerBus, can coexist on the same lines if desired as a PLC communications. At low speed, although there may be a certain amount of conflict between the communication protocols, the communication protocols preferably share the available bandwidth where coexistence is desired or occurs. Adding PowerBus nodes to a CEBus network will reduce the throughput of the CEBus network, but should not result in communication failures using either technology. Although lower speeds, e.g., less than 100 kilobits per second (Kbps), may be desired due to lower cost and increased reliability for certain types of communication, but higher speeds, e.g., greater than 100 Kbps can be used as well according to the present invention. Higher speeds, for example, are particular applicable to shared broadband access, low-latency audio and video streaming, and high reliability using high speed PLC integrated circuit or chip sets such as provided by Cogency Semiconductor, Inc. of Canada or Intellon Corp. of Ocala, Fla. More preferably, these higher speeds are even higher than 10 Megabits per second (Mbps). The higher speed PLC, for example, can use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signal processing over power lines as understood by those skilled in the art and can be used as an alternative to lower speed PLC or, more preferably, in conjunction with lower speed PLC. When used in conjunction with the lower speed PLC, the higher speed PLC is preferably positioned in the same controller, but two separate controllers can be used as well as understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the present invention also includes methods of data communications associated with a vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The method preferably includes providing a plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> associated with a vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and converting a first vehicle data communications protocol associated with data communications along the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to a second data communications protocol. The method also includes transmitting the second data communications protocol from the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The first data communications protocol is preferably either SAE J1708 or SAE J1939. The second data communications protocol, on the other hand, is preferably one of either an infrared data communications protocol or an RF data communications protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The method can also include receiving the second data communications protocol from the remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, controlling data communications along the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and generating a signal related to the operation of the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, the remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be a computer, and the method can include remotely converting the second data communications protocol received by the remote data communications terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to a third data communications protocol associated with the computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The method additionally can include positioning a connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so as to be connected in series with the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, positioning a transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in association with the connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, detachably connecting a transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the connector <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and positioning the transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> within the transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The transceiver housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> preferably includes a translucent cover member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for transmitting and receiving the second data communications protocol therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The method can still further include providing at least one electronic subsystem <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> associated with the heavy duty vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and connected to the plurality of electrical conductors <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> related to operation of the vehicle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is preferably a first transceiver, and the remote data communication terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a second transceiver <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The method also includes transmitting the second data communications protocol to the first transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and receiving the second data communications protocol from the first transceiver <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The first and second transceivers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> each preferably include a physical layer, and the method further includes transmitting and receiving the second data communications protocol only using the physical layer of the first and second transceivers <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed a typical preferred embodiment of the invention, and although specific terms are employed, the terms are used in a descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.
