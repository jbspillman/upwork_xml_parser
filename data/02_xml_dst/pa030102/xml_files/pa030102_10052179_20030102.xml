<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of delivering heterologous nucleic acid (e.g., a gene sequence) into a cell comprises attaching a virus containing a heterologous gene sequence to a G protein coupled receptor (i.e., a seven transmembrane receptor such as the P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor). The virus may be attached to the receptor by means of a bridging antibody, or by binding an antibody specific for the receptor with an antibody specific for the virus, wherein the antibody that specifically binds with the receptor and the antibody that specifically binds to the virus are cross-linked. Alternatively, the virus may express a peptide that specifically binds to the receptor. The receptor may be induced to internalize by means of the addition of a ligand known to trigger internalization of the receptor into the cell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to methods and systems useful in the transfer of nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The capacities to introduce a particular foreign or native gene sequence into a mammalian cell and to control the expression of that gene are of substantial value in the fields of medical and biological research. Such capacities provide a means for studying gene regulation, and for designing a therapeutic basis for the treatment of disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The introduction of a particular foreign or native gene into mammalian host cells is facilitated first by introducing a gene sequence into a suitable nucleic acid vector. A variety of methods have been developed which are capable of permitting the introduction of such a recombinant vector into a desired host cell. The use of viral vectors can result in the rapid introduction of the recombinant molecule in a wide variety of host cells. In particular, viral vectors have been employed in order to increase the efficiency of introducing a recombinant nucleic acid vector into host cells. Viruses that have been employed as vectors for the transduction and expression of exogenous genes in mammalian cells include SV40 virus (see, e.g., H. Okayama et al., Molec. Cell. Biol. 5, 1136-1142 (1985)); bovine papilloma virus (see, e.g., D. DiMaio et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 4030-4034 (1982)); adenovirus (see, e.g., J. E. Morin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 4626 (1987)), adeno-associated virus (AAV; see, e.g., N. Muzyczka et al., J. Clin. Invest. 94, 1351 (1994)); herpes simplex virus (see, e.g., A. I. Geller, et al., Science 241, 1667 (1988)), and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Efforts to introduce recombinant molecules into mammalian cells have been hampered by the inability of many cells to be infected by the above-described viral or retroviral vectors. Limitations on retroviral vectors, for example, include a relatively restricted host range, based in part on the level of expression of the membrane protein that serves as the viral receptor. M. P. Kavanaugh et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 91, 7071-7075 (1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need in the art for improved methods of introducing and expressing genes in target cells. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The shortcomings of current methods of receptor-mediated gene transfer are overcome by the methods and complexes of the present invention. In particular, the invention is based upon the unexpected discovery by the present inventors that the rate limiting step of viral vector uptake by cell surface receptors is not, as originally thought, the binding event of the virus to the receptor, but rather the internalization of the receptor itself. Accordingly, this invention relates to new complexes that facilitate the transfer of nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells. This invention allows for targeting transfer vectors to specific cell types, attachment of the vectors to the cells and regulated cellular internalization of the vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention comprises binding a transfer vector to a receptor that is internalized by a cell. The receptor is one that is either internalized by a cell upon the cell&apos;s exposure to a specific ligand, or for which a receptor may be induced to internalize by exposure to such a ligand. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A transfer vector-receptor complex of the present invention comprises a transfer vector bound to a receptor that is capable of being internalized into a cell. The transfer vector may contain an exogenous nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a gene), and may express an exogenous protein or peptide. In particular preferred embodiments, described in more detail hereinbelow, the transfer vector is targeted to a seven transmembrane (7-TM) receptor by means of an antibody specific to the receptor, by means of a peptide expressed by the transfer vector that specifically binds said receptor, or by means of a natural or modified ligand. The transfer vector may be any suitable vector, including a viral vector, a plasmid, an oligonucleotide, or RNA/DNA chimeric molecules, as is described more fully hereinbelow. Interaction between the 7-TM receptor and the targeted complex results in receptor-complex internalization, thereby introducing the heterologous nucleic acid carried by the transfer vector into the cell where it is expressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A. Viral Transfer Vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, a complex (i.e., a conjugate) of the present invention comprises a viral vector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (which is illustrated in the figure as an adenovirus) attached to a 7-TM receptor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which receptor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is present on a cell surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The viral vector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached to the 7-TM receptor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by means of a bifunctional bridging antibody <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The bifunctional bridging antibody <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is composed of one antibody <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which specifically binds the viral vector. The antibody <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is chemically cross-linked to antibody <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which specifically binds the 7-TM receptor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although the viral vector <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated as an adenovirus vector (AdV), it will be understood that the present invention may also be practiced with other viral vectors, including but not limited to human and nonhuman retrovirus (ie., Maloney virus such as Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus and lentiviruses) vectors, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, and herpes virus vectors (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The viral vectors of the present invention may be attenuated viruses or may be rendered non-replicative by any method known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> However, the use of adenoviruses as the vector is currently preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The viral vectors of the present invention will have the capacity to include exogenous nucleic acids. The delivery of the heterologous nucleic acid facilitates the replication of the heterologous nucleic acid within the target cell, and the subsequent production of a heterologous protein therein. A heterologous protein is herein defined as a protein or fragment thereof wherein all or a portion of the protein is not naturally expressed by the target cell. A nucleic acid or gene sequence is said to be heterologous if it is not naturally present in the wild type of the viral vector used to deliver the gene into a cell (e.g., the wild-type adenovirus genome). The term &ldquo;nucleic acid sequence&rdquo; or &ldquo;gene sequence, &rdquo; as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule (preferably DNA). Such gene sequences may be derived from a variety of sources including DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA, RNA or combinations thereof. Such gene sequences may comprise genomic DNA which may or may not include naturally occurring introns. Moreover, such genomic DNA may be obtained in association with promoter sequences or poly-adenylation sequences. The gene sequences of the present invention are preferably cDNA. Genomic or cDNA may be obtained in any number of ways. Genomic DNA can be extracted and purified from suitable cells by means well-known in the art. Alternatively, mRNA can be isolated from a cell and used to prepare cDNA by reverse transcription, or other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Standard techniques for the construction of the vectors of the present invention are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be found in such references as Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>2<highlight><italic>nd Ed. </italic></highlight>(Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). A variety of strategies are available for ligating fragments of DNA, the choice of which depends on the nature of the termini of the DNA fragments and which choices can be readily made by the skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the nucleotide sequence of the inserted heterologous gene sequence or sequences may be of any nucleotide sequence. For example, the inserted heterologous gene sequence may be (or may include) a reporter gene sequence or a selectable marker gene sequence. A reporter gene sequence, as used herein, is any gene sequence which, when expressed, results in the production of a protein whose presence or activity can be monitored. Examples of suitable reporter genes include the gene for galactokinase, beta-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, beta-lactamase, etc. Alternatively, the reporter gene sequence may be any gene sequence whose expression produces a gene product which affects cell physiology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A selectable marker gene sequence is any gene sequence capable of expressing a protein whose presence permits one to selectively propagate a cell which contains it. Examples of selectable marker genes include gene sequences capable of conferring host resistance to antibiotics (e.g., puromycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, and the like), or of conferring host resistance to amino acid analogues, or of permitting the growth of bacteria on additional carbon sources or under otherwise impermissible culture conditions. A gene sequence may be both a reporter gene and a selectable marker gene sequence. The most preferred reporter genes of the present invention are the lacZ gene which encodes the beta-galactosidase activity of <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>; and the gene encoding puromycin resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Preferred reporter or selectable marker gene sequences are sufficient to permit the recognition or selection of the vector in normal cells. In one embodiment of the invention, the reporter gene sequence will encode an enzyme or other protein which is normally absent from mammalian cells, and whose presence can, therefore, definitively establish the presence of the vector in such a cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The heterologous gene sequence may also comprise the coding sequence of a desired product such as a suitable biologically active protein or polypeptide, immunogenic or antigenic protein or polypeptide, or a therapeutically active protein or polypeptide. Preferably, the heterologous gene sequence encodes a therapeutically active protein or polypeptide. In one particular preferred embodiment, the heterologous gene sequence encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein or biologically active analogs, fragments, or derivatives thereof. Alternatively, the heterologous gene sequence may comprise a sequence complementary to an RNA sequence, such as an antisense RNA sequence, which antisense sequence can be administered to an individual to inhibit expression of a complementary polynucleotide in the cells of the individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Expression of the heterologous gene may provide immunogenic or antigenic protein or polypeptide to achieve an antibody response, which antibodies can be collected from an animal in a body fluid such as blood, serum or ascites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to employ as the inserted heterologous gene sequence a gene sequence which already possesses a promoter, initiation sequence, or processing sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> B. Non-Viral Vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In other preferred embodiments, the transfer vector is non-viral. Other suitable vectors include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotides (including RNA, DNA, synthetic and modified nucleic acids), plasmids, and RNA/DNA chimeric molecules as described by E. Kometz. Oligonucleotide vectors include antisense oligonucleotides and oligonucleotides that function as ribozymes. The non-viral transfer vectors of the present invention are able to include exogenous nucleic acids as described hereinabove with respect to viral vectors. Oligonucleotides, plasmids, and RNA/DNA chimeric molecules can be synthesized or produced by any suitable method known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> C. Seven Transmembrane Receptors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Receptors that may be used to carry out the present invention belong to the family of 7-TM receptors. See generally, S. Watson et al., <highlight><italic>The G-Protein Linked Receptor FactsBook</italic></highlight>, Academic Press, New York (1994); U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,835 to King et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that 7-TM receptors are G protein coupled receptors. Any mammalian G protein coupled receptor, and the nucleic acid sequences encoding these receptors, may be employed in practicing the present invention. Examples of such receptors include, but are not limited to, dopaaminereceptors, muscarinic cholinergic receptors, cc-adrenergic receptors, opiate receptors, cannabinoid receptors, serotonin receptors, &bgr;-adrenergic receptors, and purinoceptors. The term &ldquo;receptor&rdquo; as used herein is intended to encompass subtypes of the named receptors, and mutants and homologs thereof, along with the nucleic acid sequences encoding the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the 7-TM receptor for use according to the present invention is a purinoceptor as discussed in greater detail below (e.g., P2Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, P2Y<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, P2Y<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and P2Y<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>), an adenosine receptor (i.e., A1, A2, and A3, and sub-types thereof), a bradykinin receptor (e.g., BK<highlight><subscript>I </subscript></highlight>and BK<highlight><subscript>II</subscript></highlight>), or a &bgr;-adrenergic receptor (e.g., &bgr;<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, &bgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and &bgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). Also preferred is the C<highlight><subscript>5A </subscript></highlight>complement receptor. More preferred are the P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, BK<highlight><subscript>II</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2B</subscript></highlight>, &bgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and C<highlight><subscript>5A </subscript></highlight>receptors, with the P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor being most preferred. Thus, ligands that may be used to carry out the present invention include nucleotides, nucleosides, catecholamines (e.g., dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan), C5A, and bradykinin(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(also known as the P<highlight><subscript>2U</subscript></highlight>)-purinoceptor undergoes internalization upon activation with ATP, UTP and analogs thereof. These receptor types are abundant in number on the lumenal surface of the human respiratory epithelium. Mason, S. J., et al. 1991<highlight><italic>. Br. J Phannacol. </italic></highlight>103, 1649-1656. Molecular conjugation of AdV to P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-receptors, followed by activation of these receptors by ATP/UTP, leads to internalization of the vector-ligand-receptor complex into endosomes and thus provide an alternative entry pathway for AdV into the well differentiated (WD) epithelium, and thereafter to gene expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> D. Antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one strategy for targeting transfer vectors carrying heterologous nucleic acids to 7-TM receptors for internalization into the cell is with a bispecific bridging antibody. In general, the bispecific antibody is directed against epitopes on both the transfer vector and the 7-TM receptor of interest (i.e., has a combining region that specifically recognizes the transfer vector and a combining region that specifically recognizes the 7-TM receptor), thereby forming a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; between the transfer vector and the receptor. Binding of the bispecific bridging antibody to the 7-TM receptor induces internalization of the receptor. The bound antibody-transfer vector complex is internalized along with the 7-TM receptor, thereby introducing the transfer vector carrying the heterologous nucleic acid into the cell. According to this embodiment of the invention, the transfer vector is preferably a viral vector, more preferably, AdV, and the bispecific antibody comprises a monoclonal antibody directed against the fiber (knob) protein of the adenovirus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antibodies&rdquo; as used herein refers to all types of immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. Of these, IgM and IgG are particularly preferred. The antibodies may be monoclonal or polyclonal and may be of any species of origin, including (for example) mouse, rat, rabbit, horse, or human, or may be chimeric antibodies. See, e.g., M. Walker et al., Molec. Immunol. 26, 403-11(1989). The antibodies may be recombinant monoclonal antibodies produced according to the methods disclosed in Reading U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,893, or Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. The antibodies may also be chemically constructed by specific antibodies made according to the method disclosed in SegAl et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Antibodies may be polyclonal or monoclonal, with monoclonal being preferred. In particular embodiments, the antibodies are bridging antibodies that are specific to both the target receptor and the transfer vector. According to this embodiment, the bridging antibody is preferably a monoclonal antibody directed to the adenovirus fiber (knob) protein. Also preferred are monoclonal antibodies and bridging antibodies comprising monoclonal antibodies that are directed to specific epitopes of the 7-TM receptor of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Antibodies that bind to the same epitope (i.e., the specific binding site) that is bound by an antibody to the 7-TM receptor can be identified in accordance with known techniques, such as their ability to compete with labeled antibody to the 7-TM receptor in a competitive binding assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Antibody fragments included within the scope of the present invention include, for example, Fab, F(ab&prime;)2, and Fc fragments, and the corresponding fragments obtained from antibodies other than IgG. Such fragments can be produced by known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Polyclonal antibodies used to carry out the present invention may be produced by immunizing a suitable animal (e.g., rabbit, goat, etc.) with an antigen to which a monoclonal antibody to the 7-TM receptor binds, collecting immune serum from the animal, and separating the polyclonal antibodies from the immune serum, in accordance with known procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Monoclonal antibodies used to carry out the present invention may be produced in a hybridoma cell line according to the technique of Kohler and Milstein, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>265, 495-97 (1975). For example, a solution containing the appropriate antigen may be injected into a mouse and, after a sufficient time, the mouse sacrificed and spleen cells obtained. The spleen cells are then immortalized by fusing them with myeloma cells or with lymphoma cells, typically in the presence of polyethylene glycol, to produce hybridoma cells. The hybridoma cells are then grown in a suitable media and the supernatant screened for monoclonal antibodies having the desired specificity. Monoclonal Fab fragments may be produced in <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>by recombinant techniques known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., W. Huse, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>246, 1275-81 (1989). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> E. Non-Antibody Based Targeting Strategies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described above with respect to bispecific bridging antibodies as means of targeting the transfer vector to the 7-TM receptor for internalization. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, alternative targeting strategies include those utilizing peptides and 7-TM receptor agonist/antagonists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> With respect to peptides, the peptide can be a natural ligand that binds to the 7-TM receptor. Peptide agonists and antagonists of 7-TM receptors are known in the art. Additionally, novel 7-TM receptor agonists/antagonists can be identified as described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,835 to King et al. Alternatively, the peptide can be identified by phage display techniques, or any other method in the art, as binding to the 7-TM receptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Methods of synthesizing or producing peptides are well-known in the art. In one particular embodiment, nucleic acids encoding the peptide are fused to or inserted into the gene encoding the AdV knob protein, such that a knob-peptide chimeric protein is expressed. It is known, for example, that exogenous nucleic acid can be expressed in the C-terminus or the HI loop region of the knob protein. In alternate embodiments, concatamers of the peptide are expressed in the knob protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As a further alternative, targeting can be achieved with peptides incorporated into &ldquo;receptorbodies&rdquo;. In general, a receptorbody is a truncated receptor in which a peptide that binds to a 7-TM receptor is substituted for the intramembrane and intracellular region of the adenoviral receptor. This means that the external portion of the viral receptors acts as an &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; to the binding region of the virus (it replaces the need for an antibody to AdV). For example, the external domain of the AdV receptor can be fused to a peptide ligand for a 7-TM receptor. This complex will bind to a recombinant AdV so displaying bradykinin peptide on the surface of the virus. The peptide ligand fused to the truncated AdV receptor will then target this complex to the peptide ligand&apos;s cognate receptor on the cell surface. As yet a further alternative, the transfer vector can be targeted to the 7-TM receptor by a chemically-linked high affinity agonist/antagonist of the 7-TM receptor. High-affinity agonists/antagonists may be peptide ligands, as described above or are other molecules such as nucleotides (e.g., ATP, UTP), dinucleotides (described in more detail hereinbelow), and derivatives thereof. In addition, P2Y receptor ligands, particularly P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor ligands, that can be used to carry out the present invention include all of the compounds, particularly the nucleotides and dinucleotides that are P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ligands and are disclosed in W. Pendergast et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,861 (Nov. 17, 1998), along with all the compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,763,447 to Jacobus and Leighton, 5,789,391 to Jacobus et al., 5,635,160 to Stutts et al., and 5,292,498 to Boucher, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Hematopoietic stem cells, lymphocytes, vascular endothelial cells, respiratory epithelial cells, keratinocytes, skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, neurons and cancer cells are among proposed targets for therapeutic gene transfer, either ex vivo or in vivo. See, e.g., A. D. Miller, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>357, 455-460 (1992); R. C. Mulligan, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>260, 926-932 (1993). These cells and other eukaryotic cells are suitable target cells for the vectors and methods of the present invention. One advantage of the present invention is that it can be used to target heterologous nucleic acids to cells that do not usually bind the transfer vector, i.e, a virus vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> In particular, any cell that expresses a receptor from the 7-TM receptor family is a suitable target for use according to the present invention. Preferred are cells that express purinoceptors (e.g., P2Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, P2Y<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, P2Y<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, P2Y<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>), adenosine receptors (i.e., A1, A2, A3), bradykinin receptors (e.g., BK<highlight><subscript>I</subscript></highlight>, BK<highlight><subscript>II</subscript></highlight>), P&bgr;-adrenergic receptors (e.g., &bgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &bgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &bgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)or the C<highlight><subscript>SA </subscript></highlight>complement receptor. More preferred are cells that express P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, BK<highlight><subscript>II</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2B</subscript></highlight>, &bgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>5A </subscript></highlight>receptors, with cells that express the P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor being most preferred. Also preferred as targets are respiratory epithelial cells, particularly differentiated columnar airway epithelial cells. The cells may be administered the conjugate in vitro or in vivo, such as by administration of an aerosol containing the conjugate to the luminal surface of airway epithelial cells. Thus purinoceptors that may be used in accordance with the present invention include P2 purinoceptors. Numerous P2 purinoceptors are known. See, e.g., P2 Purinoceptors: Localization, Function and Transduction Mechanisms D. Chadwick and J. Goode Eds 1996. P2 purinoceptors include P2X, P2Y, P2T, P2U (now designated P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and P2Z purinoceptors (including subclasses thereof). More recently, the purinoceptors have been classified as a P2Y family, consisting of G protein-mediated receptors, and a P2X family, consisting of ligand-gated cation channels. The P2Z purinoceptors, which open non-selective pores, may be considered a third family. Id. at 6-7. Since different purinoceptors are found on different tissues, the tissue or tissues to be transformed may be determined in part by selection of the purinoceptor to be targeted, and a corresponding ligand selected for the purinoceptor to be targeted, as discussed in greater detail below. Of course, it will be appreciated that many ligands bind to multiple receptor subtypes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> H. Gene Transfer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention provide a means for delivering heterologous nucleic acid independent of the target cell nucleus into a broad phylogenetic range of host cells. The vectors, methods and pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention are additionally useful in a method of administering a protein or peptide to a subject in need of the desired protein or peptide, as a method of treatment or otherwise. In this manner, the protein or peptide may thus be produced in vivo in the subject. The subject may be in need of the protein or peptide because the subject has a deficiency of the protein or peptide, or because the production of the protein or peptide in the subject may impart some therapeutic effect, as a method of treatment or otherwise, and as explained further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> The gene transfer technology of the present invention has several applications. The most immediate applications are perhaps in elucidating the processing of peptides and functional domains of proteins. Cloned cDNA or genomic sequences for proteins can be introduced into different cell types in culture, or in vivo, in order to study cell-specific differences in processing and cellular fate. By placing the coding sequences under the control of a strong promoter, a substantial amount of the desired protein can be made. Furthermore, the specific residues involved in protein processing, intracellular sorting, or biological activity can be determined by mutational change in discrete residues of the coding sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Gene transfer technology of the present invention can also be applied to provide a means to control expression of a protein and to assess its capacity to modulate cellular events. Some functions of proteins, such as their role in differentiation, may be studied in tissue culture, whereas others will require reintroduction into in vivo systems at different times in development in order to monitor changes in relevant properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Gene transfer provides a means to study the nucleic acid sequences and cellular factors which regulate expression of specific genes. One approach to such a study would be to fuse the regulatory elements to be studied to reported genes and subsequently assaying the expression of the reporter gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> Gene transfer also possesses substantial potential use in understanding and providing therapy for disease states. There are a number of inherited diseases in which defective genes are known and have been cloned. In some cases, the function of these cloned genes is known. In general, the above disease states fall into two classes: deficiency states, usually of enzymes, which are generally inherited in a recessive manner, and unbalanced states, at least sometimes involving regulatory or structural proteins, which are inherited in a dominant manner. For deficiency state diseases, gene transfer could be used to bring a normal gene into affected tissues for replacement therapy, as well as to create animal models for the disease using antisense mutations. For unbalanced disease states, gene transfer could be used to create a disease state in a model system, which could then be used in efforts to counteract the disease state. Thus the methods of the present invention permit the treatment of genetic diseases, e.g., to screen compounds for activity useful in combatting the disease state. As used herein, a disease state is treated by partially or wholly remedying the deficiency or imbalance which causes the disease or makes it more severe. The use of site-specific integration of nucleic sequences to cause mutations or to correct defects is also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> In one particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention is employed to express an exogenous CFTR protein in respiratory epithelium. According to this embodiment, it is preferred to use an AdV transfer vector carrying the CFTR gene. The AdV-CFTR is directly linked to the 4-amino substituent of the dinucleotide UP<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>C with a sulfo-NHS activated agent, as described above. Binding of UP<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>C to the P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor on the apical surface of the respiratory epithelium will induce internalization of the entire UP<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>C-AdV-CFTR complex into epithelial cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> I. Pharmaceutical Formulations, Subjects, and Methods of Administration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Suitable subjects to treated according to the present invention include both avian and mammalian subjects, preferably mammalian. Any mammalian subject in need of being treated according to the present invention is suitable. Human subjects are preferred. Human subjects of both genders and at any stage of development (i.e., neonate, infant, juvenile, adolescent, adult) can be treated according to the present invention. Human subjects afflicted with cystic fibrosis are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The compounds of the invention may be present in the form of theirs pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as, but not limited to, an alkali metal salt such as sodium or potassium; an alkaline earth metal salt such as manganese, magnesium, or calcium; or an ammonium or tetraalkyl ammonium salt, i.e., NX4<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>(wherein X is C<highlight><subscript>1-4</subscript></highlight>). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Active compounds of the present invention can be administered to a subject in need thereof by any suitable means including oral, rectal, transmucosal, topical or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. Alternately, one may administer the compound in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, in a depot or sustained release formulation. Administration to the lungs is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Active compounds disclosed herein may be administered to the lungs of a subject by any suitable means, but are preferably administered by administering an aerosol suspension of respirable particles comprised of the active compound, which the subject inhales. The respirable particles may be liquid or solid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Aerosols of liquid particles comprising the active compound may be produced by any suitable means, such as with a pressure-driven aerosol nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,729. Nebulizers are commercially available devices which transform solutions or suspensions of the active ingredient into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means of acceleration of compressed gas, typically air or oxygen, through a narrow venturi orifice or by means of ultrasonic agitation. Suitable formulations for use in nebulizers consist of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier, the active ingredient comprising up to 40% w/w of the formulation, but preferably less than 20% w/w. The carrier is typically water (and most preferably sterile, pyrogen-free water) or a dilute aqueous alcoholic solution, preferably made isotonic with body fluids by the addition of, for example, sodium chloride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Optional additives include preservatives if the formulation is not made sterile, for example, methyl hydroxybenzoate, antioxidants, flavoring agents, volatile oils, buffering agents and surfactants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Aerosols of solid particles comprising the active compound may likewise be produced with any solid particulate medicament aerosol generator. Aerosol generators for administering solid particulate medicaments to a subject produce particles which are respirable, as explained above, and generate a volume of aerosol containing a predetermined metered dose of a medicament at a rate suitable for human administration. One illustrative type of solid particulate aerosol generator is an insufflator. Suitable formulations for administration by insufflation include finely comminuted powders which may be delivered by means of an insufflator or taken into the nasal cavity in the manner of a snuff. In the insufflator, the powder (e.g., a metered dose thereof effective to carry out the treatments described herein) is contained in capsules or cartridges, typically made of gelatin or plastic, which are either pierced or opened in situ and the powder delivered by air drawn through the device upon inhalation or by means of a manually-operated pump. The powder employed in the insufflator consists either solely of the active ingredient or of a powder blend comprising the active ingredient, a suitable powder diluent, such as lactose, and an optional surfactant. The active ingredient typically comprises from 0.1 to 100% w/w of the formulation. A second type of illustrative aerosol generator comprises a metered dose inhaler. Metered dose inhalers are pressurized aerosol dispensers, typically containing a suspension or solution formulation of the active ingredient in a liquified propellant. During use these devices discharge the formulation through a valve adapted to deliver a metered volume, typically from 10 to 150 &mgr;l, to produce a fine particle spray containing the active ingredient. Suitable propellants include certain chlorofluorocarbon compounds, for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane and mixtures thereof. The formulation may additionally contain one or more co-solvents, for example, ethanol, surfactants, such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, antioxidants and suitable flavoring agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> The aerosol, whether formed from solid or liquid particles, may be produced by the aerosol generator at a rate of from about 10 to 150 liters per minute, more preferably from about 30 to 150 liters per minute, and most preferably about 60 liters per minute. Aerosols containing greater amounts of medicament may be administered more rapidly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> The dosage of the active compounds disclosed herein or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, will vary depending on the condition being treated and the state of the subject, but generally may be an amount-sufficient to achieve dissolved concentrations of active compound on the airway surfaces of the subject of from about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>or 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7 </superscript></highlight>to about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>Moles/liter, and more preferably from about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>to about 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>Moles/liter. Depending upon the solubility of the particular formulation of active compound administered, the daily dose may be divided among one or several unit dose administrations. Other compounds may be administered concurrently with the active compounds, or salts thereof, of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Solid or liquid particulate pharmaceutical formulations containing active agents of the present invention should include particles of respirable size: that is, particles of a size sufficiently small to pass through the mouth and larynx upon inhalation and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs. In general, particles ranging from about 1 to 5 microns in size (more particularly, less than about 4.7 microns in size) are respirable. Particles of non-respirable size which are included in the aerosol tend to be deposited in the throat and swallowed, and the quantity of non-respirable particles in the aerosol is preferably minimized. For nasal administration, a particle size in the range of 10-500 &mgr;m is preferred to ensure retention in the nasal cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> In administering the active compounds of the present invention, they may be administered separately (either concurrently or sequentially) or, alternatively and preferably, they may be pre-mixed and administered as preformed conjugates. As an illustrative example, as suitable dose of a transfer vector carrying a heterologous nucleic acid of interest, can be pre-mixed with a targeting molecule (i.e., a bispecific bridging antibody, a peptide, biotin-UTP, etc.) and the complex administered to the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> In the manufacture of a formulation according to the invention, active agents or the physiologically acceptable salts or free bases thereof are typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a capsule, which may contain from 0.5% to 99% by weight of the active compound. One or more active compounds may be incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which formulations may be prepared by any of the well-known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Compositions containing respirable dry particles of active compound may be prepared by grinding the active compound with a mortar and pestle, and then passing the micronized composition through a 400 mesh screen to break up or separate out large agglomerates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> The pharmaceutical composition may optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formation of an aerosol. A suitable dispersant is lactose, which may be blended with the active agents in any suitable ratio (e.g., a 1 to 1 ratio by weight). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In summary, the transfer vectors of the present invention can be used to stably transfect either dividing or non-dividing cells, and stably express a heterologous gene. Using this vector system, it is now possible to introduce into dividing or non-dividing cells, genes which encode proteins that can affect the physiology of the cells. The vectors of the present invention can thus be useful in gene therapy for disease states, or for experimental modification of cell physiology, such as to produce models useful in screening compounds for particular physiologic activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Having now described the invention, the same will be illustrated with reference to certain examples which are included herein for illustration purposes only, and which are not intended to be limiting of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Epithelial cells are derived from CF and non-CF nasal and bronchial airway epithelia using procedures similar to those described by Gray et al. 1996<highlight><italic>. Am. J Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>14, 104-112. Resected nasal turbinates or portions of mainstem/lobar bronchi representing excess donor tissue are obtained at the time of lung transplantation under the auspices of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects. Epithelial cells are removed from the specimens by protease XIV digestion as described (Wu, R., et al., 1985<highlight><italic>. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. </italic></highlight>132, 311-320), but omitting the filtration step. 1-2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells are plated per 100 mm tissue culture dish in modified LHC9 medium. Lechner, J. F. and Laveck, M. A. 1985. <highlight><italic>J. Tiss. Cult. Meth. </italic></highlight>9, 43-48. The modifications include increasing the EGF concentration to 25 ng/ml, adjusting the retinoic acid concentration to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>M, and supplementation with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.8% bovine pituitary extract. At approximately 75% confluence, the cells are harvested by trypsinization and passage 1 cells are plated at a density of 2.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cells on Transwell-Col inserts (Coming-Costar, 24 mm diameter, 0.4 &mgr;m pore size), in modified medium. The medium is similar to the supplemented LHC9 except that a 50:50 mixture of LHC Basal (Biofluids) and DMEM-H is used as the base, amphotericin and gentamycin are omitted and the EGF concentration is reduced to 0.5 ng/ml. After the cells grow to confluence (4-6 days) the apical surface of the cultures are given an air-liquid interface for another 25-30 days until use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Initial histological analyses of human well differentiated (WD) cultures derived from non-CF nasal airways after 34 days of culture indicate that the epithelium is pseudostratified mucociliary, with abundant cilia and cell-types representative of those present in human nasal airways in vivo. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Binding and Internalization of AdV in Human PD and WD Airway Epithelial Cells </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Experiments showing that adenovirus vector (AdV)-internalization, not AdV-binding, is the rate-limiting step resulting in low efficiency gene transfer to RTE WD cultures are repeated with human cultures to determine if the same rate-limiting step is present. If this is indeed the case, then although the cells have a reduced rate of internalization, it may be possible to increase gene transfer efficiency to WD cultures by enhancing the amount of AdV that binds to these culture-types. For a given concentration of AdV, exposed to either poorly differentiated (PD) or well differentiated (WD) cultures, only approximately 0.1-1% of the total AdV exposed to cells remains attached after washing. Enhancement of AdV-binding above that achieved with a single exposure leads to an increase in gene transfer, since increasing the binding of AdV to cells will increase the probability that an internalization event leads to AdV entry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> To determine the rate-limiting step for inefficient gene transfer in human cultures, PD and WD cultures are exposed to <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-AdSVLacZ (1.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>p) for analyses of AdV-binding, internalization and transgene expression in the human cultures. To investigate the effect of increasing the concentration of AdV and/or the duration of exposure to AdV, PD and WD cultures are exposed to <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-Ad5VLacZ (Pickles, R. J., et al., 1996<highlight><italic>. Human Gene Therapy </italic></highlight>7, 921-931) at a range of concentrations (10<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>-10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>p/ml) for a number of time points (1-24 hrs) at 4&deg; C., after which cultures are washed in medium and then divided into three groups for analyses. Binding is measured as cell-associated radioactivity. Internalization of bound AdV is measured by transferring the cultures to 37&deg; C. for 6 hrs followed by measurement of cell-associated radioactivity after removal of non-internalized radioactivity. Expression is measured by transferring the cultures to 37&deg; C. for 48 hrs before measuring &bgr;-gal activity. Radioactive counts per minute (CPM) and &bgr;-gal activity are standardized with respect to the nominal surface area of the culture surface because the apical surface area of cells exposed to vector is the most appropriate denominator, as it allows direct comparison to the epithelium in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> It is likely that with PD cells, for a specific incubation time, a 10-fold increase in concentration will result in a 10-fold increase in AdV attachment, internalization and gene expression as long as saturation of receptor uptake and expression systems does not occur. With WD cultures, although a 10-fold increase in AdV attachment is expected, the corresponding 10-fold increases in internalization and expression are not. These data indicate that increased binding alone does not overcome the rate-limiting step (internalization) into WD cultures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Targeting of AdV Vectors to the P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>Receptor </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> To test the concept that the P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor is a candidate receptor for targeting based on the ability to bind and internalize an exogenous ligand, we have obtained CHO and A9 cells (both of which are not transducible by AdV) that express the HA-tagged human P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor (HA tag on the extracellular N-terminus) by retroviral gene transfer. HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor expressing A9 cells, but not control cells, stain with fluorescently labeled anti-HA Abs under resting conditions. With agonist &lsqb;ATP&ggr;S (10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>M)&rsqb; exposure, approximately 80% of the receptors are internalized within 45 minutes. The internalization of P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor is mediated via coated pits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Next, a bi-specific antibody (bs-Ab) approach was used to test whether P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor could mediate gene transfer. Antibody HA.11 (BabCO) against influenza hemagglutin (anti-HA) is directed against the HA-epitope inserted into an extracellular domain of the human P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-receptor which is expressed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells. The bridging antibody is produced by reacting an anti-fiber (knob) antibody with m-Maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Sulfo-MBS, Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) or N-(&ggr;-maleimidobutyryloxy) sulfosuccinimide ester (Sulfo-GMBS, Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) at neutral pH. After reduction of anti-HA by mercaptoethylamine, and desalting, the two antibodies are mixed, enabling disulfide cross-link formation. Bi-functional antibody is purified by sequential chromatography over fiber protein and HA columns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Using this bs-Abs against the Ad fiber (knob) and the HA epitope tag (&agr;fiber&times;&agr;HA), binding of bs-Ab and AdV to HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor, but not to null expressing A9 cells has been demonstrated. AdV bound to A9-HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>cells in the presence, but not the absence, of bs-Ab. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> More importantly, P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor specific gene transfer in A9 and CHO cells has been achieved using the bs-Ab approach. In one protocol employing: (1) sequential exposure at 4&deg; C. of HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor expressing A9 versus null vector-expressing A9 cells to varying concentrations of bs-Abs (anti-HA/anti-fiber knob; produced by Dr. R. Pickles in the laboratory of Dr. D. Segal at the NIH) followed by AdV-IacZ (particles per cell&equals;10<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>) (Pickles, R. J., et al., 1996<highlight><italic>. Human Gene Therapy </italic></highlight>7, 921-931); (2) incubation for 1 hour at 37&deg; C. with agonist (ATP&ggr;S, 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>M), followed by incubation for 24 hour in medium; and (3) quantitation of gene transfer efficiency by counting and calculating the percent lacZ positive cells, it was observed that HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor expressing A9 cells are transduced by Ad-lacZ as a function of the concentration of bs-Ab, whereas null A9 cells are not (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). Indeed, it appears that nearly 100% gene transfer efficiency is approached with 30 &mgr;g/ml of bs-Abs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> In a second protocol using preformed conjugates, augmentation of gene transfer that peaked at &tilde;10 &mgr;g/ml bs-Ab was observed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). The fall in transduction efficiency at higher bs-Ab concentrations may reflect competition by unbound bs-Ab for the target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The specificity of the gene transfer observed with bs-Ab in A9-HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-R cells was evaluated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-A9 cells exposed to Ad-LacZ and ATP&ggr;S showed almost 100% expression of LacZ. In contrast, almost no LacZ expression was observed with an irrelevant bs-Ab (anti-Ha/anti-AD P1 epitope), nor in the presence of a 40&times; excess of free anti-HA antibody, nor in cells that had been pre-exposed for 24 hour to a high concentration of agonist (thereby inducing cell-surface receptor down-regulation). These data establish that the HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor mediates gene transfer via specific interactions with anti-HA bs-Abs. Finally, Similar increases in gene transfer to HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-R A9 cells with bs-Abs against HA and biotin (&agr;HA/&agr;biotin) and biotinylated adenoviral vectors have been demonstrated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> The effectiveness of gene transfer by targeting AdV to receptors that undergo internalization is dependent on the internalization efficiency of the receptor. To test the internalization efficiency of P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-receptors, a human P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-receptor (with an influenza hemagluttin (HA) epitope-tag inserted into the extracellular domain) has been overexpressed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells. (S. Sromek and T. K. Harden, Molecular Pharmacology 54, in press (1988)). P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-HA expressing cells were incubated at 37&deg; C. with anon-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATP&ggr;S. At specific time points, after agonist addition, the cells were fixed without permeabilization in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody was incubated with the cells followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Labs). The availability of P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-HA receptors to the anti-HA was visualized with a fluorescent microscope. The astrocytoma cells were fixed and immunostained for the presence of P2Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-HA-receptor in the absence of ATP&ggr;S and after 30 min ATP&ggr;S exposure. In the continued presence of agonist there is a clear loss of immunoreactivity from the plasma membrane and the punctate fluorescent signals, indicating sequestration into endosomes. With ELISA assays internalization was quantitated to occur with an efficiency of 80% (loss of receptor sites with ATP&ggr;S exposures of 1 hr, Dr. Ken Harden, personal communication). This indicates that in the astrocytoma cell-line, internalization of activated receptors occurs efficiently. </paragraph>

In MDCK cells expressing the HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor, the receptors were localized on the apical surfaces. Cells were exposed to anti-HA and anti-mouse IgG FITC at 4&deg; C., and receptor localization determined by confocal microscopy. It was observed that HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptors in the apical membrane of polarized MDCK cells desensitizes, in part, by internalization of receptors. Bs-Abs directed to HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptors sequentially administered with AdV-GFP (green fluorescent protein) and ATP&ggr;S transduce HA-P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptor, as compared with Neo-expressing MDCK cells.

A prototype agonist-linker is biotin (B)-UTP, which contains a 16 atom linker connecting the 5 position of the pyrimidine base to biotin. B-UTP is an agonist of P2Y<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>receptors (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>).

The localization of the membrane-bound (&agr;<highlight><subscript>V</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>3/5 </subscript></highlight>integrins to the apical and/or basolateral membranes of WD cultures is crucial in understanding the roles of these molecules in AdV-mediated gene transfer. The availability of a number of different antibodies to these integrins allows their location in polarized epithelia to be determined. These integrins are also receptors for peptides containing RGD amnino acid sequences. A number of studies have shown that RGD-peptides inhibit AdV-mediated gene transfer to epithelial cells by interaction with the &agr;<highlight><subscript>V</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>3/5 </subscript></highlight>integrins. This Example illustrates the effects of RGD peptides on AdV-binding, internalization and transgene expression in PD and WD cultures. </paragraph>

Briefly, either the apical or basolateral domains of WD cultures were exposed to Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) at 4&deg; C. to biotinylate only external membrane proteins. After solubilization of the cells in a non-denaturing lysis buffer (in the presence of protease inhibitors), proteins were immunoprecipitated and separated by Western analysis on a 4-12% acrylamide gel (Novex) under non-reducing conditions. The biotinylated proteins were probed with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase secondary antibody and detected by ECL analysis (Supersignal CL-HRP, Pierce). The biotinylated proteins identified by R838 are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (bands at 125 kD correspond to the &agr;<highlight><subscript>V </subscript></highlight>and 97 kD are &bgr;<highlight><subscript>3/5 </subscript></highlight>subunits) and appear to be present in the basolateral membranes of RTE cells and in HeLa cells but absent from the apical membrane of the WD cultures, suggesting that rat vitronectin receptors may not be located apically in these culture-types. The absence of these integrins in the apical membrane could account for the low rate of AdV-internalization into these cultures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Investigation of the Cellular Uptake Processes for AdV-Entry </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> Initial attachment of AdV to epithelial cells occurs via the fiber (knob) protein. It is unclear whether fiber protein alone is sufficient to trigger internalization and endosome formation or whether the role of fiber is to aid the virus to locate and exploit an inherent endocytotic event. Internalization of AdV into the cytoplasm however, is mediated, in part, by &agr;<highlight><subscript>V</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>3/5 </subscript></highlight>integrins. T. J. Wickham et al., Cell 73, 309-319 (1993). It has been speculated that &agr;<highlight><subscript>V</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>3/5 </subscript></highlight>integrins are absent or low in number in the apical membranes of both WD cultures and cartilaginous airway epithelium (M. J. Goldman et al, J. Virol. 69, 5951-5958 (1995)), possibly resulting in both the low rate of internalization and gene transfer efficiency in these cell-types. Therefore, the potential cellular uptake processes that may be responsible for entry of AdV into cells are investigated. First, to understand the functional role of the fiber (knob) protein-cell interaction, knob protein is conjugated to fluorescent microspheres of the same diameter as Ad and the initial interactions of the knob-spheres on PD and WD cells are assessed by confocal microscopy. Increased specific or non-specific binding may increase internalization and possibly expression. Second, human &agr;<highlight><subscript>V</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>integrin is overexpressed in WD cultures to direct this protein to the apical membrane. This is used to test the hypothesis that &agr;<highlight><subscript>V</subscript></highlight>&bgr;<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>expression on the apical membrane is the rate-limiting step for internalization and hence gene expression. Third, in order to understand the cell-entry pathways utilized by Ad, cell-lines that are either deficient or competent at coated pit receptor-mediated endocytosis are tested. The hypothesis that high concentrations of AdV may use non-specific entry pathways to gain access into cells is tested. Finally, a strategy is tested to increase the internalization efficiency of AdV into WD cells by exploitation of other cellular uptake mechanisms, i.e., targeting AdV to specific receptor types that undergo endocytosis when stimulated by exogenous ligands. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">AdV Internalization into HeLa Cell-Lines with Competent and Defective Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Adenoviral entry into cells may reflect uptake by a number of cellular pathways i.e., receptor-mediated endocytosis via coated pits, non-specific pinocytosis, or phagocytosis. (R. M. Steinman et al., J. Cell Biol. 96, 1-27.) The role of coated-pit receptor-mediated endocytosis and non-specific pinocytosis on AdV-entry into cell-lines which have either competent or defective receptor-mediated endocytosis is studied. HeLa cell mutants have been produced which can overexpress either wild-type dynamin protein or a mutant form, mDyn (controlled by a TET-inducible promoter). (H. Damke et al., J. Cell Biol. 127, 915-934.) Normally, dynamin is responsible for coated pit endosome formation and functions by &lsquo;pinching&rsquo; off invaginations in the plasma membrane. HeLa cells overexpressing wild-type dynamin show no functional or morphological alteration of uptake processes compared to parent cells. Cells overexpressing nmDyn form coated pits and invaginate the plasma membrane but fail to bud coated vesicles into the cytoplasm. Ligands for receptor-mediated endocytosis (EGF and transferrin) fail to be internalized into cells expressing niDyn, but ligand-receptor binding, coated pit assembly, recruitment of receptors into coated pits and invagination of the plasma membrane are all unaffected. In the absence of receptor-mediated endocytosis, non-specific pinocytosis initially remains unaltered but with time is upregulated to compensate for the loss of receptor-mediated endocytosis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> HeLa cells either overexpressing wild-type or mDyn (gift of Sandra Schmid, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) are used to study the uptake processes that are prevalent for AdV-entry into these cells. A range of AdV concentrations are studied to determine if high titre AdV leads to cell-uptake by non-specific processes. Briefly, monolayers of mutant HeLa cells, grown on plastic, expressing wild-type or mdyn dynamin will be exposed to Ad5VLacZ (10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>-10<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>i.u./ml, corresponding to an MOI&tilde;1-10<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>) at 4&deg; C. for 2 hrs and then transferred, without washing, to 37&deg; C. for time-periods of 0-24 hr, at which point the cells will be washed and maintained at 37&deg; C. for 48 hrs before &bgr;-gal enzymatic assays are performed. Differences in the gene expression observed in the two cell-lines at specific time-points will reflect the participation of receptor-mediated endocytosis on AdV-entry. In conjunction, comparative studies with fluorescent microspheres (with and without attached knob-protein) to delineate the interaction of these proteins with specific and non-specific uptake processes are also conducted. </paragraph>
