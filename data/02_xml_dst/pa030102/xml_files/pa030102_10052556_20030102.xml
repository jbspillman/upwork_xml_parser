<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a method for intermediary trading between a building materials manufacturer and a fabrication factory, in which a building materials fabrication intermediating service is applied to a construction business. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For example, conventionally, a builder first makes an order to a construction company. When the construction company receives the order made by the builder, the construction company determines building materials necessary for contents of an order received, and then makes an order of building materials that are determined, to a building materials wholesaler. When the building materials wholesaler receives the order of the building materials, the building materials wholesaler selects a building materials manufacturer for each building-material indicated in the order received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> After that, the building materials wholesaler, which received the order of the building materials from the building materials, ships the building materials to the construction company. The construction company receives the building materials and then manufactures the building materials based on contents of the order received from the builder. When the construction company completes to manufacture the building materials, the construction company ships to a construction location and completes a construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to procedures described above, since the construction company is required to manufacture the building materials received from the building materials wholesaler, the construction company needs a factory. Instead of having a factory, the construction company may make an order of fabrication to a fabrication factory. However, in this case, it is difficult for the fabrication factory to deliver manufactured building materials on time ordered by the construction company because of various order contents and a different order amount every time. </paragraph>

The construction company is authenticated by sending the construction company ID and the construction company password from the construction company terminal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a receiving process is conducted for order received information. The construction company, that is authenticated by the authentication process in the step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, selects information concerning building materials to be ordered and information concerning a fabrication to be ordered, and sends selection results from the construction company terminal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to the building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Then, the receive program <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> receives the selection results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, an ordering customer retrieving process is conducted. Based on the selection results as the order received information received in the step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the ordering customer retrieval program <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> selects an optimal fabrication factory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a sending process is conducted for order information. The send program <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> sends order information for an order of the building materials to the building materials manufacturer terminal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and also sends order information for the order of the fabrication of the building materials to the fabrication factory terminal <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Each process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> First, the authentication process for the construction company in the step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> will be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, the construction company terminal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> sends login information to the building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. An ordering person of the construction company enters the construction company ID and the construction company password into the construction company terminal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and sends the login information to the building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, the building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> receives the login information sent in the step S<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the construction company file <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is searched for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An example of the construction company file <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a construction company file <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The construction company file <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> includes a construction company ID for identifying the construction company, a password for authenticating the construction company, a company name, and a telephone number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> retrieves the construction company file <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> by the construction company ID included in the login information received in the step S<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as a find key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a determination step is conducted to determine one of branched steps based on a retrieval result of the step S<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. As a result, when construction company information matches with the find key and a password in the construction company information matches with a password included in the login information, the authentication process is successfully completed. That is, the authentication process in the step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is completed for the construction company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> However, as the retrieval result in the step S<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, when there is no construction company information matching with the find key, or when there is the construction company information matching with the find key but the password indicated in the construction company information does not match with the password in the login information, the authentication process is abnormally ended. Then, the building materials fabrication intermediating system advances to step S<highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the step S<highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> sends a request of resending the login information to the construction company terminal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In this case, the following steps are not executed and the ordering person of the construction company is required to resend the login information to the building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The receiving process for the order received information in the step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> will now be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In a step S<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the building materials fabrication intermediating system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> displays an order information selecting window at the construction company terminal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. An example of the order information selecting window is illustrated as an order information selecting window <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The order information selecting window <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> includes a header <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>A, a body <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>B, and a footer <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>C. The header <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>A shows the construction company ID that the construction company terminal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> entered to login, the construction company name obtained by retrieving the construction company file <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> by the construction company ID as the find key. </paragraph>
