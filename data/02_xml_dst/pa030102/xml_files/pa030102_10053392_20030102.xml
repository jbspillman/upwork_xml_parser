<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to self-propelled, ground-working vehicles such as lawn mowers and, more particularly, to operator control systems for use with the same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various types of lawn mowers are known. For example, small, walk-behind mowers are in general use by both homeowners and professionals alike. At the other end of the spectrum are large, riding mowers adept at mowing correspondingly large and typically unobstructed areas. Between these two categories lies what is commonly referred to as &ldquo;mid-size&rdquo; mowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, mid-size mowers are self-propelled units having a cutting width of approximately 32-60 inches. While they may be configured as either riding (including ride-on and ride-behind) or walk-behind units, walk-behind mowers potentially offer greater maneuverability. For example, walk-behind mowers are particularly efficient when mowing large lawns having numerous obstacles (e.g., trees, shrubs, flowerbeds, and the like) which necessitate intricate trimming, or when mowing lawns which may otherwise be ill-suited to high-speed riding mowers. Moreover, walk-behind mowers are often used in areas with steep slopes which may pose traction or tipping problems for riding mowers. Furthermore, mid-size, walk-behind mowers are also, in general, less expensive than riding mowers. While the present invention is directed to control systems for use with either riding or walk-behind vehicles, it will, for the sake of brevity, be described with respect to mid-size, walk-behind mowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One type of control system known for use with mid-size mowers uses two rearwardly extending handles each equipped with a scissors-type lever. Each lever operatively controls one of two drive wheels typically located at or near the rear corners of the cutting unit. Where the levers are configured as &ldquo;normally engaged,&rdquo; actuating (e.g., squeezing) one of the drive levers causes disengagement and/or braking of the corresponding drive wheel, permitting the mower to turn about that wheel. Alternatively, the levers may be &ldquo;normally disengaged&rdquo; such that actuating (e.g., squeezing) one of the drive levers causes engagement of the corresponding drive wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While scissors-type lever control systems are more than adequate for their intended purpose, drawbacks remain. For instance, scissors-type levers, in general, may provide limited mechanical advantage in overcoming lever tension. Accordingly, when cutting a lawn with many trees, shrubs, or other obstacles that necessitate numerous turns, discomfort in the hands, wrists, and arms may occur. Scissors-type lever control systems may also be susceptible to variation in lever tension over the lever travel. Furthermore, depending on the position of each lever within its throw, the operator may not be able to grasp the respective lever with all fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other systems are also known. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,511,367 to Powers et al. and 5,809,755 to Velke et al. disclose control systems having a generally horizontal, transverse hand position. While addressing some of the above-identified problems, other issues with hand position and/or control actuation potentially remain. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Control systems of the present invention seek to overcome the above-identified drawbacks by providing natural hand positioning with conveniently located drive control levers. Control systems in accordance with the present invention further provide a hand position interior to the control system to reduce potential contact between the operator&apos;s hands and external objects during operation. The drive control levers of the present invention may additionally provide substantially constant tension throughout their range of motion, resulting in drive control lever forces which are more evenly distributed throughout the operator&apos;s hands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an operator control system for a self-propelled vehicle is provided. The operator control system includes a handle assembly including a first hand grip having a first grip axis and a second hand grip having a second grip axis. The first grip axis and the second grip axis extend upwardly and toward one another when the vehicle is in an operating configuration. A first control lever associated with the first hand grip is also included. The first control lever is pivotable about a first pivot axis, wherein the first pivot axis is substantially parallel to the first grip axis of the first hand grip. A latching device associated with the first control lever is also included and is adapted to latch the first control lever in two or more positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, an operator control system for a self-propelled vehicle is provided and includes a handle assembly including a first hand grip having a first grip axis and a second hand grip having a second grip axis. The first grip axis and the second grip axis extend upwardly, forwardly, and toward one another when the vehicle is in an operating configuration. Also provided is a first control lever associated with the first hand grip. The first control lever is pivotable about a first pivot axis, wherein the first pivot axis is substantially parallel to the first grip axis of the first hand grip. A latching device associated with the first control lever is also included. The latching device is operable to latch the first control lever in two or more positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, a method for controlling a self-propelled vehicle is provided. The method includes providing an operator control system including a handle assembly having a first hand grip with a first grip axis and a second hand grip with a second grip axis. The first grip axis and the second grip axis extend upwardly and toward one another when the vehicle is in an operating configuration. A first control lever associated with the first hand grip is also included. The first control lever is pivotable about a first pivot axis, wherein the first pivot axis is substantially parallel to the first grip axis of the first hand grip. The handle assembly also includes a first latching device associated with the first control lever, where the first latching device is operable to latch the first control lever in at least a first position and a second position. The method also includes: grasping the first control lever with an operator&apos;s first hand; manipulating the first control lever to the first position with the operator&apos;s first hand; and manipulating the first latching device to latch the first control lever in the first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In still yet another embodiment, an operator control system for a self-propelled power mower is provided. In this embodiment, the control system may include a handle assembly including a first hand grip having a first grip axis and a second hand grip having a second grip axis. The first grip axis and the second grip axis are substantially coplanar and extend upwardly, forwardly, and toward one another when the mower is in an operating configuration. The control system may also include a first control lever associated with the first hand grip, where the first control lever is pivotable about a first pivot axis, the first pivot axis being substantially parallel to the first grip axis of the first hand grip. A first latching device including a generally hook-shaped member pivotally coupled to the first hand grip is also included. The first latching device is operable to pivot about an axis generally coaxial with the first grip axis. The first latching device is adapted to latch the first control lever in at least a first position and a second position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The above summary of the invention is not intended to describe each embodiment or every implementation of the present invention. Rather, a more complete understanding of the invention will become apparent and appreciated by reference to the following detailed description and claims in view of the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description of the embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an operator control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention as the latter may be incorporated on a self-propelled vehicle, e.g., a mid-size, walk-behind lawn mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. While, for the sake of brevity, the invention is herein described with respect to a particular mid-size, walk-behind lawn mower (hereinafter generically referred to merely as &ldquo;walk-behind mower,&rdquo; or, more generally, as &ldquo;mower&rdquo;), those of skill in the art will realize that the invention is equally applicable to other walk-behind mowers, ride-behind mowers (e.g., such as those utilizing sulkies), and conventional ride-on mowers as well as to most any other walk-behind, ride-behind, or ride-on self-propelled, ground working vehicle, e.g., skid-steer loader, aerator, snow thrower, tiller, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the general construction of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is not considered central to the invention, it will now be briefly described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (shown primarily in broken lines) having a frame <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> supporting a prime mover, e.g., internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A pair of transversely opposing, ground engaging drive wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (only left wheel visible) may support the rear of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in rolling engagement with the ground. Each drive wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be powered by a hydraulic motor (not shown) which receives hydraulic power from a hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) under the control of various operator-controlled valves. The hydraulic pumps <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, in turn, may be separately powered by the engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Other drive systems, e.g., gear or pulley driven systems (examples of which are described below), are also within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Operator controls, as further described below, permit independent control of the speed and direction of each drive wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, allowing control of mower speed and direction from a walking or riding position generally aft, e.g., behind, the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A pair of front swiveling caster wheels <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which are preferably connected to forwardly extending frame rails <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, may support the front of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in rolling engagement with the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As used herein, relative terms such as &ldquo;left,&rdquo; &ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;fore,&rdquo; &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; &ldquo;aft,&rdquo; &ldquo;rearward,&rdquo; &ldquo;top,&rdquo; &ldquo;bottom,&rdquo; &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;lower,&rdquo; &ldquo;horizontal,&rdquo; &ldquo;vertical,&rdquo; and the like are from the perspective of one operating the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> while the mower is in an operating configuration, e.g., while the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is positioned such that the wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> rest upon a generally horizontal ground surface as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. These terms are used herein to simplify the description, however, and not to limit the scope of the invention in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Although the illustrated mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has the drive wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the rear and the caster wheels <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in front, this configuration is not limiting. For example, other embodiments may reverse the location of the wheels, e.g., drive wheels in front and caster wheels in back. Moreover, other configurations may use different wheel configurations altogether, e.g., a tri-wheel configuration. These and other embodiments are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A cutting deck <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be mounted to a lower side of the frame <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> generally between the drive wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the caster wheels <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The cutting deck <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes one or more cutting blades (not shown) as known in the art which are operatively powered by the engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. During operation, power is selectively delivered to the cutting deck <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, whereby the blades rotate at a speed sufficient to sever grass and other vegetation passing underneath the cutting deck. The cutting deck <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may optionally include deck rollers <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to further support the cutting deck relative to the ground during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the operator control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include a first hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. To support the operator control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, one or more structural members such as arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may extend between the frame <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, e.g., the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may extend upwardly and rearwardly from the frame <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). While shown and described as arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, most any comparable structure is possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, plate and/or sheet metal structures may be used in place of, or in addition to, the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The suffixes &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo; are used throughout this description to denote various left and right side parts/features, respectively. However, in most pertinent respects, the parts/features denoted with &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo; suffixes are either substantially identical to, or mirror images of, one another. Therefore, such items may, where appropriate, be referred to generically or collectively without the suffix, e.g., &ldquo;hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>&rdquo; may refer to either or both hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. It is understood that, unless otherwise noted, the description of an individual part/feature, e.g., the description of a part/feature identified with an &ldquo;a&rdquo; suffix, also applies to the opposing part/feature, e.g., the part/feature identified with a &ldquo;b&rdquo; suffix. Similarly, the description of a part/feature identified with no suffix applies to both the corresponding left and right part/feature, e.g., to both the part/feature identified with the &ldquo;a&rdquo; suffix and the &ldquo;b&rdquo; suffix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> form ends of a continuous handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> which may also include a substantially transverse tube member or portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and curved portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As the figures illustrate, the curved portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may result in a generally bull-horn shaped handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The bull-horn shape of the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> yields hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that are preferably generally inclined upwardly and toward one another. In other words, a first grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may approach a second grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a point above the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Preferably, although not necessarily, the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are generally straight and lie within a common plane (e.g., the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be coplanar with the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In embodiments where the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> do lie within the same plane, the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may intersect the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a point above the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. While not limited thereto, the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of each hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be inclined at an angle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of 30 degrees to 60 degrees and, more preferably, at an angle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of 30 to 40 degrees, measured from a respective line <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> formed by the intersection of the plane of the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a vertical plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may also be inclined forwardly relative to a vertical plane passing through a lowermost portion of the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, e.g., passing through a lowermost portion of the first hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as generally indicated in the figures (see e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). While not limited thereto, some embodiments may be configured with the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> inclined forwardly from the vertical plane at an angle <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) of between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and, more preferably, at an angle <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> between 30 degrees and 40 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As those of skill in the art will realize, the shape and orientation of the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, e.g., the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, provide the operator with comfortable hand positioning during operation (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Further, by positioning the operator&apos;s hands interior to the periphery of the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, e.g., inboard or interior to the curved portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the chance of inadvertent contact between the hands and obstacles during operation may be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may attach to the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in any number of ways. For example, the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may be welded to the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may be fastened to the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> using, for example, mechanical fasteners, adhesives, or the like. In still other embodiments, the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed with the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, e.g., the ends of arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may form the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In the case of the latter, the transverse tube portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the curved portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, or both, may be optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Various control devices are mounted on or in close proximity to the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For example, a transmission lever <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be provided to allow drive parameter selection, e.g., forward speed, while a throttle <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be provided to control engine speed. Other controls not central to the invention, e.g., starter, choke, etc., although not illustrated, may also be provided. A cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be further included to offer a more aesthetically pleasing appearance as well as to shield various moving parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> To control power delivery to the drive wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the operator control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> preferably includes a first control lever, e.g., a first drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a second control lever, e.g., a second drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. The drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are coupled to respective hydraulic pumps <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> via tie rods <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. When a drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is manipulated as described below, the corresponding tie rod <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> pivots a lever arm <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> on the pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, manipulating a hydraulic valve (not shown) which controls hydraulic flow to the respective drive wheel motor (also not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> preferably has a shape similar to the corresponding hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, e</cross-reference>.g., the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, similar to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, may have a grip portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>defining a lever axis <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>substantially parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Optionally, each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may include a curved portion <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> having a shape that generally corresponds to the shape of the respective curved portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, e.g., curved portion <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may have generally the same radius of curvature as the respective curved portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. While the grip portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is described and illustrated as straight, other shapes are also possible without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may pivotally couple to the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (e.g., to the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> or, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, to the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>) via a pivot assembly <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the pivot assembly <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> permits pivoting of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> about an axis substantially parallel to the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, e.g., the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>pivots about a pivot axis <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is substantially parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The tie rod <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is coupled to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> at a tie rod pivot <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>) located a predetermined distance from the pivot axis <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to provide the desired tie rod movement for a given drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Because of the substantially parallel orientation of the pivot axis <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to the axes <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, the lever axis <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> remains generally parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> throughout the range of motion of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., the grip portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>remains parallel to its respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As a result, the force required to manipulate each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is substantially uniform throughout the travel of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Moreover, because the lever axis <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the operator is able to grasp the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with most, if not all, fingers (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) regardless of the particular position of the drive control lever within its travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> To further improve operator comfort during mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> use, each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may have a cross section defined by one or more curved surfaces. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary grip portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a curved, e.g., convex or semi-cylindrical, surface <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and a generally planar surface <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Other embodiments may include a concave surface in place of the planar surface <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> such that the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> corresponds to the shape of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is proximate thereto. Other embodiments may vary the shape or the radius of curvature of the curved surface <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the curved surface <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> permits grasping by the operator without resulting in excessive pressure at any point along the operator&apos;s fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also illustrates the range of motion of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In this figure, the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is illustrated in solid lines in a forward position identified as &ldquo;F.&rdquo; Preferably, the drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are biased toward the forward position F. The forward position F corresponds to the respective hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) providing maximum hydraulic flow for forward motion of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may also be movable to a reverse position &ldquo;R&rdquo; by squeezing the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, toward the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, e.g., hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The reverse position R corresponds to the respective hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) providing maximum hydraulic flow for reverse motion of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may also be movable to any position between the forward position F and the reverse position R. In some embodiments, the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, when in an intermediate or neutral position, e.g., a position identified as N in broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, may place the respective hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in a static configuration. That is, when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is in the neutral position N, differential flow output from the pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> may be effectively terminated such that no driving power is delivered to the respective drive wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the neutral position N could configure internal valving of the respective hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> into a cross-ported configuration such that the respective drive wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> could freewheel without substantial hydraulic resistance. As a result, the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could, when both drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are in the neutral position N, be moved without starting the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, drive control systems in accordance with the present invention provide intuitive control of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For instance, incremental forward movement of both drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from the neutral position N to the forward position F results in forward propulsion of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at incrementally increasing speed. Similarly, incremental rearward motion of both drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from the neutral position N to the reverse position R results in incrementally increasing reverse speed. By manipulating the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>independently between the forward position F and the reverse position R, the operator can control both speed and direction of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, while one drive control lever, e.g., <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, may be commanded for mower movement in a first direction at a first speed, the opposite drive control lever, e.g., <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, may be commanded for mower movement in the same or opposite direction at the same or different speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Some embodiments of the present invention may optionally include a latching device, e.g., a neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, of which one configuration is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> permits the operator to temporarily lock the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in at least one predetermined position, e.g., in the neutral position N. By permitting locking of each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in the neutral position N, the operator may suspend operation and release one or more secondary levers, e.g., an operator presence control (hereinafter &ldquo;OPC&rdquo;) lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> further described below, without inadvertently stopping the engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrate end views of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>showing the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> in various positions relative to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also preferably includes a neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> (see e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) which operates in a manner generally identical to that described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments illustrated herein, the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is pivotable about an end of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, e.g., about a latch pivot axis <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> which may be generally parallel and preferably coaxial to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), between a locked position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and an unlocked position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may include a hook portion <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> for capturing the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>when the latter is in the first or neutral position N as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. To disengage the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> from the locked position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it may be manually pivoted about the latch pivot axis <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> in a direction <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> to the unlocked position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. While the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, may be configured with an outwardly opening mouth, other embodiments may utilize a neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> having an inwardly opening mouth as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. To assist the operator with pivoting the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, thumb tabs <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> may be included. Optionally, a friction-reducing member/device, e.g., a roller <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, may be provided to assist with moving the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> relative to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> To provide rotational resistance to the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, a friction device (not shown) may be incorporated. For example, the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may be fastened to the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a fastener and one or more spring disc washers as known in the art. By controlling the installation torque of the fastener, the axial clamping force applied to the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> by the spring washers may be varied, thus altering the resistance of the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> to rotational movement. Other friction devices may also be used without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Once the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is moved to the unlocked position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is free to move to the forward position F as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. A pivot limiting device, e.g., ear <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, may be included with the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> to prevent engagement of the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, e.g., rotation of the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> in the direction <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight>, when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is in the forward position F. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates the relative locations of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is in the reverse position R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of operator control systems in accordance with the present invention may further include one or more operator presence control (OPC) devices as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. OPC devices are typically configured to terminate mower operation, e.g., stop the engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in some circumstances unless operator presence is detected. In the instant invention, the OPC device may be configured as one or more secondary or OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> positioned proximate the respective hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> opposite the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., aft of the hand grip. Like the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, each OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may include a generally straight gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and a curved portion <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and the curved portion <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> have shapes that may generally correspond to that of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the curved portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention may operatively couple to an interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> (as known in the art and diagrammatically represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) and manipulate the same between an open configuration and a closed configuration. Generally speaking, mower, e.g., engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, operation is disabled when the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> is in its open configuration and enabled when the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> is in its closed configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are preferably biased toward a disengaged, normally open position identified as &ldquo;O&rdquo; in broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The open position O preferably corresponds to the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> being in its open configuration (mower disabled). To operate the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, at least one of the OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be squeezed toward the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to a closed, e.g., engaged, position identified as &ldquo;C&rdquo; in solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The closed position C preferably corresponds to the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> being in its closed configuration (mower enabled). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be movable between the open position O and the closed position C by pivoting about an OPC pivot <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> having a pivot axis <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> that is generally transverse to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The gripping portions <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> may each, in some embodiments, define a secondary lever axis <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> (see e.g., axis <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) which is substantially parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> when the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is in the closed position C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Preferably, one OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is associated with each hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, e.g., OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be provided as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may further be configured such that they form a single lever. As a result, the operator may engage the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> with one OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, e.g., the interlock switch may be engaged by holding either one or both OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the closed position C (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). However, should the operator release both levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, they will return to their open position O, opening the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> and thus disabling the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, e.g., engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, from further operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Like the drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be configured to assist in reducing operator fatigue. For example, the cross-sectional shape of at least the gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> (see e.g., <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) may be configured to generally correspond to the exterior profile of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may include a rigid or semi-rigid core portion <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> which, in one embodiment, is made from steel or aluminum. To provide more comfortable gripping, the core portion <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may optionally be surrounded, at least in part, by a gripping layer <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>. While not limited thereto, the gripping layer <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> may preferably be made from a compressible material such as foam rubber. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates, the gripping layer <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> defines an outer radius <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may define a cross-sectional shape having a surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> which preferably conforms to a cross-sectional shape of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> when the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is in the closed position C (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). In the illustrated embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, the surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> is concave having an inner radius <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> generally equal in size to the outer radius <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. As a result, the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> contacts the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> along most, if not all, of the surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be further defined by a convex surface <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> having a radius <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the radius <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> of the convex surface <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> is less than the radius of the concave surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>, e.g., the radii <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> have different centers. This geometry yields a crescent-shaped cross-section as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. To avoid sharp edges and to provide a smooth transition to the gripping layer <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>, the two surfaces <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> may blend together at a radius <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Providing an OPC cross-sectional shape as described above and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> results in generally smooth transition zones from the edges of the gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Also, the eccentric surfaces <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> result in the OPC lever gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> having a non-uniform thickness, e.g., being somewhat thicker near its middle than near its edges (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). The thicker middle portion provides the operator with a protrusion to grip during operation while the thinner edges provide a gradual transition from the gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As a result, the transition from the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> produces relatively few pressure points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the embodiments described and illustrated herein are exemplary only. Other configurations are certainly possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may have different cross-sectional shapes, e.g., an oval. When so configured, various corresponding surfaces, e.g., the surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) and/or the surface <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) may be reconfigured to correspond to the new cross-sectional shape of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may also be configured to pivot about an axis generally parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) rather than about the transverse axis <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments, an operator control system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be configured such that a drive control lever <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is located aft of, i.e., behind, the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The drive control lever <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may still pivot about a pivot assembly <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> having a pivot axis substantially parallel to an axis of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Movement of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may reposition the tie rod <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> as described above. While not shown, neutral locks and OPC levers may be reconfigured to accommodate this revised drive control lever structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> While described above specifically with application to hydraulically-powered mowers, the present invention is equally applicable to vehicles utilizing other drive systems. For example, a walk-behind power mower <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> using a gear drive system, an exemplary embodiment of which is partially illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, may also utilize a control system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention (for clarity, only the right side of the mower <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is illustrated in this view). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be similar in many respects to the control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> described and illustrated herein. For example, it may include hand grips <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, drive control levers <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, and OPC levers <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> having generally the same configuration and functionality as that of the respective corresponding hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The exemplary gear drive system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> uses a driving pulley <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> powered by a prime mover (not shown) which is supported by a frame <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of the mower <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. An endless belt <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> may transmit power from the driving pulley <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to a driven pulley <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the latter being attached to the respective drive wheel <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> (right drive wheel removed for clarity in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). A gear selector (not shown) may be provided to permit selection of driving speed and direction (forward, reverse) of the driving pulley <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An idler pulley <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> selectively tensions the belt <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> in response to operator manipulation of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. For example, when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is manipulated to a forward position F (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>), e.g., a position generally similar to the forward position F of lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> tie rod <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> causes a bell crank <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) to pivot about a pivot <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> in a first direction <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. Movement of the bell crank <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> in the first direction <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> causes the idler pulley <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to tension the belt <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, providing driving power to the drive wheel. Thus, the forward position F of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> corresponds to the respective drive wheel of the mower being configured for driving operation (either forward or rearward movement, depending on the position of the transmission gear selector). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The bell crank <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is preferably biased in the first direction <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> by a spring (not shown) or other similar device such that the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is biased toward the forward position F (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> When the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is moved from the forward position F to a first or neutral position N (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>), e.g., to a position generally similar to the neutral position N of lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the tie rod <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> causes the bell crank <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to pivot about the pivot <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> in a second direction <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. Motion of the bell crank <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> in the second direction <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> causes the idler pulley <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to move away from the belt <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. With belt tension relaxed, power to the drive wheel <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> is reduced or terminated. Thus, the neutral position N of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> corresponds to the respective drive wheel <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> being in a neutral configuration, i.e., providing substantially no power or braking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Preferably, further movement of the bell crank <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> in the direction <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, e.g., movement of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to a second or &ldquo;park&rdquo; position &ldquo;P&rdquo; (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 19</cross-reference>), may engage a wheel brake <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. While not limited to any particular configuration, the wheel brake <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> may be a friction band brake or other brake mechanism known in the art, e.g., a disk brake. To engage the wheel brake <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, the bell crank <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> may be coupled thereto, e.g., via a linkage <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, such that movement of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to the park position P results in braking of the respective drive wheel <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>. Thus, the park position P of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> corresponds to the respective drive wheel <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> being in a park (e.g., braked) configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may also include a latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> (shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>) similar in most respects to the latching device <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> described herein and illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiments, the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> includes a pivoting, generally hook-shaped latch member <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight>. However, other shapes are certainly possible. In fact, the term &ldquo;latching device&rdquo; may include most any device operable to substantially retain the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in a predetermined position until intentionally released (or otherwise manipulated) by the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> illustrate end views of one hand grip <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> showing the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> and drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in various configurations. While only the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> associated with one hand grip (the right-hand grip) of the control system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> for the opposite hand grip (the left-hand grip) is substantially the same, e.g., a mirror image, unless otherwise described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is pivotable about a latch pivot axis <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> that is preferably parallel and coincident (coaxial) to a grip axis of the hand grip <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> (much like the latch pivot axis <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> of the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). The latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> may include a first lever seating surface <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> to assist in securely latching the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> when the latter is in the neutral position N as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. That is, when the latching device is engaged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is latched in the neutral position N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> To disengage the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> from the neutral position N, the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> may be pivoted about the pivot axis <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> in a direction <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> to a disengaged (unlatched) position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. To assist the operator with pivoting the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, tabs, e.g., thumb tabs <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>, which may be manipulated with the operator&apos;s thumb or other finger, may be included. An optional, friction-reducing member/device, e.g., a roller <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>), may be provided to assist with moving the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> relative to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Similarly, as with the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, a device (not shown) may be included to provide rotational resistance of the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Once again, while illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with an outwardly opening mouth <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> (i.e., the opening formed by the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> opens toward the outside of the mower <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>), other embodiments may utilize a latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> having an inwardly opening mouth <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> similar to the embodiment of the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Once the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is moved to the disengaged position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is free to move from the neutral position N toward either the park position P of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> or toward the forward position F of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> (the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may also be moved between the neutral position N of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> and the park position P of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> while the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> remains in the engaged position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> To improve latching of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> when the latter is in the park position P, the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> may include a second lever seating surface <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> as identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 17</cross-reference>. A discontinuity, e.g., raised portion <highlight><bold>483</bold></highlight>, preferably exists between the first seating surface <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> and the second seating surface <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight>. The discontinuity adequately isolates the two seating surfaces <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>481</bold></highlight> and provides more positive latching of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in either of the selected positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> When the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is moved to the forward position F as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, an optional pivot limiting device, e.g., ear <highlight><bold>482</bold></highlight>, may prevent engagement of the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, e.g., limit rotation of the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> in the direction <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> illustrates the relative locations of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is in the park position P and the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is disengaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Thus, the latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> permits latching of each drive control lever <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in two or more positions, e.g., in a neutral position N (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) and in a park position P (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>). Identifying indicia <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>) may be included on each latching device <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> to assist the operator in quickly identifying latching device positions. For example, indicia <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may include the letter &ldquo;N&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;NEUTRAL&rdquo; (or some equivalent) while indicia <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may include the letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;PARK&rdquo; (or some equivalent). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Different indicia may be used to indicate other positions. For example, some embodiments may utilize latching devices having additional (e.g., three) or different latching positions. In this case, specific identifying indicia corresponding to these additional/different latching positions may be provided without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The invention is not limited to the embodiments described above as other configurations are certainly also possible within the scope of the invention. For example, other embodiments may have hand grips configured to extend downwardly and outwardly rather than upwardly and inwardly. That is, the hand grips may couple to the mower at or near their uppermost end and extend downwardly and outwardly therefrom. However, such embodiments may still result in grip axes, e.g., axes <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), that approach and/or intersect one another above the grip assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described above. Other variations, modifications, and combinations of the various parts and assemblies can certainly be made and still fall within the scope of the invention. Thus, the invention is limited only by the following claims, and equivalents thereto. </paragraph>
