<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A computer interface card is locked to a wire outlet of a computer casing by a metal isolating piece. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the isolating piece A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of an interface card A has an inverse L shape. A top thereof is formed above a platform B of the wire outlet, and then is locked by screws. This fixing way is a standard form and has been used for a long time. However, in this way, each interface card is locked by one action. Therefore, the operation is too complex in assembly. In general, as an interface card is added, a screw is necessary to fix it. When the motherboard or a casing is necessary to be updated, all the screws must be detached one by one. It is time-consumed and thus cost in assembly is increased. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an exploded perspective view of the present invention is illustrated. In the present invention, a press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is installed on the positioning platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the wire outlet of a computer casing <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a rectangular shape having a width approximately equal to that of the positioning platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to exactly press an interface isolating piece <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the positioning platform <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A top surface of the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed with two symmetrical cambered grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Two ends at the top surface of the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are extended with retaining plates <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Each plate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is installed with a round fixing hole <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. The surface of the casing above the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed with round positioning holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a position respective to the cambered grooves <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The edge of each positioning hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is extended with an annular edges <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. The annular edge <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is exactly engaged with a cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that the pivot shaft of the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may pass through the hole to be engaged to a female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. A projection <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed on the plate aside the positioning hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> partial cross section view of the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is illustrated. It is shown that a ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> protrudes from the axial portion of the cam <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The inner diameter of the ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is exactly equal to the outer diameter of the annular edge <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is exactly pivotally engaged to the annular edge <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. A center of the ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is protruded with a hexagonal cylinder <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. A pair of arrow-like hooks <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are extended from two opposite sides of the hexagonal cylinder <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The bodies of the hooks are at the same plane of the hexagonal cylinder <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is mainly formed by a round disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a rod portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is connected to the round disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the rod <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and at a center therebetween. The center of the round disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has a hexagonal hole <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> which extends to the shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The peripheral edge of the round disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is formed with concave holes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> positioned with respect to the projections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the casing. One end of the shaft <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> near the rod portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed with two notches <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> at positions with respect to the hooks <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. When the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted into the hexagonal hole <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by the hexagonal cylinder <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> thereof. The books <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are ejected out from the notches <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight> so as to position the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are formed as an integral body. Now, the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are at two sides of the surface of the casing. Then, by moving the rod portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the female rod <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will rotate synchronously. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an assembly view of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> schematic view showing the operation of the present invention is illustrated. It is shown that the round disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is tightly adhered to an inner side of the surface of the casing. The disk <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> clamp the surface. At this time, the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is exactly above the cambered groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the cam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is rotated to a horizontal direction. Then, the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will release from the cam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Thus, the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be taken down for installing an interface card. When the rod portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is rotated so that the cam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> moves downwards (referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), since the width of the cam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is slightly smaller than that of the cambered groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the cam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be embedded into the cambered groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and presses the cambered edge of the cambered groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so as to form a downward pressure. Since the concave holes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are engaged with the projections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the surface of the casing, the cam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> will not slide out of the cambered groove <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The four holes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may provide a 90 degree positioning for the rotation of the female seat <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the cam button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, to enhance the pressure of the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, screw holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be formed on the surface of the casing at a position corresponding to the fixing holes <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Thereby, screws may pass through the screw holes for fixing the two components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the present invention, by the press strip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, all the interface cards can be fixed at one time. It is unnecessary to detach screws one by one. All the interface cards can be mounted or detached by fixing the press strip easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the details described thereof. Various substitutions and modifications have been suggested in the foregoing description, and others will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, all such substitutions and modifications are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
