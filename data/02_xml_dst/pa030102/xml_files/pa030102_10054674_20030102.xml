<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions that provide film layers to the human skin and its appendages. The film layers include or enhance coloring of, for example, lips and hair including brows and lashes. It is generally in a liquid form but may be modified to provide a balm with or without colors. Cosmetic compositions of the present invention include lip coloring compositions with or without enhancing agents, and formulations for removing the color. The present invention also relates to methods of using the compositions, and kits containing a plurality of the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Cosmetics have been a part of man&apos;s history. Coloring, enhancing, and conditioning hair, skin and nails have been goals through the ages. But in general, discoveries in cosmetics have been disjointed and without direction or general plans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For example, lipstick has been utilized as a cosmetic preparation for heightening or altering the color of lips. Conventional lipstick is formed by a cosmetic coloring in a wax carrier. Although lipstick has many disadvantages, there has thus far been no suitable alternatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The lipsticks which have heretofore been available have the marked disadvantage of being readily transferable from a person&apos;s lips to other objects. Lipstick smears and rubs off while swimming, smoking, kissing, or by any other contact of the lips with articles such as coffee cups, tea cups, napkins and clothing. This leads to the loss of the lipstick application when drinking beverages, when swimming, and even when in engaging in none of these activities due simply to licking the lips. Thus, while lipstick is normally initially applies in a relatively even application across the externally exposed areas of the lips, the application of lipstick will readily dissipate and assumes a nonuniform coverage. The greatest loss of the lipstick application is typically near the portions of the lips closest to a person&apos;s mouth. As a consequence, it is necessary to frequently reapply layers of lipstick in order to maintain a uniform coverage of a lipstick application on a person&apos;s lips. This frequent necessity for reapplication aggravates a further disadvantage of conventional lipstick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Lipstick has the additional disadvantage of being susceptible to cracking and caking. This disadvantage is particularly pronounced when several layers of lipstick have been applied to attempt to replenish a lipstick application that has been lost due to transfer to other articles. As a consequence, the frequent reapplication of lipstick results in perceptible cracking and caking of the lipstick covering a person&apos;s lips. Caking and cracking of a lipstick application detracts from the natural appearance of the lips and is aesthetically undesirable. Use of shellacs and waxes as major ingredients of lip stick increases the risk of cracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Similar problems attend the coloring of hair such as eyebrows and eyelashes. With regard to nails, nail polishes and enamels do not generally smear, but products available are harsh, e.g. contain acetone. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A basic cosmetic composition of the present invention includes a film forming agent that may be contacted to human skin and its appendages including lips, hair including eyebrows and lashes, and nails. The film forming agent is a resin that is soluble in an organic solvent and insoluble in water. It is preferably prepared for use in the invention by combination with an organic solvent. The basic cosmetic composition by itself can be spread on human skin and its appendages to protect it, condition it and effect a shine. The basic cosmetic composition can also be used to alter a liquid cosmetic for coloring the lips of the present invention. An aspect of this use of the composition is to lighten the lip color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention presents a unified approach to conditioning and enhancing or coloring human skin and appendages by using a basic cosmetic composition that is a film forming agent, with combined pigment, natural extracts, enhancing agents, and the like. Included are innovative alternatives to lipstick. An embodiment of a lip cosmetic of the present invention used to apply color to the lips does not take the form of a gooey stick, but rather is a unique, smear-proof and waterproof liquid that dries quickly to an extremely sheer, soft finish that feels remarkably like bare skin. The lip cosmetic also is formed into a balm. In one embodiment, the resin of the present invention is present at 0.05-50% (preferably&tilde;6%) the organic solvent at 30-90%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a lip coloring cosmetic includes at least 1% of a resin, for example, between about 0.1 and about 20 parts of a film forming resin, that is soluble in an organic solvent but insoluble in water, optionally between about 0.1 and about 15 parts of a cellulose, between about 0.1 and about 15 parts of a cosmetic pigment, and between about 50 and 99 parts of an organic solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The alcohol soluble, water insoluble resin which is employed is the critical component that provides the cosmetic of the invention with its numerous advantages over lipstick. Although AMPHOMER is preferably utilized as the requisite alcohol soluble, water insoluble resin, other film-forming agents may be used not only to add a white component of color, but also to serve as a sunscreen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> If the basic cosmetic is to be used on facial skin, oils, triglyceride, panthenol, propylene glycol or a mixture thereof, glyceryl esters and derivatives, panthenol, esters and fatty acids, fatty alcohols, unsaponifables or silicone may be combined up to &tilde;40% (preferred up to &tilde;5%). Ethylcellulose is optionally added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A composition of the film-forming agent is useful to apply to hair. The composition aids hair setting and quick drying. It can be combined with pigment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to compositions for enhancing the finish of the cosmetic. An enhancing agent that produces a gloss or shine when contacted to the skin or its appendages is another aspect of the present invention. The enhancing agent also preferably has a moisturizing effect. When used with the lip coloring agent of the present invention, the enhancing agent acts as a base coat and a conditioner. The enhancing agent may be clear or may include a tint. The tinted version offers a variation in lip coloring when used with the lip coloring cosmetic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The enhancing agent used alone will wear off. It does not have to be removed with the remover solution. To prevent the enhancer from wearing off it must be &ldquo;locked&rdquo; in with the liquid lip coloring agent or the colorless film forming composition. These two compositions provide a resin as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A multi-purpose, all weather, protective moisturizing lip balm can be used alone or as a base conditioner when used as a coating for the liquid lip cosmetic of the present invention. The lip balm is waxless. A lip balm is prepared by adding a solidifying agent such as silica to a formulation for an enhancing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Such compositions, when applied over the cosmetic, transform the finish of the cosmetic from a matte to a high-gloss finish. The finish enhancing compositions also keep the lips soft and moist and may be massaged lightly into the lips prior to application of the cosmetic to condition and moisturize the lips. The finish enhancing compositions may be applied with an applicator wand. The user can apply the finish enhancing composition multiple times, whenever it is desired to moisturize the lips or to enhance the finish of the cosmetic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to compositions for removing the cosmetic, finish enhancer, and color enhancers. These compositions may be dabbed on a tissue and applied to the lips when the user desires to remove the preceding compositions from the lips. Preferably, the remover is applied before applying the cosmetic compositions to prepare the surface for optimum adherence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to kits to provide a plurality of the compositions of the present invention and to methods of using them, that is, of applying them to skin and its appendages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Kits are combinations of compositions of the present invention that are packaged and sold as a unit, or advertised as a unit. The unit may either be a single package such as a box or bag, or compartments linked together for purchase, or recommended for purchase in a unit in other ways, for example, by advertising them as a unit or offering a unit price discount. The unifying theme of the present invention is to provide smear-resistant products that stay on the human epidermis longer than previously reported products. The improvement is due to use of a film-forming agent that preferably is a resin that is soluble in an organic solvent such as alcohol, but insoluble in water. Because of the properties of the film-forming agent, a remover specifically designed to remove it and whatever other agents are applied to the skin and its appendages with the film-forming agent is offered either as part of the kit or as a recommended purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the kit, the source of the film-forming agent, the agents used in conjunction with it, and the remover may be in separate compartments. The compartments may be independently structured, for example as separate vials in box, or linked such as components of a single complex such as parts of a tube. Some of the sources, except for the remover, may be combined, for example the film forming agent and the pigment. The remover would not e combined with the other ingredients in the same compartment because the remover, by definition, negates the film forming characteristics of the other components of the kit. The remover may be provided in a foam by means of adding gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Some of the kit components may be provided in a towelette form, e.g. the remover, the enhancing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of a kit include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> 1. a film forming agent </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> a pigment for coloring lips </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> a remover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The cosmetics of the present invention are both smear-proof and waterproof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> They will not streak, smear, or rub off while swimming, smoking, or kissing. Use of the cosmetics of the present invention avoids the disadvantages of stains on coffee cups, cheeks and collars. The cosmetics of the present invention have twice the staying power of analogous cosmetics such as lipsticks or balms which purport to be waterproof or kiss-proof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The cosmetics of the present invention have further advantages in that they won&apos;t stick to dental work or braces. They can be used on hair, such as lashes or eyebrows, as well as to cover any bald areas on the head. It can be used to cover scars or tattoos anywhere on the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a perfect cosmetic for busy professional women. It is highly advantageous for wear at weddings, parties, for use at the beach, for use while skiing and for wear during all active sports. The cosmetic of the invention is extremely attractive and can be worn at important dinner dates, as well as during informal events. The wearer can even sleep or shower while wearing the cosmetic, since it will not fade or smear under such circumstances. The user may apply several layers of the cosmetic to achieve the desired appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> All of the liquid formulations of the cosmetic with film-forming agent of the foregoing examples will dry in a thin film, when applied to the lips. The cosmetic will not crack or cake eve with repeated applications. When any of the foregoing formulations are applied to a wearer&apos;s lips in at least three layers, the cosmetic covering provided will last a wearer engaged in virtually any normal activity throughout an entire day without fading or rubbing off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The formulations disclosed herein may also be used to apply color to skin, nails, hair or to cover bald spots. In addition, the above compositions can be used as liners to provide definition. For use as a liner, darker pigments are preferred, although any pigment will work. Additionally, if used as a liner, the composition should be applied to the lips with a fine tip brush. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic of the invention may also employ vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, drugs, organic compounds, herbs, proteins, plant extracts, root extracts, enzymes, sorbitol, pectin and PCA to take advantage of their known coloring, flavoring, moistening and adhering properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Additional components may be added to the above composition including flavoring agents, skin conditioning agents, emollients, skin protectants, sunscreens, UV high absorbers, anti-oxidants, humectants, essential oils, minerals, PABA, heterocyclic compounds, oils, fats, and fatty acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Representative flavoring agents which may be used in the present compositions include cinnamon, peppermint extract, saccharin, Acesulfame K and other flavoring agents such as those listed in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook 2d. ed., published by the cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association, 1101 17<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>St. N.W., Suite 3000, Washington, D.C. 20036 (1992). The amounts and identities of such flavoring agents may be adjusted to provide a desirable flavor to the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Numerous skin conditioning agents may be selected for use in the present compositions, provided they are oil soluble. These include the emollients, humectants, miscellaneous, and occlusive skin conditioning agents listed in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook. The amounts and identities of such skin conditioning agents can be adjusted to provide the desired results. A highly preferred humectant is glycerin. Many UV absorbing compounds are known to those skilled in the art, including those listed in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook. However, the preferred UV absorber is octylcrylene. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic of the present invention includes a basic cosmetic composition that includes a film-forming agent, preferably prepared in an organic solvent; a lip coloring cosmetic which is the basic cosmetic with pigment; an enhancing agent; a treated enhancing agent; a waxless lip balm with or without tint; hair and skin coloring agents; and removers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The cosmetics of the invention contains no petroleum products. Small amounts of waxes are optional, as needed for pigment dispersions. Waxes can smear while petroleum products can burn or dry the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Lip Coloring Cosmetic </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The basic cosmetic composition of the invention is so sheer that a wearer can layer on at least three different layers without any danger of the product caking up, for example, on the lips. Indeed, the different layers of the cosmetic of the invention can be applied in different colors to achieve a unique, aesthetic effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Also, a different number of layers of the cosmetic can be applied to produce different aesthetic appearances. A single layer basic cosmetic of the invention dries to a shear finish. If a second layer of the cosmetic is applied over the first, a medium matte finish is achieved. By applying a third layer, a wearer achieves a full cover matte finish. Even with use of multiple layers, however, the basic cosmetic of the invention will not cake or smear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The basic cosmetic of the invention can be formulated in any number of different colors by varying the color of the pigment employed. The basic cosmetic of the invention may be applied in a liquid form and the colors can be used individually or mixed by layering to create an unlimited array of custom, personalized colors. Each layer takes about twenty seconds to dry from the time of application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In addition to its basic components, the cosmetic of the invention may include other substances to achieve certain effects. For example, the basic cosmetic may be formulated with at least about one part of a dimethicone component to achieve a gloss or satin effect. Although the cosmetic formulated in this manner looks and feels viscid or sticky, it will not come off, but will stay on the lips despite extended wear and exposure to moisture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The basic cosmetic may also be formulated as a lip liner by utilizing a higher concentration of cosmetic dyes or pigments in the formulation. When formulated in this manner, the cosmetic may be utilized to outline the lips in the same or a different color as the basic application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The basic cosmetic of the invention provides natural sun protection and keeps the lips from chapping, indoors, or outdoors, in both cold and hot weather. It will not stick to teeth or dental braces. Unlike a user wearing lipstick, an individual wearing the cosmetic of the present invention can actually brush and floss after means without smearing the cosmetic or reducing the thickness of its lip coating, and without having to reapply the lip covering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic of the invention is organic and hypoallergenic. Unless a flavor or fragrance is added, it is also odor free and contains no petroleum products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The lip cosmetic of the invention enhances the beauty of the wearer without surgery by filling in the inner lips where conventional lipstick will not stay. The lip cosmetic of the invention is extremely sheer and is not gooey like conventional lipstick. Even after three or more layers of the cosmetic of the invention are applied, the lips still fee bare and have a perfect matte finish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The liquid lip cosmetic of the invention is not at all viscous, and can even be poured from a container. Its sheer consistency allows it to be applied with a fine tip applicator so that it can be applied with the precision of a makeup artist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic of the invention will not come off with petroleum jelly or cleansing cream. Due to its permanence, care must be taken not to spill the cosmetic of the invention in liquid form onto clothing or other fabrics. However, if the cosmetic is accidentally spilled onto carpeting or clothing, it can be readily removed by applying water and then applying isopropyl alcohol or the cosmetic removing formulations described below, provided that cleanup is undertaken promptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> To use the lip cosmetic of the invention, it is recommended that the lip area be cleaned thoroughly with the cosmetic removing compositions described below. A bottle of the cosmetic containing small mixing balls should be shaken for four or five times until the mixing balls move freely within the bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The lip cosmetic of the invention is then applied generously in liquid form to dry, clean lips. It is recommended that three consecutive layers be applied at a time for full day-time coverage. The cosmetic can be applied with a soft doefoot applicator or brush applicator and should be applied across the lips in a single direction only. When applying the cosmetic, the wearer should keep in mind the freedom of creating fuller lips by filing in the inner lips where regular lipstick does not stay. Approximately 20 seconds should be allowed to elapse between consecutive coats in order to allow the immediately preceding coat to dry. During this time, the lips should be kept apart and not blotted. For best results after the application of the cosmetic of the invention, the wearer should refrain from eating, drinking or smoking for at least one minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With the application of the cosmetic, the wearer&apos;s lips may tingle at first. This tingling sensation diminishes or goes away entirely with repeated use, because the sealing effect of the product actually helps to eliminate the mild, but ever present chapping common to most lips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The tingling sensation which is sometimes present may be avoided by applying at first a thin layer of the cosmetic containing dimethicone. Subsequent layers of the same or a different formulation of the cosmetic may be applied to achieve the desired degree of sheer or matte finish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The bottle containing the cosmetic of the invention should be kept closed after each use. With daily use, a one quarter bottle should last approximately two months. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Film-Forming Agents </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> An improvement of the invention is use of at least one film-forming agent present in an amount of at least about one percent wherein the film-forming agent is selected from the group consisting of: AMPHOMER (copolymers of N-tert-octylacrylamide, methyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, acrylic acid and/or t-butyl aminoethylmethacrylate), AMPHOMER LOVOCRYL-47 (an octylacrylamide/acrylate/butylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymer), Carboset, JONCRYL (styrene/acrylate copolymers), QUADAMER (terpolymers of alkyl acrylamide, acrylamide or methacrylamide, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, and acrylic or methacrylic acid), GANTREZ (copolymers of vinyl methyl ether and monoalkyl esters of maleic anhydride), and polyvinyl acetate copolymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Five performance tests were conducted on a variety of resins to determine their suitability for use in the present cosmetics. The suspension test was employed to assess the ability of the test compound to be solubilized in a solution of 4.4% test resin, 3.5% ethyl cellulose, 0.5% castor oil, 0.8% D&amp;C Red &num;7 Calcium Lake pigment, and 90.7% ethyl alcohol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The rub test was deigned to determine the test resin&apos;s ability to be retained on the skin. The composition used for the suspension test was painted on the skin and allowed to dry. Thereafter, the skin was rubbed under cool tap water until the composition began to fall apart. A composition received a score of &ldquo;Good&rdquo; if it was able to withstand five minutes or more of rubbing. A compound received a score of fair or poor if it withstood less than one minute of rubbing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the color test, the color of the resin containing compositions used in the suspension test was applied to the lips and the quality of the color obtained was compared to that produced using a composition lacking the test resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the &ldquo;feel on the lips&rdquo; test, the compositions used in the suspension test the compounds were evaluated to determined whether they produced a tight shrinking feeling, cracked, dried the lips, or caked on the lips. Compounds performing favorably in this test produced none of the preceding effects and were not noticeable to the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the drying time test, the compositions used in the suspension test were applied to the lips and the length of time the composition took to dry was evaluated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Preferentially the compositions take about 20 seconds to dry. </paragraph>

While any of these substances tested in the performance tests could be utilized in the formulation of the cosmetic of the invention, the alcohol soluble, water insoluble resin that serves as the film-forming agent preferably includes an AMPHOMER component. The most highly preferred AMPHOMER is Amphomer LV-71. In the preferred formulation the film-forming agent is preferably comprised of an AMPHOMER and ethyl cellulose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> AMPHOMER is a trademark under which copolymers of N-tert-octylacrylamide, methyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, acrylic acid and t-butyl aminoethyl methacrylate are sold. GANTREZ is a trademark under which copolymers of vinyl ethyl ether and mon-alkyl esters of maleic anhydride are sold by GAF. QUADMER is a trademark under which teropolymers of alkyl acrylamide, acrylamide or methacrylamide, N&equals;vinyl pyrrolidone and acrylic or methacrylic acid are sold by American Cyanamid. The most preferred film-forming agent is the commercially available AMPHOMER sold as LV-71 by National Starch and Chemical Company, Specialty Polymers, having an address of 10 Finderne Avenue, P.O. Box 6500, Bridgewater, N.J. 08007-3300. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The amphoteric acrylic resin forming the chemicals sold in the trade as AMPHOMER has previously been utilized as a fixture in hair spray as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,192 and 4,315,910. However, Applicant has discovered that this substance can also serve as the preferred form of the critical ingredient of a cosmetic which forms a clear, colorless film on the lops and which has a staying power far greater than that of conventional lipsticks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The AMPHOMER utilized in the cosmetic of the invention functions as a transparent sealer. It binds and seals the cosmetic to the lips in a clear, sheer film which does not crack or cake. The film-forming agent in the cosmetic composition is what makes the product so long lasting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The AMPHOMER is an amphoteric acrylic resin. Its official Cosmetic Toiletries and Fragrances Association (CTFA) product designation is Octylacrylamide/Acrylates/Butylaminoethyl Methacrylate Copolymer. AMPHOMER is carboxylated at regular intervals along its molecular chain. In its undissolved form it is a fine white free-flowing powder. It has an intrinsic viscosity of 0.40 in ethanol at 25 degrees Centigrade. It contains about three percent volatiles and has an acidity of 2.05 me/gram. </paragraph>

If used, the ethylcellulose is preferably in between about 1 and about 10 parts. In an embodiment, the cosmetic pigment is present in between about 2 and about 10 parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The AMPHOMER utilized in the cosmetic of the invention functions as a transparent sealer. It binds and seals the cosmetic to the lips in a clear, sheer film which does not crack or cake. The film-forming agent in the cosmetic composition is what makes the cosmetics long lasting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Organic Solvent </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The organic solvent or carrier employed is preferably denatured alcohol, sometimes termed ethyl alcohol or ethanol. Other organic solvents which may be employed instead of or in addition to denatured alcohol include stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, cetearyl-cetostearyl alcohol, SDA alcohol, methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and C18-40 alcohol. Other organic solvents which may be employed include higher fatty-acids which are immiscible in water. These include lauric acid, myristic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, behenic acid, and lanolin fatty acid. Lanolin and triterpene may also be employed in the organic solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Depending upon the concentration of the other components, the organic solvent, which is preferably SDA 40B 190 denatured alcohol, is preferably present to the extent of between about 30 to 95 percent. Within this range, a concentration of 80 to 95 percent organic solvent may be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Pigments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The pigments which are employed to provide coloring to the cosmetics are normally provided as dispersions in castor oil. The degree of concentration of the pigments in castor oil determines the shade of the coloring. Normally a concentration of between 25-65 percent pigments in castor oil acts like a plasticizer and also makes the film formed more flexible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The pigment and castor oil are preferably present in the cosmetic of the invention in an aggregate amount of between about 0.1 percent and about ten percent. Alternatively, the pigments may be alcohol soluble pigments, such as D&amp;C Red 28 Lake, in which case a castor oil dispersion is not necessary to solublize the pigments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Pigments of this type are standardized in the cosmetic industry and are identified in that industry by FD&amp;C designations, D&amp;C designations, and natural color designations that are compatible with alcohol solutions. The preferred pigments that are employed include D&amp;C Red No. 6, Barium Lake, D&amp;C Red No. 7, Calcium Lake, D&amp;C Orange No. 5, D&amp;C Red No. 27, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1, iron oxide and others. The D&amp;C lake colors are all made with iron, aluminum, calcium, barium, potassium, strontium or zirconium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Other pigments which may be employed include those of dye or coal tar origin and chemical compounds used as pigments. Inorganic colors such as iron oxides may be utilized. White pigments may be formed of titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, mica or pearls. Pigments formed of nitro dyes may be utilized if desired. These dyes contain one atom of nitrogen and two of oxygen. However, only a few nitro dyes are certified by the FD&amp;C or D&amp;C because nitro dyes can be absorbed through the skin and some are toxic. However, D&amp;C Yellow No. 5 is one acceptable nitro dye which can be used as a component of the pigment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Azo pigments may also be utilized. These pigments are characterized by the presence of the azo bond, and monoazo pigments include the greatest number of pigments within this group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Another group of suitable pigments is the triphenylmethane group. FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 is the most popular dye of the group and is widely used in the cosmetic industry. Xanthene pigments may also be utilized. This group of pigments includes Berry brilliant which is widely used in lipstick colors, as well as D&amp;C orange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Certain of the quinoline dyes are also suitable for use as pigments. There are only two certified cosmetic colors in this category, namely D&amp;C Yellow Nos. 10 and 11. These are bright greenish yellow colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The anthraquinone dyes are also suitable for use in formulating the pigment required by the compositions of the invention. These dyes are widely used in cosmetics because they are not affected by light. D&amp;C Violet No. 2 is one example of such a dye suitable for use in the invention. The anthraquinone dyes should not be used in the lip area, but may be used in other applications, such as on the nails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Indigo dyes are also suitable for use and have been used in cosmetics for may years. D&amp;C Blue No. 6 is one example of a suitable indigo dye. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The present invention also contemplates compositions for enhancing the finish of the cosmetic. An enhancing agent that produces a gloss or shine when contacted the skin and its appendages is another aspect of the present invention. The enhancing agent also has a moisturizing effect. When used with the lip coloring agent of the present invention, the enhancing agent acts as a base coat and a conditioner. The enhancing agent in combination may be clear or may include a tint. The tinted version offers a variation in lip coloring when used with the lip coloring cosmetic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The enhancing agent used alone will wear off. It does not have to be removed with the remover solution. To prevent the enhancer from wearing off it must be &ldquo;locked&rdquo; in with the liquid lip coloring agent or the film forming composition. These two compositions provide a resin as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The finish enhancing agent can be applied over the basic cosmetic to enhance the matte finish of the cosmetic alone into a high-gloss finish. In addition, the lips remain soft and silky while leaving the waterproof and smearproof cosmetic in place. The finish enhancing compositions may also be massaged lightly into the lips prior to application of the cosmetic to condition and moisturizing the lips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The finish enhancing composition may include a silicone. The silicone may be a silicone copolymer. In one version of this composition, the composition comprises about 100% silicone. The silicones function to provide a water barrier, gloss and spreading and wetting activity. They may also include moisturizing abilities and may function as a carrier for other active ingredients such as sunscreens or vitamins. Mixtures of different silicones may also be used to achieve the desired moisturizing, carrier, or other beneficial effects. Virtually any of the silicones offered by GE Silicones will work in the present invention, including Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, mixtures of the Cyclomethicone and Dimethicone, Dimethicone and Laureth-4 and Laureth-23, Dimethicone Copolyol, Cyclomethicone and Dimethicone Copolyol, Trimethylsilylamodimethicone, and other silicones provided by GE Silicones for use in personal products.

<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Example 1: Preparation of a Film-Forming Composition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The first step in formulating a film-forming composition (basic) of the invention is to create a sealer. The sealer is formed by mixing a film-forming agent in an organic solvent. Specifically, suitable film-forming agents include 4.4 parts of Amphomer LV-71, obtained from National Starch and Chemical Company, and 1.9 parts Etocel -22, obtained form Aqualon Corporation, are mixed at room temperature in 93.7 parts 190-proof specially denatured alcohol, sold as SDA 38B-190. The Ethocel -22 provides ethyl cellulose which functions as an adjacent film former in the sealer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Example 2: A Colored Film-Forming Composition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> A. A sealer is first prepared by mixing, for example, 4.3 parts by weight of Amphomer LV-71 along with 3.2 parts by weight Ethocel N-4 into 92.5 parts specially denatured alcohol SDA 40-B-190. 8.25 parts of D&amp;C Red No. 7 pigment dispersion in castor oil along with 0.25 parts D&amp;C Orange No. 5 pigment dispersion in castor oil along with 0.25 parts D&amp;C Orange No. 5 pigment dispersion in castor oil are then mixed with an additional 0.5 parts castor oil and introduced into the quantity of sealer previously prepared. The sealer, therefore, constitutes 90.75 parts by weight of the total composition. The pigment grinds and additional castor oil are stirred into the sealer to produce the finished liquid cosmetic composition according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Five parts by weight of a dispersion of D&amp;C Red No. 7 Calcium Lake in castor oil and 0.5 parts by weight of a dispersion of D&amp;C Orange No. 5 in castor oil are then selected for use as the pigment or coloring agent. Both the D&amp;C Red No. 7 Calcium Lake and the D&amp;C Orange No. 5 each comprise about 50 percent of the total weight of their respective dispersions. The remaining weight of the dispersions is attributable to the castor oil. The pigments should be obtained in as finely ground a form as possible. The pigment dispersions are mixed together along with another 0.5 parts by weight castor oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The pigment and castor oil mixture is then mixed in with the sealer, also at room temperature. The AMPHOMER, the Ethocel and the pigment ingredients are all readily soluble in the denatured alcohol. When mixed, the formulation forms a somewhat turbid solution. Pigment grinds can be stirred into the sealer in any convenient manner. The resultant liquid mixture is one preferred embodiment of a film-forming cosmetic according to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> B. The organic solvent can be from 45% to 98% the Amphomer can be from 0.01-15% other additives can be added such as up to (10% water), the denatured 190 proof ethyl alcohol has 3% water in it with a 7% denaturant of Rosemary oil. Other additives can be Shellac (de waxed bleached), oils and triglycerides, silicones, cellulose, silica, thickeners etc, vitamins, minerals, fragrance, etc. The additives can be used to reduce the alcohol as well as provide a smell or a texture or to create a more pliable feel. Increasing the alcohol can quick dry faster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Example 3: A Film-Forming Composition With a Gloss </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The formulation of Example 1 is repeated, but with the addition of two parts methyl silicone to the sealer prior to adding the pigments to the sealer. The use of a dimethicone such as methyl silicone increases the shininess of the cosmetic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Example 4: A Moisturizing Film-Forming Composition (Gloss) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The formulation of Example 1 is repeated, but with the addition of two parts by weight of glycerin as a humectant in producing the sealer. The use of a humectant aids in moisturizing the lips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Example 5: A Formulation for Applying Color Around the Eyes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, with slight modifications, the above formulations may be used to apply color around the eyes. For application around the eyes, an aqueous solvent is used, the ethylcellulose is omitted, and Aminonathyl amino methyl propanol is added. A suitable composition for use around the eyes comprises between about 0.1 and about 20 parts of a water soluble resin, between about 0.1 and about 15 parts of a cosmetic pigment, between about 0.5 and about 4 parts Aminonathyl amino methyl propanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Preferred finish enhancing compositions are listed in Examples 6-10. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Example 20: A Waxless Lip Balm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> A waxless lip balm formulation is to add about 4-8% (preferred 5%) of a thickening agent such as silica (300 grams) to 4000 grams of an enhancing agent as disclosed herein. Silica functions as an ant caking agent, bulking agent, opacifying agent and suspending agent, any chemical that can provide any of the aforementioned functions will work. An enhancing agent formulation may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Example 21: A Tinted Waxless Lip Balm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> A tinted waxless lip balm formulation is to add pigment (about 0.01-25%) and a thickening agent such as silica (about 0.01-25%) to a formulation for an enhancing agent disclosed herein. For example, take 4000 grams of enhancing agent and add 280 grams of silica and 100 grams of pigment. Color can be created not just by adding pigment, but by using additives of natural extracts, for example, pomegranate, aloe leaves, and grape seeds. Regardless of additives, the silica level should remain about the same. Sunscreen can also be added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Example 22: Use of Capsules </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The capsules can be added to colored or clear formulations. The capsules can be purchased separately, they can also be injected with a dropper or syringe or through a cartage system such as a pen cartage. (one cartage of clear formula piercing the other cartage with the desired color or vitamin or whatever is desired in it in a pen device that mixes the two and flows through the pen). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Undoubtedly, numerous variations and modifications of the invention will become readily apparent to those familiar with cosmetic products. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should not be construed as limited to the specific examples described, because those examples are presented herein only as being illustrative of the many formulations possible according to the invention.
