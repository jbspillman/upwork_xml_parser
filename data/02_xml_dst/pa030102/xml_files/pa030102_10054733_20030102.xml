<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for performing a plurality of work operations in parallel using a plurality of work devices within one workstation. More specifically, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for dispensing material onto a substrate using one or more dispensing heads in a dispensing system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There are several types of prior art dispensing systems used for dispensing metered amounts of liquid or paste for a variety of applications. One such application is in the assembly of printed circuit boards and integrated circuit chips. In this application, dispensing systems are used in the process of encapsulating integrated circuits with an encapsulating material and in the process of underfilling flip integrated circuit chips with an encapsulent. Prior art dispensing systems are also used for dispensing dots or balls of liquid epoxy or solder paste onto circuit boards and integrated circuits. The liquid epoxy and solder are used to secure components or connect components, respectively, to a circuit board or to an integrated circuit. The dispensing systems described above include those manufactured and distributed by Speedline Technologies, Inc, the assignee of the present invention, under the name CAMALOT&trade;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The dispensing systems described above are typically used in an electronics manufacturing facility in an automated assembly line with other equipment used in a circuit board or integrated circuit manufacturing process. The other equipment in-line with the dispensing systems may include, for example, pick and place machines, which place components on circuit boards, or reflow ovens that are used to heat materials, such as solder paste, dispensed onto the circuit boards or integrated circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a typical dispensing system, a pump and dispenser assembly is mounted to a moving assembly for moving the pump and dispenser assembly along three mutually orthogonal axes (x, y, z) using servomotors controlled by a computer system or controller. To dispense a dot of liquid on a circuit board at a desired location, the pump and dispenser assembly is moved along the horizontal x and y axes until it is located over the desired location. The pump and dispenser assembly is then lowered along the vertical z axis until the nozzle of the pump and dispenser assembly is at an appropriate dispensing height over the board. The pump and dispenser assembly dispenses a dot of liquid, is then raised along the z axis, moved along the x and y axes to a new location, and is lowered along the z axis to dispense the next liquid dot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> During the manufacture of circuit boards, it is sometimes necessary, or desirable, to dispense two different liquids or pastes onto a circuit board or to dispense different volumes of the same material. Dispensing systems have been designed that can dispense one of a number of dispensing materials from one dispensing head. One example of such a dispensing system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/519,146, filed Aug. 24, 1995, which is incorporated herein by reference. These dispensing systems typically are only able to dispense one material at a time, and the throughput of product in these systems may be less than desired because of the time required to dispense multiple materials serially using one dispensing head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To overcome the throughput problem, two dispensing systems may be placed adjacent to each other with the first dispensing system dispensing one material and the second dispensing system dispensing a second material. This solution is expensive since two complete machines are used, and since additional manufacturing space is required. In typical operations, manufacturing floor space is limited, and it is desirable to limit the &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; of each manufacturing system on the manufacturing floor. </paragraph>
</section>

The dispensing unit <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is aligned with the motor unit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, mated with the motor unit and locked in place using locking plate <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. When the dispensing unit mates with the motor unit, the pin probe assembly <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> of the motor unit makes electrical contact with the circuit board <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the dispensing unit. In one embodiment, the dispensing head is able to detect the type of dispensing unit mated with it based on the resistance detected across contact pads on the circuit board. In this embodiment, different jumpers may be provided on the circuit board to identify dispensing unit characteristics such as the type of cartridge loaded into the dispensing unit and the type of material loaded into the dispensing cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the circuit board includes a non-volatile data storage device such as a programmable read only memory. In this embodiment, the storage device may include additional characteristics of the dispensing unit including calibration data of the dispensing cartridge, remaining shelf life of the material in the dispensing cartridge, run-time of the dispensing unit and the size of the dispensing needle mounted to the cartridge. In some embodiments, data stored in the data storage device may be updated by the dispensing head. The calibration data stored in the storage device may include data regarding the position of the outlet of the dispensing needle. Because a kinematic mount is provided between the motor unit and the dispensing unit, this position data may be used to properly position the dispensing head for dispensing on a substrate. In some embodiments, the dispensing unit may be calibrated off line, not connected to the motor unit, and the calibration data may be stored in the storage device. Once the dispensing unit is mounted to the motor unit, little or no additional calibration may be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When the dispensing unit is mated with the motor unit, the elongated gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of the motor unit couples with the gear <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the dispensing unit, the lift plate <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> couples with the shoulder <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the dispensing cartridge and the output pneumatic port <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> mates with the pneumatic inlet port <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> To dispense material onto a substrate, the dispensing head <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is first moved by the gantry system of the dispensing system to position the needle above the substrate. The touch probe assembly <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may then be used to determine the distance between the dispensing head and the substrate. The dispensing cartridge <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is then lowered toward the substrate by activating the Z-axis motor <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to cause the lift plate <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> to be lowered. When the dispensing cartridge is lowered, the inlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the lower cartridge <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> causes the syringe slide plate <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, the syringe adapter plate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the syringe to be lowered towards the substrate. In one embodiment of the present invention, the lower cartridge may include a spring-loaded stop that extends beyond the needle. The spring-loaded stop contacts the substrate to prevent further downward movement of the needle to accurately set the dispensing height of the needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Once the needle is at the proper dispensing height, the Z-drive motor is activated to cause the elongated gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and the gear <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to turn, thereby causing material to be dispensed. The use of the elongated gear allows the dispensing cartridge to be lowered while maintaining coupling between the elongated gear <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and the gear <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, preferably used for dispensing multiple dots of material, after one dot is dispensed at a first dispensing position, the lift plate is raised a relatively small amount causing the dispensing cartridge to be raised a small amount. The dispensing head is then moved to position the needle over a second dispensing position. When the dispensing cartridge is raised, the outlet <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> moves within the slot <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> of the slider plate <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. By keeping the distance that the dispensing cartridge is raised less than the length of the slot <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight>, the dispensing cartridge can be lifted without lifting the syringe. It is generally desirable to lift the needle when moving the dispensing head between dot dispensing positions to prevent the needle from contacting components or other protrusions on the substrate. In the embodiment of the present invention described above, the needle can be raised without raising the syringe providing less stress on the Z-axis motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, preferably used for larger volumes of material, for example, lines of material, the syringe is fixed in place to the dispensing cartridge using a rigid metal tube in place of the hose <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, and the slider plate is not used. When the lifting plate lowers the dispensing cartridge, the syringe moves with the dispensing cartridge. The use of the rigid tube prevents changes in back pressure that may occur when a flexible hose is used. In addition, for some dispensing materials, it is desirable to heat the material prior to dispensing. For these materials, the metal tube may be heated to raise the temperature of the dispensing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments of the present invention, for either the dot dispensing embodiment or the line dispensing embodiment discussed above, further vertical movement of the needle may be provided by moving the entire dispensing head <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> vertically using motors mounted to the gantry system of the dispensing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the dispensing cartridges used with embodiments of the present invention may include auger style pumps, and in some embodiments, the auger style pumps may include a shut off valve such as one of those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,819,983. When a shut-off valve is used, an additional pneumatic connection may be provided between the motor unit and the dispensing unit to control the shut-off valve. In some embodiments of the present invention, when a fairly abrasive material, such as solder paste, is used in the dispensing unit, the shut-off valve may be controlled such that it does not completely close to prevent damage to the valve and the valve seat by solid particles contained in the dispensing material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For some dispensing applications, it is desirable to maintain the material to be dispensed at an elevated temperature. To accommodate these applications, in some embodiments of the present invention, electrical heaters, such as those available from Merrimac of Haverhill, Mass. having part no. MTWA-250-1.25, are incorporated in the lower housing <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the dispensing unit. In these embodiments, temperature sensors may also be incorporated in the lower housing to monitor the temperature of the material. Electrical connections for the heaters and the temperature sensors may be provided through the pin probe assembly <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> and circuit board <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. In addition, to aid in the heating of the material, air may be passed over the heaters in the lower block housing. The air may be provided through an additional pneumatic connection between the motor unit and the dispensing unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of a dispensing head <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, having dual dispensing cartridges will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. The dispensing head <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is similar to dispensing head <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with the exception that an additional dispensing cartridge and supporting components have been added. Common elements of the dispensing head <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the dispensing head <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are labeled using the same reference numbers. The dispensing head <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> includes a motor unit <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and a dispensing unit <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. The dispensing unit <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> includes, in addition to the components of the dispensing unit <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, a second dispensing cartridge <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, and a second syringe support <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> for supporting a second syringe <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>. The dispensing unit also includes a second pneumatic input port <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> to receive pressurized air for pressurizing the material in the second syringe <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The motor unit <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> includes, in addition to the components of the motor unit <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, an additional Z-axis motor, an additional motor drive assembly <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> having a second elongated gear <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>, an electromagnetic clutching device (not shown) for selectively engaging the dispense motor <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to one of the two motor drive assemblies, and a second lift plate <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The dispensing head <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> operates in substantially the same manner as the dispensing head <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> discussed above, except that in dispensing head <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> dispensing may occur from either of the dispensing cartridges independently. In typical applications, the dispensing cartridges will be either of different types or contain different materials to provide additional flexibility to dispensing operations, and one of the two dispensing cartridges will be selected to perform a particular dispensing operation. For example, one of the dispensing cartridges may be a dot dispensing cartridge optimized to dispense dots, while the other cartridge may be a line dispensing cartridge optimized to dispense lines of material. Preferably, a dispensing cartridge not in use will be maintained in a raised position to prevent it from contacting any components mounted on the substrate. As understood by those skilled in the art, to accommodate special dispensing operations, in some embodiments, the two dispensing cartridges in the dispensing head <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> may be designed to be operated simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of dispensing heads discussed above, either one or two dispensing cartridges are contained in a dispensing unit. In other embodiments, to accommodate other applications, more than two dispensing cartridges could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments of the present invention discussed above, the dispensing units are mated with the motor unit manually. In other embodiments which will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> dispensing system may automatically exchange dispensing units. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a top view of a four head dispensing system <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that is similar to the dispensing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The dispensing system <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> includes four gantry systems <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, each having a dispensing head <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>implemented using one of the two-part dispensing heads of the present invention described herein. Attached to the front vertical supports <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight> of one of the gantry systems <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, are dispensing unit holders <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that may contain a number of dispensing units. As understood by those skilled in the art, although dispensing unit holders are shown for only gantry system <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, additional dispensing unit holders could be provided for each of the other gantry systems <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The dispensing system <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> automatically replaces a dispensing unit of dispensing head <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as follows. The gantry system <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>positions the dispensing head at the dispensing holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The dispensing head is then placed in an empty slot in the holder. The dispensing unit holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may include a release mechanism that captures the locking plate to release the dispensing unit being replaced. Once the dispensing unit has been removed, the dispensing head is positioned at dispensing unit holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to mate with a new dispensing unit contained therein. Dispensing unit holder <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may include a locking mechanism that captures the locking plate to lock the new dispensing unit in place. The dispensing head may then be positioned over substrates to dispense material from the new dispensing unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of dispensing systems of the present invention having dispensing unit holders, the dispensing units may be calibrated prior to being placed in the dispensing unit holder. The calibration data may then be stored in a data storage device in the dispensing unit. When the dispensing unit is mated with the motor unit, the calibration data can be read from the storage device, thereby obviating the need to perform a calibration routine each time a dispensing unit is replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Dispensing heads in accordance with the present invention have been described as being used with the multiple dispensing head dispensing system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As understood by those skilled in the art, the dispensing heads of the present invention may also be used with other dispensing systems having one dispensing head or more than one dispensing head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In dispensing units of embodiments of the present invention discussed above, gears are used to couple motors of the motor unit to dispensing cartridges of the dispensing units. In other embodiments, other mechanisms such as belts, drive shafts or other device can be used to couple the motors to the dispensing cartridges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of dispensing heads discussed above, the use of replaceable dispensing units greatly expands the flexibility of a dispensing system, by allowing dispensing units to be replaced without replacing an entire dispensing head. Further, since the dispensing units do not include motors, it is economical to maintain a large number of spare dispensing units having different characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Having thus described at least one illustrative embodiment of the invention, various alterations, modifications and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications and improvements are intended to be within the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is by way of example only and is not intended as limiting.</paragraph>
