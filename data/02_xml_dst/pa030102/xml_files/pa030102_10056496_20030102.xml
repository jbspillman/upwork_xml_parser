<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the field of disc drive data storage devices and more particularly, but without limitation, to performing real-time, closed loop write verification by detecting electromagnetic coupling of constituent components making up the write path in the disc drive. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Modem data storage devices such as disc drives are commonly used in a multitude of computer environments to store large amounts of data in a form that is readily available to a user. Generally, a disc drive has a magnetic disc, or two or more stacked magnetic discs, that are rotated by a motor at high speeds. Each disc has a data storage surface divided into a series of generally concentric data tracks where data is stored in the form of magnetic flux transitions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A data transfer member (sometimes referred to as a read/write head) such as a magnetic transducer is moved by an actuator to selected positions adjacent the data storage surface to sense the magnetic flux transitions in reading data from the disc, and to transmit electrical signals to induce the magnetic flux transitions in writing data to the disc. The active elements of the data transfer member are supported by suspension structures extending from the actuator. The active elements are maintained a small distance above the data storage surface as the data transfer member flies upon an air bearing generated by air currents caused by the spinning discs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Each read/write head is typically provided with separate read and write elements, with a common configuration utilizing a thin film, inductive write element and a magneto-resistive (MR) read element. Data are written by passing a write current through the write element, with the write current generating a time-varying electromagnetic field which accordingly magnetizes the disc surface. Previously written data are read using the read element to transduce the selective magnetization of the disc to generate a read signal which is received by a read channel to reconstruct the data. An interface circuit buffers and controls the transfer of data between the disc and a host computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Technological advancements in the art have resulted in continued improvements in disc drive data storage capacities and transfer rates, as well as the reliability with which the data is stored and recalled. Design cycle times are continually being accelerated as well, with each new generation typically providing a doubling in storage capacity. These fast-paced advancements have driven the need for improved methodologies that ensure that data is consistently and accurately stored and retrieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One such methodology to ensure data integrity involves the grouping of a plurality of disc drives into a multi-drive array, sometimes referred to as a RAID (&ldquo;Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs&rdquo;). Since their introduction, RAIDs have found widespread use in a variety of applications requiring significant levels of data transfer, capacity and integrity performance. One such RAID architecture employs mirroring, where data is simultaneously written to two or more disc drives. Another approach employs striping, where portions of data streams are written to different disc drives. Yet another approach employs interleaving wherein various types of error detection and correction schemes are carried out at multiple levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another popular methodology useful in ensuring data integrity is write verification, which involves the writing of data to a disc followed by a subsequent read operation where the previously stored data are retrieved from the disc to ensure the data were correctly written. However, such write verification operations undesirably decrease the data transfer performance of the disc drive, as each write operation requires each sector to which data are written to be accessed at least twice: first, when the data are written, and second, when the data are subsequently read back for verification. Conventional write verification techniques accordingly impose a severe penalty on disc drive performance, limiting data transfer rates to levels substantially below that which would be otherwise achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another methodology involves real-time monitoring of the write head during a write operation. Writing failures can stem from a defective write element; that is, a write element that is electrically open or shorted. During data writing operations there exists an observable expected amount of electromagnetic coupling within the constituent parts of the electrical read/write path. It has been determined that an optimal solution for ensuring a write-safe condition of the write element lies in simultaneously verifying the expected electromagnetic coupling effects while writing data. It is to these improvements and others as exemplified by the description and appended claims that embodiments of the present invention are directed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention contemplate a disc drive comprising a rotatable disc having a magnetic recording surface, and a data reading and writing assembly. The data reading and writing assembly comprises a read/write head comprising a write element and a read element, both adjacent the recording surface; a preamplifier comprising a write driver applying a series of write currents for writing data to the recording surface and a read amplifier for reading stored data from the recording surface; and an interconnect joining the write driver to the write element so as to generate time-varying electromagnetic fields selectively magnetizing the recording surface in response to the write currents, and joining the read amplifier to the read element so as to transduce magnetization vectors on the recording surface associated with stored data. The disc drive furthermore comprises a detection circuit connected to the data reading and writing assembly, receiving a write-safe signal indicative of a write-safe condition, the write-safe signal comprising a sum of constituent operable electromagnetic coupling values of the read/write head, the preamplifier and the interconnect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the detection circuit is connected to the preamplifier and receives the write-safe signal when a bias current is directed to the read element while writing data to the recording surface, such that a reversal in the writing current generates an electromagnetic coupling effect in the bias current. An advantageous construction comprises adaptively connecting the circuit to the analog buffer head voltage terminal of the preamplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention further contemplate a method for writing data in a data storage device, comprising: (a) generating a write current signal associated with the data to be written with a write driver portion of a preamplifier; (b) transmitting the write current signal along an interconnect to a magneto resistive write element portion of a read/write head to generate a time-varying electromagnetic field imparting flux transitions associated with the data in a data storage portion of the data storage device; (c) supplying a bias current to a read portion of the read/write head; (d) while transmitting the write current, simultaneously reading an electromagnetic coupling signal comprising constituent coupling signals of the preamplifier, the interconnect and the read/write head; and (e) comparing the electromagnetic coupling signal to a threshold value indicative of a write-safe condition of the write element. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings in general, and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, shown therein is a plan view of a disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a head-disc assembly (HDA) <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a disc drive printed wiring assembly (PWA) which is mounted to the underside of the HDA <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and thus, not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As discussed below, the PWA provides circuitry necessary to control the operation of the HDA <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and to transfer data between the HDA <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a host computer in which the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be mounted in a user environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The HDA <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes a base deck <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to which various disc drive components are mounted. A top cover, which has been omitted from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to facilitate the present discussion, cooperates with the base deck <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to form an internal, sealed environment for the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A spindle motor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is provided to rotate a stack of discs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at a constant high speed, with a disc clamp <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> securing the discs to the spindle motor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> To access the discs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a controllably positionable actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided which rotates about a cartridge bearing assembly <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in response to currents applied to a coil (a portion of which is shown at <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>) of a voice coil motor (VCM) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of arms from which corresponding flexure assemblies extend, the topmost of which are identified at <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, respectively. Heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are provided at distal ends of the flexure assemblies <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and are supported over the discs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by air bearings established by air currents set up by the rotation of the discs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A latch assembly <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is provided to secure the heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> over landing zones, such as at the innermost diameters of the discs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> when the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is deactivated. A flex circuit assembly <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> provides electrical communication paths between the actuator assembly <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the disc drive PWA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, each of the heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a thin-film inductive write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and a magnetoresistive (MR) read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> writes data to the corresponding disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by generating a time varying electromagnetic field (indicated generally at <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>) across a gap <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in response to write currents applied to the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The electromagnetic field <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> operates to selectively magnetize the disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> along a direction of movement of the disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). Magnetic flux transitions result at locations where reversals in the magnetization of the disc occur, such as shown at <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, preferably disposed in the write gap <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> of the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, is characterized as providing a changed electrical resistance in the presence of an electromagnetic field of selected orientation. Hence, by passing a bias current through the read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, previously stored data can be transduced from the magnetized disc surface and converted to a readback signal in relation to changes in the voltage across the read element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a generalized functional block diagram of the control electronics arranged on the disc drive PWA in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention. One of the heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is illustrated, with corresponding write and read elements <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. A preamplifier circuit <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> includes a write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and a read amplifier <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. The write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> applies write currents to the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the read amplifier <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> applies a read bias current to the read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. A communication channel <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is operably connected to the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, and includes a write channel <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> which encodes and serializes input user data for writing by the write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>, and a read channel <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> which receives readback signals from the read amplifier <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> and reconstructs previously stored user data therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Servo data from the disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is passed from the read channel <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to a servo circuit <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, which includes a programmable digital signal processor (DSP) <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> to carry out head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> positioning operations. An interface circuit <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> has a buffer <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> to temporarily store data during data transfer operations between the discs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a host computer. Transfers between the buffer <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and discs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are controlled by a disc interface <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>, and transfers between the buffer <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the host computer are controlled by a host interface <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. A processor interface <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> enables communication between the interface circuit <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> and a system processor <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, which controls overall operation of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Summarizing, for clarity sake, the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be said to comprise a data reading and writing assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprising three constituent parts&mdash;the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, and an electrical interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> electrically connecting the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The read/write head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, both adjacent the recording surface of the data storage disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> comprises the write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> applying a series of write currents for writing data to the recording surface and the read amplifier <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> for reading stored data from the recording surface. The interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> joins the write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> so as to generate time-varying electromagnetic fields selectively magnetizing the recording surface in response to the write currents. The interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> also joins the read amplifier <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> to the read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> so as to transduce magnetization vectors on the recording surface associated with stored data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> If the read amplifier <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is activated to generate the bias current during the time that the write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is activated to send a write current to the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, then the reversal in the writing current <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) generates an electromagnetic coupling effect in the bias current. In operable conditions, the electromagnetic coupling occurs in all three constituent parts of the data reading and writing assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at various magnitudes based on the characteristic construction of the parts. That is, if the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has a properly wound and connected transducer coil, then an expected electromagnetic coupling effect <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> will occur between the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Likewise, if the circuits are properly connected in the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> then an expected electromagnetic coupling effect <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will occur between the write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and the read amplifier <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. Likewise, if the circuits, such as in a flex on suspension (FOS), are properly constructed and connected, then an expected electromagnetic coupling effect <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will occur between the respective leads <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Summing the constituent coupling effects <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can provide a write-safe signal indicative of a data reading and writing assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that is operative. That is, by comparing the write-safe signal to a predetermined threshold value then defective and marginal components can be screened. For example, if the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is either electrically shorted or electrically open then no constituent coupling effect <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> will be produced, thereby decreasing the value of the write-safe signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> diagrammatically illustrates the data reading and writing assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> illustrating one manner of detecting the write-safe signal. In a preferred embodiment a detection circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is connected to the analog buffer head voltage (ABHV) terminal <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. In this manner the detection circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can provide on-board continuous monitoring of the write-safe signal, and communicate with the system processor <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> to compare the value of the write-safe signal to a saved threshold value in order to control the operations of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> accordingly. In a preferred embodiment the minimum expected write-safe signal level is determined and a threshold value is preselected and saved such that an observed write-safe value less than the threshold value indicates an inoperative data reading and writing assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the coupling effect induces voltage transitions in the bias current that are detectable by the detection circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> graphically illustrates this screening process by the detection circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. A write signal, such as a <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>T signal, curve <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the write-safe signal <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are each plotted against a common x-axis representing elapsed time and a common y-axis representing respective signal amplitudes. The write current signal <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> generally represents pulsed write currents that are applied by the write over <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to selectively magnetize the disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Transitions in the write current polarity <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> generate corresponding flux transitions <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) on the disc surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The coupling electromagnetic signal, or write-safe signal, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> generally represents the sum of the constituent coupling effects of the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The write-safe signal <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> has positive and negative peaks <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> associated with the magnitude of the coupling effects. A predetermined threshold value <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is saved and compared to the amplitude of the peaks, such as with a peak detect method, to determine a write-safe signal <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> indicative of a properly operating data reading and writing assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. If, for example, the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is inoperative, such as because of an electrical short-circuit or an electrical open-circuit, then the amplitude <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> will be correspondingly reduced. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates this case where the amplitude <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is less than the threshold value <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the threshold value <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is selected so as to indicate an inoperative or marginal condition of the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine the value of the constituent coupling effect contributed only by the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the write-safe signal. First, the contribution made by the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> can be determined by short-circuiting the output terminals <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) and disconnecting the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> from the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. In an experimental trial it was determined that the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> accounted for 34% of the total write-safe signal, such that the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> accounted for the balance of 66% of the total write-safe signal. Thereafter, the output terminals <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> from the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> can be unshorted and the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> reconnected. Then the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is electrically disconnected from the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In a continuation of the experimental trial it was determined that the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contribution was 55% and the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> contribution was 11%, respectively, of the total write-safe signal. Accordingly, the threshold value (V<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>) can be set nominally at 55% of the total observed write-safe signal value to screen for inoperative heads <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention contemplate a method for writing data in a data storage device by the apparatus described hereinabove. The method comprises: generating the write current signal <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> associated with the data to be written with the write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> portion of the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>; transmitting the write current signal <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> along the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the magnetoresistive write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> portion of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to generate the time-varying electromagnetic field <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> imparting flux transitions <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> associated with the data in the data storage portion of the data storage device; supplying the bias current to the read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> portion of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>; while transmitting the write current, simultaneously reading the electromagnetic coupling signal <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> comprising constituent coupling signals of the preamplifier <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the interconnect <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the head <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>; and comparing the electromagnetic coupling signal <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> to the threshold value <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> indicative of the write-safe condition of the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the embodiments contemplate a method wherein the reading step is accomplished by connecting a detection circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to the analog buffer head voltage terminal <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a minimum or threshold expected electromagnetic coupling signal can be determined such that a write-safe condition is indicated when the observed write-safe signal is greater than the threshold value. The constituent coupling signal of the preamplifier <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> can be determined by short-circuiting the output terminals <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and disconnecting the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> while generating the write current signal <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The constituent coupling signal of the interconnect <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can be determined by subsequently unshorting the output terminals <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, reconnecting the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and removing the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be removed by either short-circuiting the input terminals of the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or by disconnecting the input lead of the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> provides a flow chart for a WRITE VERIFICATION routine <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, illustrative of steps carried out by the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment to perform closed-loop write verification of data written to the discs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. With reference to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</cross-reference>, during a write operation, the first set of data to be written is selected, as shown by step <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. While the amount of data in the first set of data can vary depending on the application, preferably the first set of data represents an amount that can be accommodated by the user data field of a selected data block, such as 512 kilobytes (kB). Of course, a large user file is typically broken down and written to a number of data blocks, with the file being transferred to the buffer <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and incrementally outputted to the write channel <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The write channel <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> operates to encode and serialize the data to enable the write driver <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> in block <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. This operation includes run-length limited (RLL) and error correction code (ECC) encoding, to facilitate subsequent retrieval of the recorded data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The write currents generated at block <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> are applied to the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in block <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> to generate the time-varying electromagnetic field necessary to write the data to the corresponding data field on the disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, as shown by block <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, the detection circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> detects the time-varying electromagnetic field, or write-safe signal, which is the sum of the electromagnetic coupling effects of the preamplifier <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, the head <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the write-safe signal is generated in response to the electromagnetic fields from the write driver <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, the write element <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and the interconnect <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and not from the selective magnetization of the disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the detection circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> senses the operation of the constituent parts in real time, or on-the-fly, unlike conventional write verification schemes where the read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> subsequently transduces previously written data from the disc <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> the value of the write-safe signal is compared to a stored threshold value. If the write-safe signal is less than the threshold value then the data block is marked for subsequent evaluation in block <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. Such marking is typically achieved using a status register which indicates the status of the various data blocks of the disc drive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The routine next determines whether additional sets of data remain to be written at block <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>; if so, the next block of data is selected in block <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and control returns to block <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When all of the data has been written, the routine continues to block <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> which determines whether any of the accessed data blocks have been marked for further evaluation. If so, the first such marked data block is selected at block <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and a conventional read verification operation is performed at block <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. That is, the read element <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is positioned over the associated data block to transduce the selective magnetization of the data block to generate a readback signal that is presented to the read channel <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> for reconstruction. If any uncorrected errors are detected in the recovered data by block <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, the error recovery routines are applied at block <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> in an attempt to recover the data. Such routines can involve adjustment of various read channel and preamplifier parameters, application of a position offset to move the read element away a selected distance form the center of the track, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A determination is then made in block <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> as to whether the correction operation of block <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> was successful. If any uncorrected errors still remain, the data block is marked by block <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> for a rewrite operation. The routine continues to block <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> to determine whether additional data blocks have been marked for evaluation; if so, the next marked data block is selected at block <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and control returns to block <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In summary, the embodiments of the present invention contemplate a disc drive (such as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) comprising a rotatable disc (such as <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) having a magnetic recording surface, and a data reading and writing assembly (such as <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>). The data reading and writing assembly comprises a head (such as <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) comprising a write element (such as <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>) and a read element (such as <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>), both adjacent the recording surface; a preamplifier (such as <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>) comprising a write driver (such as <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>) applying a series of write currents (such as <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>) for writing data to the recording surface and a read amplifier (such as <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>) for reading stored data from the recording surface; and an interconnect (such as <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) joining the write driver to the write element so as to generate time-varying magnetic fields (such as <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>) selectively magnetizing the recording surface in response to the write currents, and joining the read amplifier to the read element so as to transduce magnetization vectors on the recording surface associated with stored data. The disc drive furthermore comprises a detection circuit (such as <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>) connected to the data reading and writing assembly, receiving a write-safe signal (such as <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>) indicative of a write-safe condition, the write-safe signal comprising a sum of constituent operable magnetic coupling values of the read/write head (such as <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>), the preamplifier (such as <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>)and the interconnect (such as <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the detection circuit is connected to the preamplifier and receives the write-safe signal when a bias current is directed to the read element while writing data to the recording surface, such that a reversal in the writing current (such as <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>) generates an electromagnetic coupling effect in the bias current. An advantageous construction comprises adaptively connecting the circuit to the analog buffer head voltage terminal (such as <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>) of the preamplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention further contemplate a method for writing data in a data storage device, comprising: (a) generating a write current signal associated with the data to be written with a write driver portion of a preamplifier; (b) transmitting the write current signal along an interconnect to a magnetoresistive write element portion of a read/write head to generate a time-varying electromagnetic field imparting flux transitions associated with the data in a data storage portion of the data storage device (such as <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>); (c) supplying a bias current to a read portion of the head; (d) while transmitting the write current, simultaneously reading an electromagnetic coupling signal comprising constituent coupling signals of the preamplifier, the interconnect and the read/write head (such as <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>); and (e) comparing the electromagnetic coupling signal to a threshold value indicative of a write-safe condition of the write element (such as <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of various embodiments of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of various embodiments of the invention, this disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of structure and arrangement of parts within the principles of the present invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.
