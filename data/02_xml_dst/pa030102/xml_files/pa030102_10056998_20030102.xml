<heading lvl="1">INTRODUCTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Collagen-based biomaterials are marketed by medical device manufacturers and used by surgeons worldwide to repair or regenerate a wide variety of tissues. Collagen can be processed into various physical forms including liquid, gel, paste, powder, sponge, film, and fiber. Collagen has been used as a hemostat and &lsquo;resorbable scaffold&rsquo; promoting formation of new bone, tendon, ligament, skin, urinary, vascular, and other connective tissues. Now, collagen is also being developed as a sealant, implant coating, adhesion barrier, and as a scaffold in tissue engineering devices. As these technologies advance, new markets will emerge. For example, collagen-based biomaterials are potentially useful for management of diabetic foot ulcers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Acid-insoluble bovine dermal (primarily type I) collagen is frequently utilized as an implantable biomaterial due to its availability, low antigenicity and ability to be processed into various configurations.

San Diego: Academic Press; 1996. p 84-94.) However, due to purification and processing of &lsquo;raw&rsquo; collagen into useful forms, collagenous biomaterials have relatively low strength and are highly susceptible to enzymatic breakdown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Collagen crosslinking is required to stabilize collagen-based biomaterials and tailor their strength, degradation rate, and tissue reaction following implantation. The mechanical properties of collagen materials are known to increase as a result of increased crosslink density. (Weadock K, Olsen R M, Silver F H. <highlight><italic>Evaluation of collagen crosslinking techniques. Biomat Med Dev Art Org </italic></highlight>1984;29:1373-1379; Koide T, Daito M. <highlight><italic>Effects of various collagen crosslinking techniques on mechanical properties of collagen film. Dent Mat J </italic></highlight>1997;16(1):1-9.) Specifically, the existence of intermolecular crosslinks are evidenced by increases in the breaking load and stiffness of the collagen films. Conversely, denaturation of collagen causes a decrease in the mechanical properties. (Weadock K S, Miller E J, Keuffel E L, Dunn M G. <highlight><italic>Effect of physical crosslinking methods on collagen-fiber durability in proteolytic solutions. J Biomed Mater Res </italic></highlight>1996;32:221-226.) In order to improve durability, collagen is typically crosslinked by chemical methods (aldehydes, isocyanates, carbodiimides) (Weadock K, Olsen R M, Silver F H. <highlight><italic>Evaluation of collagen crosslinking techniques. Biomat Med Dev Art Org </italic></highlight>1984;29:1373-1379; Nimni M E, Cheung D, Strates B, Kodama M, Sheik K. <highlight><italic>Bioprosthesis derived from crosslinked and chemically modified collagenous tissues</italic></highlight>.

Biomaterials </italic></highlight>1997;18(2):95-105.). However, although chemical crosslinkers stabilize collagen, they may compromise biocompatibility by releasing toxic residuals and have potential cytotoxicity concerns associated with their use (Huang-Lee L H, Cheung D T, Nimni M E. <highlight><italic>Biochemical changes and cytotoxicity associated with the degradation of polymeric glutaraldehyde derived crosslinks. J Biomed Mater Res </italic></highlight>1990;24:1185-1201; Khor E. <highlight><italic>Methods for the treatment of collagenous tissues for bioprostheses. Biomaterials </italic></highlight>1997;18(2):95-105.) Physical methods (ultraviolet irradiation and dehydrothermal treatment) may also be employed for collagen crosslinking. (Yannas I V, Tobolsky A V. <highlight><italic>Crosslinking of gelatine by dehydration. Nature </italic></highlight>1967;215:509-510; Rubin A L, Riggio R R, Nachman R L, Schwartz G H, Miyata T, Stenzel K H. <highlight><italic>Collagen materials in dialysis and implantation.

II. Dehydrothermal crosslinking. Int J Biol Macromol </italic></highlight>1992;14:129-138.) However, both ultraviolet irradiation and DHT have been shown to impart partial denaturation to the collagen molecule, thereby increasing its susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. (Gorham S D, Light N D, Diamond A M, Willins M J, Bailey A J, Wess T J, Leslie N J. <highlight><italic>Effect of chemical modifications on the susceptibility of collagen to proteolysis. II.

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Crosslinking collagen-based biomaterials with ultraviolet irradiation (UV) is rapid and effective, and has no associated risk of induced cytotoxicity. However, the concurrent partial denaturation of the collagen molecule which occurs during exposure to UV reduces strength and increases susceptibility to degradation by proteolytic enzymes. The induced partial denaturation is counteractive to the strength provided by crosslinks. (Weadock K S, Miller E J, Bellincampi L D, Zawadsky J P, Dunn M G. <highlight><italic>Physical crosslinking of collagen fibers: comparison of ultraviolet irradiation and dehydrothermal treatment. J Biomed Mater Res </italic></highlight>1995;29:1373-1379; Weadock K S, Miller E J, Keuffel E L, Dunn M G. <highlight><italic>Effect of physical crosslinking methods on collagen-fiber durability in proteolytic solutions. J Biomed Mater Res </italic></highlight>1996;32:221-226.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Glucose may also be employed to generate crosslinks in collagen. Glucose-derived crosslinks are produced via the Maillard reaction and the process is initiated by the glycosylation of collagen, which requires the glucose molecule to be in its linear form, exposing a reactive aldehyde group. (Bunn H F, Higgins P J. <highlight><italic>Reaction of monosaccharides with proteins: possible evolutionary significance. Science </italic></highlight>1981;213:222-224.) The aldehyde undergoes a condensation reaction with an amine group located on a lysine, hydroxylysine, or arginine amino acid side chain, forming a Schiff base. Subsequently, the Schiff undergoes Amadori rearrangement to form a ketoamine intermediate and further rearranges to an advanced glycosylated end-products (AGEs). Some AGEs can ultimately result in the formation of a crosslink via linkage to another amine group of a different amino acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Diabetes researchers have extensively studied the ability of glucose to generate crosslinks in proteins and the mechanisms involved. (Fu M-X, Wells-Knecht K J, Blackledge J A, Lyons T J, Thorpe S R, Baynes J W. <highlight><italic>Kinetics, mechanisms, and inhibition of late stages of the maillard reaction. Diabetes </italic></highlight>1994;43:676-683; Vlassara H, Bucula R, Striker L. <highlight><italic>Pathogenic effects of advanced glycosylation: biochemical, biologic, and clinical implications for diabetes and aging. Lab Invest </italic></highlight>1994;70(2):138-151; Monnier V M, Glomb M, Elgawish A, Sell D R. <highlight><italic>The mechanism of collagen cross-linking in diabetes. Diabetes </italic></highlight>1996;45(S67-S72); Sajithal G B, Chithra P, Chandrakasan G. <highlight><italic>Advanced glycation end products induce crosslinking of collagen in vitro. Biochim Biophys Acta </italic></highlight>1998;1407:215-224.) Some of these researchers are concerned with limiting some of the associated complications which exist with excessively crosslinked tissues of hyperglycemic patients (i.e. &lsquo;leatherized&rsquo; skin, loss of compliance in cardiovascular tissues). Several specific types of glucose-derived crosslinks have been identified and the mechanisms involved in their formation have also been proposed. (Baynes J W. <highlight><italic>Role of oxidative stress in development of complications in diabetes. Diabetes </italic></highlight>1991;40:405-412; Wassara H, Bucula R, Striker L. <highlight><italic>Pathogenic effects of advanced glycosylation: biochemical, biologic, and clinical implications for diabetes and aging. Lab Invest </italic></highlight>1994;70(2):138-151.) Recently, glucose has been reported as a means of crosslinking cell-seeded, tissue engineered products. (Girton T S, Oegema T R, Tranquillo R T. <highlight><italic>Exploiting glycation to stiffen and strengthen tissue equivalents for tissue engineering. J Biomed Mater Res </italic></highlight>1999;46:87-92.) However, these studies and the majority of the understanding of glucose-derived crosslinking have been obtained in vitro with processes of prolonged incubation (weeks to months) of collagen in hyperglycemic solutions under physiological conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Biomaterials are usually sterilized as final, packaged products by gamma-source radiation, which is a common method used for medical devices because it is effective and does not produce any potentially cytotoxic residual components. However, gamma irradiation denatures the collagen molecule, which both decreases its strength and increases its susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. Alternate sterilization methods (e.g., ethylene oxide) are potentially cytotoxic and require prolonged aeration to dissipate residual sterilant. Therefore, manufacturers of collagenous biomaterials must either accept the damage inflicted by gamma sterilization or abandon the use of collagenous materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to collagenous compositions and methods for making and using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention relates to compositions comprising a mixture of collagen and a sugar material which has been exposed to UV radiation, gamma radiation or both. The combination utilizes non-toxic crosslinking methods: glucose and UV, and a sterilization method: gamma radiation. The addition of the sugar material, provides further strength and integrity to collagen materials and limits the amount of UV-induced and gamma-induced denaturation. The combination also avoids the time-consuming incubation period required in the generation of glucose derived crosslinks where collagen is exposed to glucose only. The compositions comprise glucose-incorporated collagen exposed to UV and/or gamma and reduce the effects of UV-induced and gamma-induced denaturation and increase the physical and mechanical properties of collagen. In a further aspect, the collagenous composition has been exposed to gamma radiation subsequent to the UV irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention relates to methods for preparing collagenous compositions. The method involves mixing collagen with a sugar material, processing or casting the mixture into a physical form, and exposing the physical form of the mixture to ultraviolet irradiation (UV), gamma radiation or both. In a further aspect, the composition is exposed to gamma irradiation subsequent to exposure to UV. The physical forms of the mixture include, but are not limited to, films, sponges, fibers, liquids, gels, pastes, or powders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The collagen mixture comprises collagen and an appropriate solvent. The choice of collagen and an appropriate solvent will depend on the application for the collagen composition and the preference of the manufacturer of the collagen composition. For example, lyophilized acid soluble bovine dermal collagen and dilute hydrochloric acid (pH&equals;2.4) are a collagen solute and an appropriate solvent combination. Other sources of collagen, both acid soluble and insoluble, include: derivation from any animal tissue, produced with recombinant technology, or synthetically derived collagen-like peptides. Comparable proteins may also be used, such as, elastin, albumin or hemoglobin. Other appropriate solvents include any organic or inorganic acids and bases, or water. One skilled in the art will recognize that various combinations may be employed to produce the desired collagen mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;sugar material&rdquo; refers to monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides or any combination thereof, including, but not limited to, glucose, ribose, threose, galactose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, or maltose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The UV exposure occurs at wavelengths between 220 nm and 400 nm. The primary emission UV wavelength, time period for exposure, and distance of the physical form of the collagen compositions from the UV source are inter-dependent. As an example, where the primary emission is 254 nm, collagen compositions in physical form were exposed to the UV for 30-60 minutes at a distance between 4.5 to 6.0 inches from the UV source. Under these circumstances, the UV intensity averages between 4.00-7.11 mWatt/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the total energy delivered ranges between 7-26 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Variations in the primary emission wavelength, time period for exposure, and distance between the UV source and the composition may be employed to obtain a substantially similar result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Collagen-based biomaterials are commonly sterilized by exposure to gamma irradiation. Gamma dose sterilization typically involves irradiation between 0.05 and 6.0 megaRads, with 2.5 megaRads being typically acceptable for sterilization of medical devices. The level and duration of gamma radiation will depend on the characteristics and uses of the composition being sterilized. Although this method is quick, effective, and does not impart any potential cytotoxicity to the material, gamma sterilization of collagen has been reported to break down collagen, wherein the collagen molecule becomes fragmented. Fragmentation may lead to denaturation of the molecule and ultimately results in increased susceptibility to enzymatic degradation and loss of strength. Collagen compositions prepared by the process described herein are less susceptible to enzymatic degradation and maintain their strength after sterilization with gamma radiation. This property alone could change the way collagen-based biomaterials are sterilized, leading to new materials and uses. The incorporation of glucose into collagen synergistically enhances UV-induced crosslinking to yield a material with greater durability.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Collagen films were utilized as a model material to study the effects of glucose-incorporation (GLUC) and UV exposure on the physical properties of collagen biomaterials. The processing and evaluation methods of the collagen films are based on the work by Weadock et al. (Weadock K, Olsen R M, Silver F H. <highlight><italic>Evaluation of collagen crosslinking techniques. Biomat Med Dev Art Org </italic></highlight>1984;29:1373-1379.) The following four groups of collagen films were analyzed: No GLUC/No UV (control), GLUC, UV, and GLUC&plus;UV. Three different concentrations of glucose (3, 6, and 9 mM) were investigated. The approximate crosslink density and nativity of collagen containing glucose and exposed to UV were measured. The extent of denaturation and the degree of crosslinking were approximated in glucose-incorporated UV exposed collagen films by determining the mechanical properties of films under various conditions: 1) hydrated (PBS); 2) heat denatured (boiled in water); 3) incubated in collagenase solution (specific protease); and 4) incubated in trypsin solution (non-specific protease). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Collagen Film Preparation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Collagen films were cast from 0.5% (weight/volume) collagen dispersions made from lyophilized acid-insoluble bovine dermal collagen (Nitta Casings, Somerville, N.J.) in dilute hydrochloric acid (pH&equals;2.4). A stock dispersion (3200 ml) was generated by combining four 800 ml dispersions which were blended for 5 seconds at 1 minute intervals for 3 minutes (20 seconds total blending) in a bench-top blender. From the stock dispersion, four groups of dispersions were aliquotted (800 ml each). For GLUC films (3, 6, or 9 mM glucose), D&minus;(&plus;)&minus; glucose (99.5% anhydrous, Sigma) was added directly to the aliquotted dispersions and re-blended for 5 seconds. The 0 mM glucose group was also re-blended for 5 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> After blending, dispersions were transferred into a side-arm Erlenmeyer flask and a vacuum (Maxiam C-Plus&trade;, Fisher Scientific) was applied for five minutes at room temperature in order to de-aerate the dispersion. The final pH of all dispersions was 2.75&plusmn;0.05. Aliquots (50.0&plusmn;0.1 g) of dispersion were then poured into 9 cm&times;9 cm&times;1.5 cm polystyrene trays (Falcon, Becton Dickinson). The cast dispersions were then allowed to dry under ambient conditions for approximately 72 hours. Twelve films were cast per group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Exposure of Films to UV </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Half of the films (n&equals;6) from each group were exposed to UV. The films were placed in their trays on aluminum foil inside a UV crosslink chamber (Stratalinker 2400&trade;, Stratagene). The films were irradiated in ambient atmosphere for 60 minutes at a distance of 4.5 inches from a bank of 5 UV bulbs having a primary emission at 254 nm. At this distance the films were exposed to an average intensity of 7.11 mWatt/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the total energy delivered was 25.6 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Sixty minutes of UV exposure was chosen based on previously reported results generated in our laboratory which showed maximum crosslinking effects after 30 minutes. (Weadock K S, Miller E J, Bellincampi L D, Zawadsky J P, Dunn M G. <highlight><italic>Physical crosslinking of collagen fibers: comparison of ultraviolet irradiation and dehydrothermal treatment. J Biomed Mater Res </italic></highlight>1995;29:1373-1379.) After 30 minutes, no additional crosslinks formed, but denaturation continues and it is the effects of this denaturation that were analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Sample Preparation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Prior to evaluation, the collagen films were hydrated for 60 minutes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (150 mM NaCl, 9.2 mM Na2HPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and 1.1 mM Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>anhydrous, in distilled water, pH&equals;7.4) at room temperature. Each hydrated film was cut into six 1.4 cm&times;6.0 cm strips with a scalpel, yielding 36 strips per experimental group. The samples within a group were then placed into one beaker of PBS. For each test described below, strips were randomly selected from each beaker of pooled strips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Mechanical Properties of Hydrated Films </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The mechanical properties of collagen materials are known to increase as a result of increased crosslink density. (Weadock K, Olsen R M, Silver F H. <highlight><italic>Evaluation of collagen crosslinking techniques. Biomat Med Dev Art Org </italic></highlight>1984;29:1373-1379; Koide T, Daito M. <highlight><italic>Effects of various collagen crosslinking techniques on mechanical properties of collagen film. Dent Mat J </italic></highlight>1997;16(1):1-9.) Specifically, the existence of intermolecular crosslinks are evidenced by increases in the breaking load and stiffness of the collagen films. Conversely, denaturation of collagen causes a decrease in the mechanical properties. (Weadock K S, Miller E J, Keuffel E L, Dunn M G. <highlight><italic>Effect of physical crosslinking methods on collagen-fiber durability in proteolytic solutions. J Biomed Mater Res </italic></highlight>1996;32:221-226.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Hydrated film strips were tested in uniaxial tension at room temperature until failure on an Instron materials tester (Model 4201, Canton, Mass.). The gage length (L<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>) was set at 3 cm and the crosshead speed was set to 60 mm/min, resulting in a constant strain rate of 200% per minute. From the resultant force-deformation curves, the peak breaking force and the stiffness (slope of force-deformation curve) of the collagen strips was determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Mechanical Properties of Films after Heat Denaturation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Heat denaturation eliminates non-covalent bonds within a collagen matrix, but has no effect on the covalent crosslinks. (Kuntz E. <highlight><italic>Studies on mechanism of photosensitized crosslinking of collagen. Radiation Research </italic></highlight>1962;16:568; Bailey A J, Rhodes D N, Cater C W. <highlight><italic>Irradiation-induced crosslinking of collagen. Radiation Research </italic></highlight>1964;22:606-621.) The bonds that are disrupted are primarily the hydrogen bonds which are responsible for holding the triple helical structure of the collagen molecule intact. The mechanical properties of heat denatured collagen films are largely dependent on the presence of covalent, intermolecular crosslinks. After boiling, collagen films with fragmented peptide bonds and/or films devoid of crosslinks will become amorphous gels (gelatin), with minimal mechanical integrity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Five film strips from each group were immersed in boiling distilled water for 10 seconds. The mechanical properties of these heat-denatured films were then determined using the test conditions described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Mechanical Properties of Films after Exposure to Proteolytic Enzymes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The resorption rate of implanted collagenous materials is largely dependent on enzymatic degradation by specific and non-specific proteases. Uncrosslinked or denatured collagen molecules degrade relatively rapidly in the presence of bacterial collagenase. Bacterial collagenase cleaves between the &lsquo;X&rsquo; amino acid and glycine in the frequently occurring peptide sequence (-X-glycine-proline-Y-). (Hans S, Blumenfeld O, Seifter S. <highlight><italic>Specific identification of collagens and their fragments by clostidial collagenase and anti-collagenase antibody. Anal Biochem </italic></highlight>1992;201:336-342.) Crosslinks increase collagenase resistance via steric hindrance which prevents the enzyme from accessing the activation sites on the collagen molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Trypsin is a non-specific digestive enzyme that is not normally associated with the inflammatory or healing responses of biomaterials, but can be used to assess the extent of denaturation (or maintenance of nativity) of processed collagen materials. Trypsin is only capable of degrading non-helical regions of collagen; therefore partial denaturation (fragmentation or unraveling of the collagen triple helix) must occur in order for trypsin to degrade the molecule. (Wolff S P, Dean R T. <highlight><italic>Fragmentation of proteins by free radicals and its effect on their susceptibility to enzymic hydrolysis. Biochem J </italic></highlight>1986;234:399-403.) Trypsin cleaves peptide bonds found adjacent to the amino acids of lysine and arginine. (Stryer L. <highlight><italic>Biochemistry. </italic></highlight>3rd ed. New York City, W. H. Freeman and Company.) Native collagen is relatively resistant to trypsin degradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A 200 unit/ml bacterial collagenase (derived from <highlight><italic>Clostridium histolyticum</italic></highlight>, Sigma) stock solution was prepared in TRIS buffer aqueous solution (0.01 M TRIS-base and 0.025 M CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-2H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O in distilled water, pH&equals;7.4). A 1000 unit/ml trypsin (derived from bovine pancreas, Sigma) stock solution was prepared in PBS. Five strips per each film group were placed into a beaker containing 250 ml of either enzyme solution. The beakers were then covered and incubated in a covered water bath at 37&deg; C. After 240 minutes incubation, samples were removed from each group and immersed in PBS at room temperature until evaluated for mechanical properties as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Free Radical Scavengers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Thiourea (THIO) is an effective free radical scavenger and its ability to prevent UV-generated free radicals from fragmenting collagen chains was shown in using solutions of collagen. Thiourea (Sigma) was added directly into collagen dispersions and cast into films in order to determine if free radicals are implicated in the denaturation and/or crosslinking of collagen during exposure to UV. From a single stock collagen dispersion, the following groups of films were cast: a) Control, b) 6 mM thiourea, and c) 6 mM thiourea&plus;6 mM glucose. One half of the films from each group were exposed to UV for 60 minutes. The films were processed and evaluated for mechanical properties (hydrated, heat denatured, incubated in trypsin), according to the methods described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Inhibitors of Glucose-derived Crosslinking </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Aminoguanidine (AG) is a molecule capable of hindering the development of glucose-derived crosslinks. It has been shown to prevent the glycosylation of proteins and also to prevent the rearrangement of glycosylated proteins into crosslinks. Derived from a different stock collagen dispersion, eight groups of films were cast containing 0, 3, 6, or 9 mM AG (Sigma) and either 0 or 6 mM glucose. All films in these groups were exposed to UV for 60 minutes. The films were processed and evaluated for mechanical properties after heat denaturation, according to the methods described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> SDS-PAGE </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> An SDS-PAGE was conducted to assess the molecular state of the collagen after processing. SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide) was performed on the acetic acid (0.5 M) and pepsin (0.1 mg/ml) solubilized component of films (0.01 mg/50 &mgr;l). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Statistical Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Statistically significant differences between the control (No GLUC/No Uv) and experimental groups were determined for the data obtained from each test method by a student t-test. A p-value&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> RESULTS </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The combination of glucose-incorporation and exposure to UV showed pronounced effects in enhancing the physical and mechanical properties and enzyme resistance of the collagen films. The results suggest an increase in the degree of crosslinking and a decrease in the extent of denaturation of the GLUC&plus;UV collagen films. Without exposure to UV, the incorporation of glucose into the films had no effect for the short incubation time used. If GLUC films were allowed to incubate under physiological conditions for extended periods of time, glucose-derived crosslinks may form, enhancing their physical properties. Although three concentrations of glucose were investigated (3, 6, and 9 mM), no significant differences in the data were detected among these groups. The data from the 6 mM group with and without exposure to UV are reflected in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Thiourea eliminated the crosslinking and denaturation effects seen in films exposed to UV and aminoguanidine hindered the enhancement in the physical properties of GLUC&plus;UV films over UV films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The physical properties of collagen films crosslinked with UV and glucose (UV&plus;GLUC) have been characterized in vitro and exhibit a marked advantage over materials processed by conventional crosslinking methods (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Glucose-incorporation alone (no UV) did not alter the properties of the films. UV-exposure alone (no glucose) resulted in stronger films that were more denatured than controls, based on increased susceptibility to degradation by trypsin. When combined, however, glucose-incorporation and UV-exposure synergistically improved the physical properties of the collagen films, resulting in the strongest films with the greatest retention of strength following exposure to proteolytic enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> These data strongly suggest that GLUC&plus;UV films are more crosslinked than films treated with either GLUC or UV alone. Furthermore, the improved retention of mechanical properties after exposure to trypsin suggests that the GLUC&plus;UV films are less denatured than UV films. Collectively, these results suggest that a synergistic interaction occurs during UV irradiation of glucose-incorporated films, resulting in increased crosslinking, less denaturation, and a stronger and more stable collagenous biomaterial than that obtained by UV irradiation alone. UV exposure induces rapid formation of glucose-derived crosslinks in collagen; these crosslinks provide mechanical stability and limit the denaturation normally associated with UV-induced chain scission by preventing local unraveling of the collagen triple helix (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The addition of thiourea, a potent free radical scavenger, or aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of glucose-derived crosslinking, into the collagen films markedly hindered these synergistic effects. These data strongly suggest that free-radical dependent glucose-derived crosslinks provide the enhanced strength and enzyme resistance observed in glucose-incorporated, UV-exposed collagen films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Uncrosslinked Collagen (Control) Films </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The mechanical properties of uncrosslinked collagen films were relatively very weak. Approximately 50% of the breaking load and 25% of the stiffness were lost after boiling. After incubation in collagenase, the films were completely degraded (untestable) and, conversely, incubation in trypsin had no effect on the mechanical properties of the uncrosslinked films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Effects of GLUC on Collagen Films </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Glucose incorporation (GLUC) alone had no significant effect on the physical properties of the collagen films over the short incubation time of this study. The mechanical properties of hydrated and heat denatured GLUC films were comparable to the uncrosslinked (control) films. Glucose did not alter the susceptibility of the films to degradation by collagenase or affect the resistance to trypsin degradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Effects of UV on Collagen Films </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Exposure of collagen to UV caused significant increases in the hydrated and boiled mechanical properties. However, UV-exposed collagen films were completely degraded after incubation in collagenase. After incubation in trypsin, UV-exposed collagen films retained approximately 10% of their hydrated breaking load and 20% of their hydrated stiffness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Effects of GLUC and UV on Collagen </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The exposure of collagen films containing glucose to ultraviolet irradiation (GLUC&plus;UV) had pronounced effects on the overall physical properties of the films. The average breaking load of GLUC&plus;UV films was slightly higher than UV films. The average hydrated stiffness was significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) than both UV films and GLUC films. The boiled GLUC&plus;UV collagen films had higher average mechanical properties than boiled UV films, with the difference in breaking load being statistically significant (p&equals;0.036). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The resistance to proteolytic enzyme degradation of GLUC&plus;UV films was significantly greater than that of UV films. After incubation in collagenase, GLUC&plus;UV films retained more than 25% of the average hydrated breaking load and over 35% of the average stiffness. After incubation of GLUC&plus;UV films in trypsin, approximately 60% of both the hydrated breaking load and stiffness were retained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Effects of Thiourea </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Thiourea (THIO) had a major effect on the properties of UV and GLUC&plus;UV films (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Films containing thiourea exposed to UV had mechanical properties comparable to control films. GLUC&plus;UV films containing thiourea also had properties comparable to control films (GLUC&plus;UV&plus;THIO&equals;UV&plus;THIO&equals;control). The addition of thiourea had no effect on the physical properties of control films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Effects of Aminoguandine </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> AG had pronounced effects on mechanical properties of heat denatured GLUC&plus;UV films, essentially eliminating the increased strength over UV films (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The stiffness values of the boiled GLUC&plus;UV films containing AG decreased as the AG concentration increased from 0 to 9 mM. However, AG showed no significant effect on the boiled mechanical properties of UV films not containing glucose. The stiffness values of GLUC&plus;UV films with 6 and 9 mM AG were not significantly different from control films with AG (UV&plus;GLUC&plus;AG&equals;UV). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> SDS-PAGE </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The SDS-PAGE gel shows that collagen exposed to UV becomes fragmented and loses the typical band pattern associated with the raw, unprocessed collagen and the control film (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). GLUC&plus;UV films were comparably fragmented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Mechanical Properties of Hydrated and Heat Denatured Films </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Control and GLUC films had relatively low mechanical properties, with most of the strength provided by non-covalent bonding (as evidenced by the significant loss of strength after boiling). Consistent with previously reported results, exposure of collagen films without glucose to UV increased the hydrated and boiled mechanical properties as compared to control films. The mechanical properties of the hydrated and boiled GLUC&plus;UV films were greater than respective properties for UV films. Increased mechanical properties of hydrated collagen are indicative of a material with increased crosslink density and/or decreased amount of denaturation. The increases observed in mechanical properties of boiled collagen films suggest that the GLUC&plus;UV films have a greater crosslink density than UV collagen films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The breaking load and stiffness of the collagen films in this study were reported instead of the true mechanical properties (stress and modulus), due to issues involving the cross-sectional area (XSA) of the films strips. The calculation of stress and modulus values require the normalization of the structural properties by the XSA, which itself is dependent on the degree of crosslinking and denaturation. Due to increased swelling, a less crosslinked or greater denatured collagenous material would have a greater XSA. Therefore, resultant stress and modulus values would be exaggeratedly lower as compared to highly crosslinked materials, despite having comparable collagen content as crosslinked collagen. Since the dry weights of the film strips were not statistically different between groups (Table I), it was decided that the material content in the collagen film strips could be assumed to be equal, making normalization by hydrated XSA unnecessary.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Resistance to Proteolytic Enzymes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Both the control and the GLUC films were completely degraded by collagenase and were not susceptible to degradation by trypsin. These data suggest that collagen films with or without glucose and not exposed to UV have low crosslink density and are relatively non-denatured. As previously discussed, trypsin is only capable of degrading denatured and non-helical segments of the collagen molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> UV crosslinked collagenous materials exhibit adequate initial properties, but due to UV-induced denaturation, they experience rapid loss of strength after exposure to proteolytic enzymes. The enhanced resistance of GLUC&plus;UV to enzymatic degradation is a significant finding. The increased retention of mechanical properties of the GLUC&plus;UV collagen films after exposure to collagenase and trypsin is indicative of a material having increased crosslink density and less denaturation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Glucose did not have an inhibitory effect on the collagenase activity since GLUC films (without UV) were not resistant to collagenase degradation. Furthermore, UV-exposed collagen films were shown to degrade in collagenase and trypsin solutions containing 6 mM concentrations of glucose, suggesting further that the presence of &lsquo;unreacted&rsquo; glucose in the solution does not impede the activity of these proteases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The concentrations of enzyme solutions and incubation time (240 minutes) were chosen in order to maximize the differences between GLUC&plus;UV and UV films. The concentrations of enzymes used were assumed to be non-limiting. Perhaps at longer incubation times, collagenase and trypsin would be able to completely degrade the GLUC&plus;UV films. However, as an in vitro screening method, the concentrations and time periods chosen are adequate to show the increased resistance of GLUC&plus;UV films. This increased resistance may be indicative of prolonged implant duration post-implantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The model evaluated for collagen materials was in the form of films, a common model used for evaluating crosslinking methods. The results from these studies, however, are applicable to other forms of collagen materials, such as sponges, fibers, liquids, gels, pastes or powders (i.e. sponges for dermal repair, fibers for tendon/ligament reconstruction devices). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Since the effects of glucose were only detected after exposure to UV, it may be deduced that UV and/or UV-generated free radicals may initiate and expedite the process of glucose-derived crosslinking. Exposure of glucose to UV may cause the linearization of the molecule, prompting the glycosylation of the collagen and subsequent formation of glucose-derived crosslinks. This is in agreement with the effects of gamma irradiation on the enhancement of protein glycosylation. (Wolff S P, Dean R T. <highlight><italic>Glucose autoxidation and protein modification: the potential role of autoxidative glycosylation in diabetes. Biochem J </italic></highlight>1987;245:243-250.) Further, glucose-derived crosslinking has been shown to be expedited in the presence of oxygen free radicals, (Fujimori E. <highlight><italic>Cross</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>linking and fluorescence changes of collagen by glycation and oxidation.

Chem Pharm Bull </italic></highlight>1997;45(8):1243-1247.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The addition of thiourea into collagen films negated both the crosslinking and denaturation effects of UV. These data strongly suggest that the effects of UV on collagen are mostly due to generation of free radicals. Additionally, thiourea negated the effects of glucose induced by UV, therefore suggesting that the beneficial effects of glucose on collagen films may be entirely free-radical dependent. The SDS-PAGE reveals that the GLUC&plus;UV films are as fragmented as UV films, suggesting that glucose does not prevent UV-induced fragmentation, but must enhance the physical properties by generating or preserving cross-links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the addition of aminoguanidine into GLUC&plus;UV films negated the strength-inducing effects of the glucose, rendering them comparable to UV films. Since aminoguanidine had no effect on the physical properties of control films, it may be deduced that its effect on GLUC&plus;UV films was to prevent the onset of glucose-derived crosslinks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Although glucose-derived crosslinks may be the cause of the enhanced properties, it is possible that other mechanisms may be responsible. For example, the incorporation of glucose into collagen films and subsequent exposure to UV may simply result in the glycosylation of the collagen, without further development into actual crosslinks. This scenario would potentially explain the increases in mechanical properties and enzyme resistance. However, glycosylation would most likely not result in increased mechanical properties after boiling, since glycosylation is a reversible linkage. Furthermore, glycosylated collagen was shown to actually increase susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, (Tian S-F, Toda S, Higashino H, Matsumura S. <highlight><italic>Glycation decreases the stability of the triple-helical strands of fibrous collagen against proteolytic degradation by pepsin in a specific temperature range. J Biochem </italic></highlight>1996;120:1153-1162) contradicting the results presented here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, glucose may not be participating directly in the formation of crosslinks, but may be indirectly influencing crosslink formation. Similar to direct UV energy, UV-generated oxygen free radicals can both denature and crosslink collagen. (Curran S F, Amoruso M A, Goldstein B D, Berg R A. <highlight><italic>Degradation of soluble collagen by ozone or hydroxyl radicals. FEBS </italic></highlight>1984;176(1):155-160; Davies KJA. <highlight><italic>Protein Damage and Degradation by Oxygen Radicals. J Biol Chem </italic></highlight>1987;262(20):9895-9901; Ryu A, Naru E, Arakane K, Masunaga T, Shinmoto K, Nagano T, Hirobe M, Mashiko S. <highlight><italic>Cross-linking of collagen by singlet oxygen generated with UV-A. Chem Pharm Bull </italic></highlight>1997;45(8):1243-1247.) The glucose may be acting as a free radical scavenger (Yu B P. <highlight><italic>Cellular defenses against damage from reactive oxygen species. Physiological Reviews </italic></highlight>1994;74(1):139-162), preventing the denaturation effects of UV-generated free radicals. Alternatively, glucose may be generating free radicals (Chace K V, Carubelli R, Nordquist R E. <highlight><italic>The role of nonenzymatic glycosylation, transition metals, and free radicals in the formation of collagen aggregates. Arch Biochem Biophys </italic></highlight>1991;288(2):473-480; Yu B P. <highlight><italic>Cellular defenses against damage from reactive oxygen species. Physiological Reviews </italic></highlight>1994;74(1):139-162) during exposure to UV which may lead to the formation of additional crosslinks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The incorporation of glucose into collagen films and subsequent exposure to ultraviolet irradiation has pronounced effects. Increases were observed in mechanical properties and resistance to proteolytic enzyme degradation, as compared to films exposed to UV without glucose or films incorporated with glucose without UV exposure. Exposure of glucose-incorporated collagen materials to UV may expedite the generation of glucose-derived crosslinks, thus eliminating the need for prolonged incubations. Independent of the chemical mechanism involved, the synergistic effects of glucose and ultraviolet irradiation on the properties of collagen are evident. Ultraviolet irradiation and glucose-incorporation interact synergistically with collagen, resulting in stronger, more stable, and biocompatible collagen materials. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Collagen films were cast with and without incorporated glucose. Subsequently, these films were exposed to gamma radiation from a cobalt source, at a minimum exposure of 2.5 Megarads. Subsequently, these films were evaluated for their mechanical properties under the following conditions: hydrated, heat denatured (boiled) and incubated in trypsin, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Films, sponges, and fibers were all made from collagen dispersions. Preliminary studies established 6 mM as the optimal glucose concentration for making collagen dispersions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Collagen dispersions were made from lyophilized acid-insoluble bovine dermal collagen (Nitta Casings, Somerville, N.J.) in dilute hydrochloric acid (pH&equals;2.4). A stock dispersion of collagen (5000 ml) was generated by combining five 1000 ml dispersions which were blended for 5 seconds at 1 minute intervals for 3 minutes (20 seconds total blending) in a bench-top blender. From the stock dispersion, two groups of dispersions were aliquotted (2500 ml each), a GLUC containing dispersion and a control. For the GLUC dispersion, 6mM D-(&plus;)-glucose (99.5% anhydrous, Sigma) was added directly to the dispersion and re-blended for 5 seconds. The 0 mM glucose group (control) was also re-blended for 5 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> After blending, dispersions were transferred into a side-arm Erlenmeyer flask and a vacuum (Maxiam C-Plus&trade; Fisher Scientific) was applied for five minutes at room temperature in order to de-aerate the dispersion. The final pH of the dispersions was adjusted to 2.70&plusmn;0.05. Control and GLUC dispersions were used to make collagen films, sponges, and fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Films: Collagen films were cast by pouring aliquots (50.0&plusmn;0.1 g) of the dispersions into 9 cm&times;9 cm&times;1.5 cm polystyrene trays (Falcon, Becton Dickinson). The cast dispersions were then allowed to dry under ambient conditions for approximately 72 hours. Twenty-four films were cast per group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Sponges: Collagen sponges were made by pouring aliquots (50.0&plusmn;0.1 g) of the dispersions into 9 cm&times;9 cm&times;1.5 cm polystyrene trays (Falcon, Becton Dickinson). The cast dispersions were frozen and then freeze-dried for approximately 72 hours. Twenty-four sponges were cast per group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Fibers: Collagen fibers were made by extruding the dispersions through polyethylene tubing into a physiologic buffer, rinsing in water and alcohol, and hanging to dry. One hundred fibers were made per group. </paragraph>

The films were placed in their trays on aluminum foil inside a UV crosslink chamber (Stratalinker 2400&trade;, Stratagene). The films were irradiated in ambient atmosphere for 30 or 60 minutes at a distance of 4.5 or 6.0 inches from a bank of 5 UV bulbs having a primary emission at 254 nm. At this distance the films were exposed to an average intensity of 4.00 or 7.11 mWatt/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the total energy delivered ranges from about 7 to 26 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Prior to evaluation, the collagen materials were hydrated for 60 minutes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (150 mM NaCl, 9.2 mM Na2HPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and 1.1 mM Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>anhydrous, in distilled water, pH&equals;7.4) at room temperature. Films and sponges were cut into six 1.4 cm&times;6.0 cm strips with a scalpel, yielding 36 strips per experimental group. Fibers were cut into 6 cm lengths. The samples within a group were then placed into one beaker of PBS. For each test described below, strips were randomly selected from each beaker of pooled strips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Hydrated materials were tested in uniaxial tension at room temperature until failure on an Instron materials tester (Model 4201, Canton, Mass.). The gage length (L<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>) was set at 3 cm and the crosshead speed was set to 60 mm/min, resulting in a constant strain rate of 200% per minute. From the resultant force-deformation curves, the peak breaking force and the stiffness (slope of force-deformation curve) of the collagen materials was determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Heat Denaturation Samples </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Five samples from each group were immersed in boiling distilled water for 10 seconds. The mechanical properties of these heat-denatured materials were then determined using the test conditions described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Proteolytic Enzymes Samples </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A 200 unit/ml bacterial collagenase (derived from <highlight><italic>Clostridium histolyticum</italic></highlight>, Sigma) stock solution was prepared in TRIS buffer aqueous solution (0.01 M TRIS-base and 0.025 M CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;2H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O in distilled water, pH&equals;7.4). A 1000 unit/ml trypsin (derived from bovine pancreas, Sigma) stock solution was prepared in PBS. Five strips per each group were placed into a beaker containing 250 ml of either enzyme solution. The beakers were then covered and incubated in a covered water bath at 37&deg; C. After 240 minutes incubation, samples were removed from each group and immersed in PBS at room temperature and evaluated for mechanical properties as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Statistical Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Statistically significant differences between the control (No GLUC/No UV) and all experimental groups were determined for the data obtained from each test method by a student t-test. A p-value&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> RESULTS </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The hydrated strength of gamma-exposed collagen decreased as compared to the control while the glucose-incorporated films maintained their strength after gamma sterilization. The strength after heat denaturation of the glucose-incorporated films after gamma sterilization is approximately 5 times greater than films without glucose. This suggests that the glucose-incorporated films are more crosslinked. The gamma-sterilized films without glucose were completely degraded by the trypsin molecule, suggesting these films were highly denatured. The glucose-incorporated films, however, showed some maintenance of strength after incubation in trypsin. Similar to the effects seen with crosslinking with ultraviolet irradiation, the sterilization of glucose-incorporated films by gamma radiation may also induce crosslinking thus limiting the effects of gamma-induced denaturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the effects of gamma radiation on glucose-incorporated collagen films exposed to ultraviolet irradiation (UV&plus;GLUC) were also evaluated. The strength of films after incubation in collagenase was determined. Gamma irradiation had a detectable effect on the integrity and enzyme resistance of the films, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. However, UV&plus;GLUC films sterilized with gamma radiation were not highly denatured. Incorporation of glucose into collagen materials exposed to UV maintains strength and lessens gamma-induced denaturing effects compared to collagen without glucose. </paragraph>
