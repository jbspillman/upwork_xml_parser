</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to methods and apparatus for conducting electronic transactions. More particularly, the present invention relates to portable electronic authorization devices (PEADs) which advantageously and substantially eliminate the security risks associate with prior art techniques of approving transactions between a user and an electronic transaction system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for conducting electronic transactions. More particularly, the present invention relates to portable electronic authorization devices (PEADs) which advantageously and substantially eliminate the security risks associated with prior art techniques of approving transactions between a user and an electronic transaction system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electronic transaction systems are known. An electronic transaction system typically permits a user to conduct designated transactions electronically, which substantially improves efficiency and convenience to the user. Examples of electronic transactions include transactions conducted via computer networks, automated teller machines (ATM&apos;s), automated point-of sale systems, automated library systems, and the like. Transactions conducted via computer networks may encompass a wide range of transactions, including exchanging information and data via a computer network popularly known as the Internet, e.g., to make a purchase from a vendor on the network. ATM&apos;s typically permit users to conduct financial transactions (such as withdrawals, transfers, deposits, and the like) vis-&agrave;-vis a financial institution in an electronic manner. Automated point-of-sale systems may be employed by merchants to permit users to purchase products or services using the users&apos; electronic account, and automated library systems may be employed to permit library users to check out and return library materials. Other examples of electronic transaction systems are readily available in popular literature and are not enumerated herein for brevity sake. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To enhance security to the user&apos;s account, electronic transaction systems typically request the user to provide identification data to authenticate himself as the user authorized to approve the proposed transaction or transactions. If the user fails to provide the requested identification data, the proposed transaction or transactions are not authorized and will not be processed. The identification data may be required with each transaction. By way of example, an automated point-of-sale system may require the user to approve a purchase transaction and will accept an approval message only if it is satisfied that the person approving the transaction has furnished adequate identifying data authenticating himself as the person authorized to perform the approval. Alternatively, the identification data may be entered by the user at the start of a session to authenticate himself and enable that user to subsequently perform any number of transactions without further authentication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, users are typically required to manually enter the identification data into the electronic transaction system for authentication. Typically, the entry of identification data involves typing in a password on a numeric keypad or on a keyboard. The identification data is then compared with data previously stored within the electronic transaction system, and authentication is satisfied when there is a match. As mentioned previously, the transaction or transactions proposed will not be allowed to proceed if there is no match. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although prior art electronic transaction systems provide some protection from unauthorized access and use of the user&apos;s account, there are disadvantages. To illustrate certain disadvantages associated with prior art electronic transaction systems, reference may be made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> herein. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an automated teller machine (ATM) <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, representing the requesting device of an electronic transaction system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Electronic transaction system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may include, for example, a central database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which contains previously-stored identification data and account data of user <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To initiate a typical transaction with ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, user <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> first inserts a data card <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, such as a bank card or a credit card, into a card reader <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. Data card <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> typically includes a magnetic stripe that contains the account number and other information related to the user, which may then be read by card reader <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The data stored in data card <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> enables electronic transaction system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to ascertain which account in database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> user <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> wishes to transact business. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Via a keypad <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, user <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may then be able to enter his identification data, e.g., his personal identification number (PIN), to authenticate himself. If the entered identification data matches the identification data stored with the account in database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that is identified by data card <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, the user is authenticated and granted access to his account. If there is no match, authentication fails. After authentication, user <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be able to, for example, employ a combination of keypad <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a screen <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to withdraw cash from his account, which results in cash being dispensed from ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the balance in his account within database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> correspondingly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Theoretically, the identification data entered into ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> should be secure. In reality, there are many potential security risks to the identification data in prior art authentication techniques. Since the identification data is not encrypted before being entered into ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the non-encrypted identification data is vulnerable to unauthorized access and procurement. Encryption of the identification data is not practical in the prior art since it would have been too complicated and/or inconvenient for the user to perform encryption or memorize the encrypted identification data. Unauthorized procurement of the identification data in the prior art may occur, for example, upon entry if it is inadvertently seen by another party, e.g., by another person behind user <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, either on screen <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or more likely at keypad <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Even if encryption is employed on the identification data in the prior art, e.g., prior to transmission from ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to database <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the encryption typically occurs within ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and still requires the entry of non-encrypted identification data from user <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the existence of the identification data for some duration of time in ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Unauthorized access to the identification data may then occur if an unauthorized party is able to gain entry into ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and intercepts, e.g., via software or hardware implemented in ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the non-encrypted identification data therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if public key cryptography is employed within ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the storage of the user&apos;s private key within ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> renders this private key vulnerable to theft, further exposing the user&apos;s account to risk. The stolen password and/or private key may then be employed to allow unauthorized persons to access the user&apos;s account to the user&apos;s detriment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, there are desired apparatus and methods for conducting transactions with the electronic transaction system while substantially eliminate the risk of unauthorized access to the user&apos;s account and unauthorized procurement of the user identification data. Preferably, such an apparatus should be easily portable to permit the user to conveniently and comfortably perform transaction authentication anywhere. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A method is disclosed for permitting a user to conduct a charged transaction utilizing a charge terminal of an electronic transaction system, the charge card terminal being configured to interface with a charge card for the purpose of conducting the charge card transaction, providing a merchant card to a merchant where the charge card transaction is to be conducted, comprising accepting at a charge card terminal for the merchant where the charge card transaction is to be conducted to accept the merchant card and a pin number or cellular phone number from the user conducting the charge card transaction, detecting the use of the merchant card at a central processing area, in response to said detection step, utilizing the phone number or pin number to cause a call to be placed to a cellular phone of a person required to authorize the charge card transaction, sending a report of the users charge card transaction to the cellular phone, and authorizing approval of the charge card transaction back to the merchant&apos;s charge card terminal only upon approval by the authorized person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The merchant may further enter the amount to be charged and an identification of the type transaction being conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The merchant card may be assigned a valid credit card number, the valid credit card number of the merchant being detected to initiate the step of calling the authorizing persons cellular phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The method may comprise the further step of filtering all credit card transactions from the charge card terminal of the merchant through a central processing server, and in response to that filtering step, if the card number received from the merchant is not a unique merchant assigned number, then the server does nothing, or if the card number is a unique merchant assigned number, then look up information in the database in the payment server using the phone number or pin number as the index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The method may also comprise the payment server using the transaction associated phone number or pin number as an index to a database which stores a cellular phone number for the person required to authorize the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the method the database may further store a record of whether the authorizer cellular phone has an imbedded PEAD. Upon determining that the authorizing person&apos;s cellular phone has a PEAD, the server sends a transaction message to the authorizing person&apos;s phone for approval using a PEAD imbedded in the phone, the authorizing person approving the transaction by entering a pin number at the cellular phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> If the database lookup indicates that the authorizing person&apos;s cellular phonies a touchtone phone, then the server will send a message to the authorizing person&apos;s cellular phone requesting a dial tone for approval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The database server may utilize an interactive voice response system to convey the transaction information to the authorizing person&apos;s cellular phone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Upon the authorizing person authorizing/approving the transaction, a settlement may be; made to the authorizing person&apos;s account utilizing an account selected from the group comprising a credit card, an ATM, a bank account or a debit card. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention further relates to a Payment System (EPS) for conducting a payment with a phone number and using a PEAD or a cellular phone to approve the payment. In order to integrate into the existing Point-of-Sales system, a valid credit card number is reserved as an eSignX Merchant Card number (EMC number). For a user registered his phone number (preferably his/her cellular phone number) in the eSignX Payment System, can pay at the Point-of-Sales by giving his phone number to a merchant. A merchant can swipe the eSignX Merchant Card (EMC) and then enter a customer cellular phone number, amount to charge and other optional information. Since the EMC number is a valid credit card number, therefore the phone number and charging information will route through the existing payment settlement infrastructure such as Visa or MasterCard and will be processed by existing data processor such as First Data Corp. (FDC). The current invention only need to install an eSignX Payment Server in the existing infrastructure to capture the unique EMC number by filtering all the charging card numbers route through the system. If the card number is not the unique EMC number, then do nothing. If the card number is the unique EMC number, then look up the database in the eSignX Payment Server using the phone number as the index. If the lookup result indicates that the user&apos;s cellular phone has a PEAD embedded such as a WAP phone with WIM card or SWIM card or a Java Phone with xDSM software PEAD module, then the eSignX Payment Server will send a transaction message to user&apos;s phone for approval using a PEAD embedded in the phone. If the lookup result indicates that the user&apos;s cellular phone is a touch tone phone, then the eSignX Payment Server will go through an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system to call the user&apos;s cellular phone for dial tone PIN for approval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A sample transaction can be understood by reference to the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> which illustrates those basic physical elements of this embodiment as well as the data flow in the use of this method and apparatus. As a first step, when a transaction is to be authorized at a merchant, for a user of this system to pay at the point-of-sale, the user simply registers his phone number, which is preferably his or her cellular phone number in the eSignX payment system prior to the transaction, and then pays at the point-of-sale by giving this phone number to the merchant. Of course, it would be equivalent to also register a pin number and give a pin number to the merchant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In either case, having received the pin number of cellular phone number, the merchant swipes a merchant card issued by eSignX in a standard card swipe machine <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> which would be of the same type as is currently used to swipe credit cards. After swiping the merchant card, the merchant then enters the customer cellular phone number (or pin number), the amount to charge, and other optional information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Since the EMC number read by the machine <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> is a valid credit card number, then the phone number and charging information can be routed through the existing payment settlement infrastructure such as used by Visa or MasterCard, and processed by an existing data processor, such as First Data Corporation, which maintains a large-scale data processing center <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> to which the entered data is directed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In addition to the data processing already conducted at this center, the current approach only needs the installation at this site <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> or another of a payment server dedicated to capturing the data entered using the EMC merchant card <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. This can be done using a server <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> which can be incorporated into the main data processing center <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> either before or after the data processing normally conducted at the credit card data processing center. The function of the payment server <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> in the existing infrastructure is to capture the unique merchant indication (EMC) number from the merchant card <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, preferably by filtering all charging card numbers routed through the system. If the card number is not a unique EMC number from an EMC card <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, then the merchant card payment server, <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> does nothing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> If the card number is a unique merchant (EMC) number, then the data is immediately diverted to the EMC payment server <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>; to look up in the database all available information relating to the person who must authorize the transaction (which may or may not be the issuer) in the payment server using the phone number or pin number as the index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Approval can then concurrently with the transaction being conducted from the cellular phone <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to which the cellular phone number or pin is directed; this may or may not be a cellular phone held by the person seeking to conduct a transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> If the lookup result at the payment server <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> indicates that the user&apos;s cellular phone has a PEAD imbedded such as a WAP phone or WIM card, SWIM card or Java phone with xDSM software PEAD module, then the payment server <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> sends a transaction message to the authorizer&apos;s phone <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> for approval using a PEAD imbedded in the phone. Upon the holder of the cellular phone with the PEAD receiving the message, they can enter an approval code, or ignore the message or enter a disapproval code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the alternative, if the lookup result indicates that the user&apos;s cellular phone is a touchtone phone, then the payment server <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> sends a message or goes through an interactive voice response system to call the user&apos;s cellular phone to request a dialin pin of approval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In either case, the holder of the cellular phone <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> with which the cellular phone number or pin number is associated, maintains control of the approval of the transaction, whether or not they are present at the site of the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a portable electronic authorization device (PEAD) <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, representing the apparatus for securely approving transactions conducted vis-&agrave;-vis an electronic transaction system. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, requesting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may initiate a transaction approval process with PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by transmitting to PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, via communication port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a transaction request pertaining to a proposed transaction. Requesting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may represent, for example, an ATM machine, a computer terminal in a network, an automated library check-out terminal, or similar devices for permitting the user to transact business with the electronic transaction system. The proposed transaction may be, for example, a sale transaction of a particular item for a certain amount of money. The transaction request itself may include, for example, the transaction ID, the merchant&apos;s name, the merchant&apos;s ID, the time of the proposed purchase, and the like. In one embodiment, the transaction request from requesting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be encrypted for enhanced security but this is not required. Data pertaining to the proposed transaction reaches PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> via path <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may represent an infrared port to facilitate infrared communication with PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may represent a wireless port for facilitating wireless communication. Port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may even represent a contact-type connection port, such as a magnetic read/write mechanism or a plug having electrical contacts for directly plugging PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into port <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to facilitate communication. Other techniques to facilitate communication between requesting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are readily appreciable to those skilled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The data pertaining to proposed transaction(s) may then be reviewed by the user, either on a screen <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of requesting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> or optionally on a display screen provided with PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). If the user approves the transaction, e.g., a purchase of an item for a given amount of money, the user may then signify his approval by activating a switch <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> on PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which causes an approval message to be created with the user&apos;s identification data, encrypted and transmitted back to requesting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via path <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. If the transaction is not approved, the user may simply do nothing and let the transaction request times out after an elapsed time or may activate another switch on PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which causes a reject message, either encrypted or non-encrypted, to be transmitted back to the requesting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via path <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The present invention is different from the prior art technique of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in that the user is required in the prior art to enter his identification data into the electronic transaction system, e.g., into ATM <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to authenticate himself. In contrast, the present invention keeps the identificatin data related to the user secure within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at all times. Transaction approval occurs within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the data representing such approval is encrypted, again within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, prior to being transmitted to the elctgronic transaction system, e.g., to requesting device <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, even if the approval data is intercepted, its encryption would prevent unauthorized users from employing the identification data for illicit purposes. If publickey cryptography is employed to encrypt the approval data the user&apos;s private key is also always kept within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Since the user&apos;s private key is required for encryption and is unknown to others, even to the electronic transaction system in one embodiment, the encrypted approval dta, if intercepted, would be useless to unauthorized third parties even if the approval data can be deciphered using the user&apos;s public key. Again, this is different from prior art authentication techniques wherein encryption takes place within the electronic transaction system and requires the entry of the identification data and/or reading the user&apos;s private key from the ID card such as an ATM card, a credit card, and the like. As mentioned earlier, the fact that the prior art electronic transaction system requires this identification data and/or user&apos;s private key exposes these data to risks, e.g., if the requesting device is not secure or open to data interception via software or hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As another difference, the present invention employs the circuitries within the portable electronic authorization device (PEAD) to perform the approval and encryption of the transaction approval data within the PEAD itself. In contrast, prior art data cards are essentially passive devices. For example, prior art ATM cards or credit cards only has a magnetic stripe for storing account information and do not have any facility to perform approval and/or encryption of the transaction approval data. While smart cards of IC cards, which are currently being developed, may contain electronic circuitries, current standards for their implementation still requires a reader associated with the requesting device to read out the identification data and/or user&apos;s private key in order for the requesting device to perform any approval and/or encryption. As mentioned earlier, the transmission of these data to the requesting device unnecessarily exposes these data to risks of theft and/or unauthorized interception once transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It should be borne in mind at this point that although public key cryptography is discussed throughout this disclosure to facilitate ease of understanding and to highlight a particular aspect of the invention, the overall invention is not limited to any particular cryptography algorithm and may be implemented using any conventional cryptography technique, including public key cryptography algorithms such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, other discrete logarithm systems, elliptic curve systems, or the like. For additional information on some of the different public key cryptography techniques, reference may be made to, for example, the IEEE P1363/D8 Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography dated Oct. 5, 1998, available from IEEE Standards Dept. 345 East 7<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>Street, New York, N.Y. 10017-2349. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, transaction approval in the prior art occurs within the electronic transaction system. In contrast, the present invention allows transaction approvals to occur within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The fact that transaction approvals occur entirely within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> provides many advantages. By way of example, this feature eliminates the need to have, in one embodiment, the identification data and/or the user&apos;s private key in the requesting device. The fact that transaction approvals occur entirely within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (using the user identification data and/or the user&apos;s private encryption key that are always kept secure within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) substantially enhances the confidentiality of the user identification data and the user&apos;s private key, as well as the integrity of the transaction approval process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Since approval occurs entirely within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the user identification data that is employed to authenticate transactions may be more complicated and elaborate to ensure greater security. By way of example, the user identification data may be more elaborate than a simple password and may include any of the user&apos;s name, his birth date, his social security number, or other unique biometrics or unique identifying data such as fingerprint, DNA coding sequence, voice print, or the like. In contrast, prior art authentication techniques limit the user identification data to simple patterns, e.g., simple password of few characters, that are easily memorized by the user since more elaborate identification data may be too difficult to remember or too cumbersome to manually enter. Furthermore, even if the complicated ID data may be stored in the prior art data card, it is still required to be read into the requesting device of the electronic transaction system, again exposing this data to interception or theft once read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Additional safeguards, which will be described in detail herein, may also be provided to prevent access, whether electronically or by physical means, to the user identification data and/or the user&apos;s private key within PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Since the identification data and/or the user&apos;s private key are never exposed, security risks to the these data are substantially minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows, in one embodiment of the present invention, a simplified schematic of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, including switch <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Data path <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is provided for receiving transaction requests from the electronic transaction system, and data path <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is provided for transmitting transaction approval data back to the electronic transaction system. It should be borne in mind that although two data paths and other data paths herein may, in one embodiment, represent logical data paths and may be implemented via a single physical data connection. Likewise, the different ports herein may represent, in one embodiment, logical data ports for ease of understanding and may in fact be implemented using a single physical port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When a transaction request, e.g., a withdrawal transaction from an ATM machine in the amount of $200.00, is transmitted via data path <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, this transaction is received by encryption logic <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. At this point, the user may review the proposed transaction, e.g., via the display screen provided with the electronic transaction system and/or PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and has a choice to either approve or disapprove the proposed transaction. If the user approves the transaction, he may, in one embodiment, activate a switch <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which causes the transaction approval data to be created and then encrypted by encryption logic <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> prior to being transmitted back to the electronic transaction system via path <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Note that the user identification data block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, which is employed in the transaction approval process, is not directly coupled to paths <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. In other words, the memory portion storing the user identification data is intentionally decoupled from the input and output ports of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to prevent direct access thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> If access to user identification data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is desired, e.g., to approve a transaction, the access can only be made by encryption logic block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Likewise, it is not possible to directly access the memory portion <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which stores the user&apos;s private key. If access to user&apos;s private key <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is desired, e.g., to encrypt the transaction approval data, the access can ohnly be made by encryption logic block <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. It should be borne in mind that although user identification <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and user&apos;s private key <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are shown stored in different memory portions, such illustration is made for ease of understanding and both of these may in fact be stored, in one embodiment, at different addresses on the same memory module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In some cases, the transaction approval data requires the inclusion of certain pieces of identification data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. For example, a transaction embodied in the transaction request from the electronic transaction system may be appended with data representative of an &ldquo;electronic signature&rdquo; prior to being encrypted and retransmitted back to the electronic transaction system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows, in one embodiment, the format of representative transaction approval data <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, transaction data <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, representing a portion of or the entire transaction request received from the electronic transaction system, is appended with certain user identification data <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and optionally a time stamp <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. The formation of transaction approval data <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> only occurs if the transaction request has already been approved by the user. Once appended, transaction approval data <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is then encrypted prior to being retransmitted back to the electronic transaction system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In some cases, it may be desirable to encrypt the transaction request prior to transmission to the PEAD to further enhance security. For example, certain transaction partners, e.g., venders or other users on the computer network, may wish to keep the information within a transaction request confidential and may prefer to encrypt the transaction request before furnishing it to the PEAD. Data encryption is also desirable when, for example, the user identification data and the user&apos;s private key is written into a blank PEAD for the first time to configure a PEAD that is unique to a given user. The configuration data pertaining the user identification data and the user&apos;s private key, while must be written only once into the PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by the user of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is preferably encrypted to render them less vulnerable to theft. Issuers of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may represent, for example, credit card users, the government, or any other institution with whom the user maintains and account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a schematic of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> further employs decryption logic for receiving the encrypted configuration data and optionally the encrypted transaction requests. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, encryption logic <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, user&apos;s private key <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and data paths <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> are arranged and function substantially as discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Transaction requests are normally non-encrypted, i.e., they are received and processed in the manner discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. For highly sensitive transactions, however, the transaction requests may be encrypted and transmitted to PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> via data path <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and input into decryption logic <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to be decrypted. If a public key cryptography is employed, the encrypted transaction requests may be decrypted with a transaction partner public key <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Once decrypted, the transaction request is then displayed to the user for approval. The transaction approval data may be furnished to encryption logic <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> via path <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to be encrypted if approved, e.g., responsive to the activation of switch <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The encryption is preferably performed with the users private key <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> if a public key cryptography technique is employed, and the encrypted transaction approval data is then transmitted back to the electronic transaction system via data path <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As configuration data typically includes sensitive user identification data and user&apos;s private key, it is often encrypted prior to being transmitted to PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> via data path <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. The encrypted configuration data is received by decryption logic <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and decrypted therein prior to being written into user identification data block <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and user&apos;s private key block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. If public key cryptography is employed, the encrypted configuration data may be encrypted by the user&apos;s private key in the electronic transaction system prior to transmission and decrypted once received by PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with an issuer public key <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Note that once the configuration data is decrypted and written into user identification data block <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and user&apos;s private key block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the user identification data and user&apos;s private key can only be accessed subsequently by encryption logic <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Also note that there is no direct connection from any of the I/O data paths, e.g., data path <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, to user identification data block <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> as well to user&apos;s private key block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the sensitive user identification data and user&apos;s private key therein are not susceptible to access from outside once written into respective blocks <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (which may, in one implementation, simply represent memory blocks in PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>&apos;s memory). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the user identification data and the user&apos;s private key cannot be updated by those not having the issuer&apos;s private key. As represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, data can only be written into user&apos;s private key block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and user identification bloc <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> after it is decrypted via decryption logic <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> with issuer public key <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, unless the updated configuration data has been encrypted using the issuer&apos;s private key (which is presumably highly secure), the updated configuration data will not be decrypted and written into respective blocks <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Of course if the configuration data within blocks <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> cannot be updated physically, e.g., they are stored using memory that can be written only once such as PROM (programmable read-only memory), WORM (write once, read many), or the like, the security consideration associated with unauthorized alteration of configuration data is substantially eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> If a greater level of security is desired, the user&apos;s private key may be optionally be scrambled or randomized prior to being written into user&apos;s private key block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> by optional scrambler/descrambler logic <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>. Scrambler/descrambler logic <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> may, in one embodiment, receive the user&apos;s private key, which is furnished by the institution that issues PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the user, and scrambles and/or randomizes it to generate yet another user&apos;s private key and a corresponding user&apos;s public key. This scrambled/randomized user&apos;s private key is then stored in user&apos;s private key block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which is now unknown even to the issuer of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the corresponding user&apos;s public key may be made known to the issuer and/or the transaction partners to facilitate transactions. Advantageously, there is no other copy of the scrambled/randomized user&apos;s private key anywhere else beside within user&apos;s private key block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, there may be employed an optional key generation logic <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> which, responsive to a request from the issuing institution, generates the user&apos;s private key and the user&apos;s public key on its own, i.e., without first requiring the receipt of a user&apos;s private key from the issuing institution and randomizing it. The generated user&apos;s private key is then stored in private key block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the public key is made known to the issuing institution and/or the transaction partners to facilitate transactions. In this manner, no version of the user&apos;s private key, whether randomized or not, exists outside the PEAD itself. As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the use of key generation logic <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> further enhances the confidentiality of the user&apos;s private key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> represents, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a high level hardware implementation of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes logic circuitry <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, which may represent a central processing unit such as a microprocessor or a microcontroller, discrete logic, programmable logic, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or the like, for implementing encryption logic <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and optionally decryption logic <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Program/data memory <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> stores, among others, the codes which operate PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as well as the user identification data and the user&apos;s private key. Program/data memory <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is preferably implemented using some form of non-volatile memory (NVM) such as flash memory, electrically programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable, programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), or the like. Temporary memory <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> serves as a scratch pad for calculation purposes and for temporary storage of data, and may be implemented using some form of random access memory (RAM) such as static RAM or dynamic RAM, which are known in the art. Alternatively, either optical memory, magnetic memory, or other types of memory may be employed to implement program/data memory <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and/or temporary memory <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A bus <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> couples program/data memory <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and temporary memory <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> with logic circuitry <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Communication port <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> represents the communication gateway between PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the electronic transaction system and may be implemented using infrared technology wireless RF technology, a magnetic read/write head, a contact-type plug for facilitating serial or parallel data transmission, or the like. Communication port may also represent, in one embodiment, a PC card port (popularly known to those skilled as a PCMCIA card). Data path <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> inputs transaction requests into logic circuitry <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> while data path <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> outputs transaction approval data from logic circuitry <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to the electronic transaction system. Optional data path <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, which has been described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, inputs configuration data into PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to write the user identification data and the user&apos;s private key into program/data memory <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to uniquely configure PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to a particular user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Again, note that access to program/data memory <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the data therein (e.g., the user identification data and the user&apos;s private key) can only be made by logic circuitry <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. For example, the user identification data and the user&apos;s private key can only be written into program/data memory <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> if this data has been properly encrypted with the issuer&apos;s private key. Access to these memory blocks for writing thereto may also be restricted by logic circuitry <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> under appropriate software and/or firmware control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Similarly, reading the user identification data and accessing the user&apos;s private key can only be accomplished via the encryption logic of logic circuitry <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The advantages to security of this aspect has been discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4</cross-reference>, the most important point being there is preferably no direct access to the sensitive user identification data and user&apos;s private key from the outside. Consequently, the confidentiality and security of these data items are greatly enhanced with the inventive design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Some type of power source, such as a battery, may be provided as well. If PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is implemented as a single-chip design, i.e., substantially all components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> are fabricated on a single die, then power is external to the die itself. If contact-type communication is employed, e.g., if PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> must be plugged into the electronic transaction system to conduct transactions, power external to the PEAD may be employed for transaction approvals when plugged in, thereby eliminating the size, weight, and cost penalties associated with having a battery onboard the portable transaction apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be implemented using a general purpose portable computing device, such as any of the miniaturized portable computers or personal digital assistants (PDA&apos;s thar are currently popular. A PDA such as the Apple Newton&reg;, for example, may be employed to implement PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> illustrates one implementation of a PEAD wherein the circuitries are implemented on an IC. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, components having like reference numbers to components in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> have similar functions. Data paths <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, which have bene described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, is coupled to a serial I/O circuit <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, which facilitates data transmission and receipt in a serial manner on data path <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> between PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the electronic transaction system. Vcc pin <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> and ground pin <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, which provide power to PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, are also shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> represents an external view of the PEAD of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> after being embedded in a card-like package for ease of carrying and insertion into a serial I/O port of the electronic transaction system. Card <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, which embeds the integrated circuit implementing the inventive PEAD, includes, in one embodiment, four external contacts. External serial contacts <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> carry data and ground respectively to facilitate serial communication with a serial device of an electronic transaction system. External Vcc contact <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> and external ground contact <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, which supply power to the PEAD as discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, are also shown. When card <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is inserted into an electronic transaction system, it is powered through external contacts <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling the PEAD circuitries therein to receive transaction requests via external serial contacts <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>, approve the requests within the PEAD if appropriate, encrypt transaction approval data within the PEAD circuitries, and serially communicate the encrypted transaction approval data to the electronic transaction system via external serial contacts <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> represents an external view of PEAD in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is preferably implemented as a small, self-containing package that is sufficiently ruggedized for daily use in the field. Preferably, PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is small enough to be comfortably carried with the user at all times, e.g., as a key chain attachment or a small package that can easily fit inside a purse or a wallet. The physical enclosure of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is preferably arranged such that the content will be tamper-proof (i.e., if it is opened in an unauthorized manner then the user&apos;s private key and/or the user identification data will be destroyed or the PEAD will no longer be able to approve transactions). By way of example, the enclosure may be arranged such that if it is opened, there is a change in the flow of current in a current path, e.g., either the existing current flow is interrupted or a current path that has been idle starts to flow. The change in the flow of current may then force RE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> There is shown an infrared communication port <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> for receiving and transmitting data vis-&agrave;-vis the electronic transaction system. A small on/off switch <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> permits the user to turn off the PEAD to conserve power when not in use. Approve button <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> permits the user to signify approval of a proposed transaction. Optional skip button <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> permits the user to indicate rejection of a particular transaction. Skip button <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> may be omitted since a transaction request may be understood, in some embodiment, as not being approved if approve button <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> is not activated within a given period of time after receiving the request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Optional display <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> may be implemented using any type of display technology such as liquid crystal technology. Displays <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> displays, among others, the transaction being proposed for approval. Display <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> may be omitted if desired, in which case the transaction may be viewed, for example, at a display associated with the electronic transaction system itself. Optional user authentication mechanism <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> prevents PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from being used for approving transaction sunless the user is able to identify himself to PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as the rightful and authorized user. Optional user authentication mechanism <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> may require the user to enter a password, to furnish a fingerprint or a voice print, or other biometrics and/or identifying characteristics specific to the authorized user before PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be activated and employed for approving transactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> illustrates, in a simplified manner and in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the hardware for impelmenting PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. Battery <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> provides power to the circuitry of PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A microcontroller <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> executes codes stored in flash memory <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight> and employs random access memory <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight> for the execution. In one embodiment, microcontroller <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight>, flash memory <highlight><bold>656</bold></highlight>, and even random access memory <highlight><bold>658</bold></highlight> may be implemented on a single chip, e.g., a NC68HC05SCXX family chip from Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg, Ill. such as the NC68HC05SC28. Approve button <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> and optional skip button <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> are coupled to microcontroller <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> to permit the user to indicate approval or rejection of a particular transaction displayed using display circuitry <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>. Communication to and from the electronic transaction system is accomplished under control of microcontroller <highlight><bold>654</bold></highlight> via an infrared transceiver <highlight><bold>662</bold></highlight>. Power switch <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> permits the user to power off PEAD <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> when not in use to conserve power and to prevent accidental approval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the approval technique employing the inventive PEAD. In step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, a transaction request is received at the PEAD from the requesting device associated with the electronic transaction system. In step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, the user has the option whether to approve or disapprove the transaction proposed. If not approved, e.g., either by activating the skip button of the PEAD or simply allowing the request to time out, nothing will be done. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if the user approves the proposed transaction, the user may activate the approve button to create transaction approval data. The transaction approval data is then encrypted in step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> within the PEAD. In step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, the encrypted transaction approval data is transmitted to the requesting device of the electronic transaction system after being encrypted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the steps involved in encrypting transaction approval data using public key cryptography. In step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, the transaction approval data package is created. As discussed earlier in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the transaction approval data may be created by appending any necessary user identification data to a portion of or the entire transaction request. Optionally, a time stamp may also be appended thereto. In step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, the transaction approval data is encrypted using the user&apos;s private key, which is preferably kept secured at all times within the PEAD. Thereafter, the encrypted transaction approval data is transmitted back to the electronic transaction system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, it is recognized that even if the encrypted transaction approval data is intercepted and decrypted for analysis by a third party, it is not possible to bypass the security features of the invention as long as the user&apos;s private key or the user identification data is secure. As mentioned earlier, since the user identification data is not accessible externally, it is always secure within the PEAD. This is unlike the prior art wherein the user is required to enter the identification data, e.g., password at the electronic transaction system and risks exposure of this sensitive data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Even if the user identification data is compromised, transaction approval still cannot take place unless there is possession of the user&apos;s private key. It would be useless to intercept the encrypted transaction approval data even if one can decrypt it using the user&apos;s public key since the transaction partner, e.g., the merchant requesting approval of the transaction, will not accept any transaction approval data not encrypted using the user&apos;s private key. Again, since the private key is not accessible externally, it is always secure within the PEAD. This aspect of the invention has great advantages in performing on-line transactions since the user&apos;s private key no longer has to be stored in a vulnerable computer file in a workstation, which may be accessible by other parties and may be difficult to conveniently tote along for other authentication tasks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The fact that the PEAD is implemented in a small, portable package makes it convenient and comfortable for the user to maintain the PEAD within his possession at all times. Even if the PEAD is physically stolen, however, the optional user authentication mechanism, e.g., user authentication mechanism <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, provides an additional level of protection and renders the PEAD useless to all but the properly authenticated user. Of course the user can always notify the issuer of the PEAD if the PEAD is stolen or lost, and the issuer can inform transaction partners to refuse any transaction approval data encrypted with the user&apos;s private key of the stolen PEAD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The fact that the transaction approval data includes the time stamp, the merchant&apos;s name, the amount approved, and any other relevant data also enhances the integrity of the approval process. If the merchant inadvertently or intentionally submits multiple transaction approvals to the issuer, the issuer may be able to recognize from these data items that the submissions are duplicates and ignore any duplicate transaction approval data. For example, the issuer may recognize that it is unlikely for a user to purchase multiple identical dinners at the same restaurant at a given time and date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> It is recognized by the inventor herein that although the PEAD and PEAD-enabled point of sale terminals offer a highly secure system for approving transactions, there exists a well-established and widely available charge card infrastructure, which includes millions of existing charge card point-of-sale terminals (e.g., charge card readers or ATM terminals) in use worldwide. It is further recognized that even in the absence of the PEAD-enabled point of sale terminals, certain PEAD functionality may offer improved transaction security vis-&agrave;-vis the existing charge card infrastructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a portable electronic charge/approval device (PECAD), which not only offer the aforementioned PEAD functionality to permit a user to approve a transaction vis-&agrave;-vis a PEAD-enabled point of sale terminal, but also to permit the user to conduct transactions vis-&agrave;-vis the existing charge card infrastructures. In particular, the complete PECAD system includes a PECAD and an associated emulation card which conforms to current charge card standards as far as its interface with existing charge card readers is concerned. The emulation card can flexibly be configured by the PECAD to appear as an ordinary charge card reader. Together, the PECAD and the emulation card form a secure system for conducting transactions vis-&agrave;-vis the existing charge card infrastructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Note that as the term is employed in the context of this embodiment, charge cards encompass both magnetic-stripe cards and electronic smart cards. The charge cards themselves may represent credit cards (such as Visa or Master Cards), ATM cards, royalty cards, discount cards, as well as any other type of cards which a user may employ vis-&agrave;-vis a point-of-sale terminal to obtain cash, goods, and/or services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Prior to conducting a transaction, the PECAD has in its memory charge card data pertaining to one or more charge cards of the user. To perform the PEAD functionality, the memory may also include other data items discussed earlier in connection with the PEAD. The charge card data may be input in advance from the actual charge cards themselves using the appropriate R/W mechanism of the PECAD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Since the PECAD contains the PEAD functionality, it may of course be employed to approve transactions vis-&agrave;-vis a PEAD-enabled point of sale terminal in the manner earlier discussed in connection with the PEAD. In the absence of a PEAD-enabled point of sale terminal, however, the emulation card is employed instead to conduct the transaction vis-&agrave;-vis the existing charge card infrastructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> To conduct a transaction using the emulation card, the user first request that the PECAD writes charge card data pertaining to a selected charge card to the emulation card. The selected charge card may be selected by the user prior to writing. Since a single emulation card can emulate any number of charge cards, this single emulation card can advantageously replace the multiple charge cards that a user must carry nowadays. Preferably, the user is first properly authenticated, using an appropriate authenticatin mechanism associated with the PECAD, prior to being allowed to use the PECAD to write charge card data to the emulation card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> After the emulation card is written with the charge card data associated with the user-selected charge card, the user may employ the emulation card as if it were a charge card for the purpose of completing the transaction. That is, since the emulation card conforms to the I/O requirements of existing charge cards and charge card readers, it may be read by an existing charge card reader as if it were a charge card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Once the transaction is completed, the user may optionally employ the PECAD to erase the charge card data from the emulation card, thereby rendering the emulation card useless for the purpose of conducting further transactions until the properly authenticated user again authorizes the PECAD to write charge card data onto the emulation card. If the emulation card emulates the electronic smart card, the emulation card may be rendered incapable of use for further transactions by, for example, configuring the registers or flags within the emulation card appropriately. Thus, even if the emulation card is stolen, it is useless to an unauthorized user. Furthermore, even if the emulation card and the PECAD are stolen together, the emulation card itself cannot be written with charge card data unless the user is properly authenticated. This is in sharp contrast to the existing situation wherein, for example, a stolen credit card still contains in its magnetic stripe all the necessary information to conduct a transaction. For further security, the emulation card itself may be physically signed by the properly authorized user and may contain a picture of the authorized user to allow merchants to visually ascertain whether the person conducting the transaction is in fact the rightful owner of the emulation card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, each emulation card is matched, in a substantially unique manner, with a specific PECAD to further enhance security. In this situation, a given PECAD can only write charge card data into the emulation card uniquely associated with it. By way of example, an emulation card may be endowed with appropriate optically encrypted marks (such as holograms), magnetically encrypted marks (such as magnetically stored bits) or mechanically encrypted marks (such as randomly spaced holes) so that it can be written only by a specific PECAD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each emulation card is matched with a single unique PECAD. It should be noted, however, this unique matching aspect is not required to be a mathematical absolute (although such may be preferred). One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that given a sufficiently large number of issued emulation cards and PECAD, some overlap may occur that renders it possible (albeit remotely in real life) that a given emulation card may be recognized by more than one PECAD. In fact, the issuer or manufacturer may posses a master PECAD that is capable of recognizing a number of issued emulation cards. Thus, the association between an emulation card and a PECAD is substantially unique in the sense that a door key is substantially unique to each door lock, not ruling out the potentiality that a manufacturer may choose to make an emulation card absolutely unique relative to a given PECAD or the remote possibility that in the millions of door locks manufactured, a given key may open more than one door lock. Preferably, the encrypted marks and geographic distribution pattern of the emulation cards/PECADs (e.g., within the same city or state) be arranged that such remote possibility is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Because each emulation is substantially uniquely matched with a specific PECAD, even if a PECAD is stolen and the authentication mechanism is successfully bypassed by a person intending to commit fraud, the stolen PECAD still cannot be used to write charge card data into any arbitrary blank emulation card for the purpose of conducting fraudulent transactions. As a further advantage, the requirement that a given PECAD can only write (after proper authentication) to the emulation card substantially uniquely associated with it substantially eliminates the accidental overwriting of an existing charge card by the PECAD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a simplified block diagram of PECAD <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> memory <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is preferably nonvolatile, tamper-proof memory and serves the same function as the memory circuit in the PEAD, except that memory <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> may also be employed to store the encrypted charge card data pertaining to one or more charge cards of the user. Encryption logic <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> performs the same encryption/decryption/security function as the encryption logic discussed in connection with the PEAD. That is, access to data stored in memory <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, including the user&apos;s private key, the user&apos;s personal data, and the charge card data, is preferably facilitated only through encryption logic <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Authentication mechanism <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> performs the same user authentication function discussed in connection with the PEAD. I/O circuitry <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> represents the circuitry that permits the PECAD to communicate with a PEAD-enabled point of sale terminal if it is available for the purpose of approving transactions. The transaction approval aspect has been discussed earlier in connection with the PEAD and will not be belabored here. I/O circuitry <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> may be omitted on certain PECAD models if it is expected that such PECAD models do not communicate with a PEAD point of sale terminal and are employed only to configure emulation cards for the purpose of conducting transactions vis-&agrave;-vis the existing charge card infrastructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Card R/W mechanism <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> represents the mechanism employed to write selected charge card data to the emulation card and to erase the emulation card after the transaction is completed. If the charge card data is acquired by reading in existing charge cards, card R/W mechanism <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> also includes the ability to read in existing charge cards for the purpose of storing the charge card data to memory <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> (through encryption logic <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>). Note that data read through card R/W mechanism <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> is encrypted by encryption logic <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> prior to being stored within memory <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. Likewise, stored data (such as charge card data) in memory <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> is first decrypted by encryption logic <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> prior to being written to an emulation card via card R/W mechanism <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a simplified sketch of a PECAD <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, including an emulation card <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> disposed therein. Emulation card <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> is removable from slot <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> for the purpose of completing transactions vis-&agrave;-vis an existing charge card reader. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, emulation card <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> includes a magnetic stripe <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> to emulate a magnetic stripe charge card. As mentioned earlier, however, emulation card <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> may be configured to emulate any type of charge card interface, including IC contacts. A card R/W mechanism <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is shown in an outline format to indicate that it is part of PECAD <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. Through card R/W mechanism <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, data may be read from an existing charge card or written to an emulation card. Key pads <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> can be used as authentication mechanism as described as in <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> as well as <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. User can key in the password or PIN to activate the PECAD to write the charge card data to the emulation card <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Approve button <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to approve button <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A and may be employed to approve a transaction via a PEAD-enabled point of sale terminal. Card button <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight> on the other hand on the other hand indicates the user&apos;s desire to complete the transaction via the emulation card. Card selector buttons <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) are exemplary selections which may be chosen by the user to select the specific charge card that may be employed to conduct the transaction. A display <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> may be employed to display the charge card data, such as charge card number, expiration date, name of holder, etc. of the selected charge card to allow a merchant to copy such information, if desired, to complete the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, transaction security is further enhanced by using the PECAD to write an encrypted transaction number or other encrypted data that has been encrypted using the user&apos;s private key (which is stored in secure nonvolatile memory of the PECAD) to the emulation card. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates, in accordance with one embodiment, this aspect of the present invention. In step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, a unique transaction number is generated and encrypted with the user&apos;s private key for each transaction. In step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, the encrypted transaction number is written from the PECAD to the emulation card. If the emulation card emulates a magnetic stripe card, for example, the encrypted transaction number may be written to one of the existing but unused tracks or one of he reserve tracks, e.g., track <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the magnetic stripe. In step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, software in the charge card reader may instruct the charge card reader to receive the encrypted transaction number which is then authenticated using a user&apos;s public key that has been obtained form a credentialed third party (step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>); or in step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, the charge card reader reads in the encrypted transaction number, which is then sent to the credit clearance center such as Master Card or Visa Card and the credit clearance center would authenticate the user by using a user&apos;s public key that has been obtained from a credentialed third party (step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>). Typically some form of user identification may be sent to the credentialed third party to facilitate obtaining the public key. By way of example, the user ID or the public key ID may be read by the charge card reader and transmitted to the credentialed third party to obtain the public key. The public key ID may represent, for example, the unique pattern of bits in the public key (e.g., the lowest 32 bits or 64 bits) that may be transmitted to the receiving site for public key searching and decryption. If authenticated, the transaction is then approved, enabling the merchant to release the goods/service to the user (step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated from the foregoing, the invention requires substantially no hardware change to the existing charge card readers and the existing charge card infrastructure. The change merely relates to software change, which instructs the existing charge card reader to read in the encrypted transaction number and which authenticates the encrypted transaction number using a user&apos;s public key obtained from a credentialed third party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Further, there may be no change at all in the charge card reader. Instead, the credit clearance center software may be notified to authenticate the encrypted transaction number using the user&apos;s public key obtained from the credentialed third party. The charge card reader just read in all the data from the charge card or emulation card and verbatimly send all the information to the credit clearance center for approval. In this manner, this embodiment minimizes the changes that need to be made to the existing charge card infrastructure (i.e., changes only have to be made at a single location in the credit clearance center, and not in the millions of charge card readers in existence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> If additional security is desired, the user may key in at the PECAD the transaction amount and/or the time of the transaction. These pieces of data may also be encrypted using the user&apos;s private key and written to the emulation card to be received by the chrge card reader and decrypted at the credit clearance center using the user&apos;s public key, which is again preferably obtained from a credentialed third party. In this case, approval of the transaction is given only if the transaction is for the amount indicated in the encrypted and received transaction amount and/or if the transaction occurs within a predefined time period of the encrypted and received transaction time (which was written from the PECAD to the emulation card previously). Thus, even if the emulation card is stolen, it is useless for other subsequent transactions, even if erasure or reconfiguration of the emulation card did occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In the internet transaction, a user can approve the transaction using PEAD or PECAD by encrypting the amount he approved using his own private key stored in the PEAD or PECAD. Thereafter, he can copy the encrypted information displayed on the PEAD display <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> or PECAD display <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is preferably in a human readable format such as in alpha numeric string to render it simple for the user to read and manually enter (by for example keying in or by speech command) to the computer connected through the Internet to conduct the Internet transaction. If necessary, one can also encrypt the credit card number together with the transaction information using the PEAD or PECAD to conduct secure Internet transactions. Of course the manual entering/keying technique, which desirable for backward compatibility, may be equally substituted by other forms of data entry, e.g., wireless or infrared communication via an appropriate port in the computer and PECAD (or PEAD) to allow data to be transmitted over the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As mentioned earlier, it is preferable that authentication of the user&apos;s identity be ascertained using the user&apos;s public key that is kept by a credentialed third party. The credentialed third party may represent, for example, any entity in which the public has a fairly high level of trust, such as an organization known to have or has a self-interest to have a trustworthy reputation. Examples include government organizations, banks, large corporations, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The credentialed party maintains a PECAD public key directory service that associates the list of manufacturer-provided public keys with users. When the user first acquires (via purchase or issuance by an issuer, for example) a PECAD, the user can register his ownership of the PECAD with the credentialed third party. Depending on the integrity of the registration process, the user is assigned a validation level, which indicated the degree of confidence that the person completing the registration is in fact who he says he is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> By way of example, the user may register simply by furnishing via email, phone, or regular mail personal information such as social security number, home address and home phone number, along with the PECAD serial number and public key signature (which is a unique sequence of numbers assigned by the manufacturer to a particular PECAD and which can be read from the PECAD by pressing a designated sequence of keys). The PECAD public key directory center may then user the PECAD serial number provided by the user as the unique searching ID to search for the Public Key in the database, once it finds the Public Key and it will use the Public Key signature provided by the user to verify against the Public Key in the database. If the verification is successful, then the user may be registered. Otherwise the user will be rejected. The public key is preferably unique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The more secure way to register a user&apos;s ownership may be as follows (the process usually occurs at the place of purchase of the PECAD/PEAD or at the issuer, e.g., a bank). The issuer first activates the PEAD/PECAD using the manufacturer-provided password. Thereafter, the PEAD/PECAD user may overwrite the manufacturer-provided password with the user&apos;s password or other authentication mechanism(s). The user may then instruct the PEAD/PECAD to internally generate a new pair of private/public key (called user private key and user public key) inside the PEAD/PECAD. The user may also instruct the PEAD/PECAD to encrypt the personal information (such as social security information, home address, etc.) and the new user public key using the manufacturer-provided private key, which is pre-stored in the PEAD/PECAD to generate the user registration message. This manufacturer-provided private/public key pair may be generated by the PEAD/PECAD when the PEAD/PECAD is manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The issuer may then encrypt the PEAD/PECAD serial number and user registration message using the public key directory service center&apos;s public key to generate the registration message and transmit the registration message to the public key directory service center. Upon receiving the registration message, the public key directory service center may then decrypt the registration message using its own private key. Thereafter, the public key directory service center may use the PEAD/PECAD serial number to search for the manufacturer-provided key found in the database. If the decryption is successful, then update the manufacturer-provided public key with the new user public key in the directory service database and update the personal information in the directory service database and generate the public key ID using, for example, the person name&plus;phone number or the lowest 32-bit (or 64 bit) of the public key for future referencing purposes. On the other hand, if decryption is unsuccessful, the user may then be rejected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> This registration process is generally accorded a low validation level since it is possible that someone other than the user may have fraudulently obtained the user&apos;s personal information for the purpose of registering ownership (and making the user responsible for the fraudulent charges that follow once registration is completed and the PECAD is activated). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> An intermediate validation level may be obtained by furnishing, in addition to the information provided to acquire a low validation level, information which offers a higher degree of confidence that the person furnishing the information is indeed who he says he is. By way of example, the addition information may take the form of a photograph, signature, notary public&apos;s seal, or a combination of the above. A high validation level may be obtained by furnishing information which offers an even higher degree of confidence that the person furnishing the information is indeed who he says he is. By way of example, the registrant may appear in person at the PECAD public key directory center to present a photograph, a signature, a biometrics sample (such as fingerprint, retina scan, DNA print, or the like) or a combination of the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Once registration is completed, the PECAD public key directory by the credentialed third party may be consulted by credit clearance centers or merchants for the purpose of authenticating the user and approving transactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The PECAD public key directory may also be enhanced by establishing an insurance policy that protects merchants or credit clearance centers from financial loss due to, for example, fraud stemming from a defective registration process. The coverage provided by the insurance policy may be scaled according to the validation level, with the higher validation levels being eligible for a higher amount of coverage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in terms of several preferred embodiments, there are alteration, permutations, and equivalents which fall within the scope of this invention. It should also be noted that there are many alternative ways of implementing the methods and apparatuses of the present invention. By wat of example, while the discussion herein has focused on transaction approvals, it should be apparent to those skilled that the PEAD may be employed to conduct any kind of transaction vis-&agrave;-vis an electronic transactions system any time secured data transmission from the user to the electronic transaction system is preferred. For example, the PEAD may be employed for logging into highly sensitive computer systems or facilities. When so implemented, the computer terminal with which the PEAD communicates may be equipped with an infrared port, a magnetic reader port, or a contact-type plug for communication with the PEAD. The user may then employ the PEAD to perform any type of authentication tasks online. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> As a further example, the PEAD may be employed to &ldquo;sign&rdquo; any computer file for authentication purposes (e.g., to authenticate the date or the user). The transaction approval data may then be saved along with the file to be authenticated for future reference. Note that the transaction authentication data is again tamper-proof since any transaction authentication data not encrypted using the user&apos;s private key will not be accepted as authentic. Also, it should be apparent that if the PEAD is employed to approve only predefined transactions, the transaction data may be stored in advance within the PEAD and do not need to be received from externally by the PEAD. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims be interpreted as including all such alterations, permutations, and equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
