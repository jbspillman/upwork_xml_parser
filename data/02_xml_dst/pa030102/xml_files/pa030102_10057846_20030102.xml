<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to assays for agents that affect cellular invasions and the use of agents that inhibit cellular invasions or angiogenesis in the treatment of disease. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cell motility and invasion are essential physiological processes in tissue development and homeostasis, including embryogenesis, angiogenesis, wound healing, ovulation, embryo implantation and pregnancy, immune surveillance and inflammation. They are also key factors in many pathological processes such as inflammation, atherosclerosis, restenosis, glaucoma, retinopathies, myocardial ischemia, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and tumour progression and metastasis. For example, the process of tumour metastasis begins with the dissemination of cells from the primary tumour followed by the movement of cells through the stromal compartment of the organ in which the primary tumour is located, intravasation of the tumour cells from vascular/lymphatic bed within distant, secondary organ of metastasis, and the movement of tumour cells into the tissues of the secondary organ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Inhibition of cell motility and invasion would be useful for the treatment of cancer, and other disorders involving cell motility and invasion including those listed above, as well as for contraception. For example, cancer cell invasion driven by altered interactions between cells and an extracellular matrix (ECM). In the case of epithelial-derived carcinomas, the primary tumour is surrounded by a specialized ECM, the basement membrane. Tissue culture procedures which utilize reconstituted basement membrane matrices have been used to demonstrate that changes in matrix deposition, matrix degradation, cellular attachment to the matrix and migration through the matrix play a role in carcinoma cell invasion (Wyke, J. A. (2000) Eur. J. Cancer, 36:1589-1594). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Previous methods for determining whether an agent has an effect on cellular invasion rely on the use of a biological matrix and involve detection of a change in cell penetration or migration through such a matrix. In particular, such methods have involved measuring a decrease in the number of cells (or the absence of cells) which penetrate or migrate trough a matrix upon application of an agent. Such methods are suitable for use in situations where information related to the agent&apos;s cytotoxicity or ability to affect a cell&apos;s attachment to the biological matrix is known, but are not generally suitable for use in screening procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Angiogenesis inhibition presents a cancer treatment strategy because avascular tumours are incapable of growth and have little metastatic potential. Antiangiogenic compounds that have been evaluated for treatment of solid tumours include small molecules that inhibit metalloproteinases, ion channels, protein kinases, or cell proliferation; agents that inactivate or antagonize growth factors; and agents whose mechanism of action is still unknown. Discovery of new antiangiogenic agents is desirable for the development of therapies for cancer and other diseases. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the testing method of this invention, invasive cells are placed on the surface of a biological matrix. For purposes of this invention, invasive cells are any cells able to move through a biological membrane or a gel made of extracellular matrix materials or other materials compatible with cell survival. Suitable cells include any invasive cancer cells such as those described in the examples below or other cells such as PC-3 prostate carcinoma, U-87 glioma, and U-251 glioma, as well as non-cancerous cells such as neuronal cells, endothelial cells, nucleated hemopoietic cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> For purposes of this invention, a biological matrix may be a membrane or a gel made of extracellular matrix materials or other materials compatible with cell survival into which invasive cells are capable of invading. Examples include the biological matrix employed in the examples below as well as other gels such as fibrin gels, or gels formed or individual extracellular matrix components or mixtures of extracellular components, or gels formed of any substance that is compatible with cell survival, or gels containing any substances that are compatible with cell survival. Suitable biological matrices include those used to date to assess the invasive qualities of cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the testing method of this invention, invasive cells are maintained on the surface of a biological matrix for a time sufficient for the cells to invade the matrix. The time may be determined by the person of skill in the art based on the type of cells employed and the nature of the matrix. Once sufficient time has elapsed for the cells to invade the matrix, substantially all cells are removed from the surface of the matrix. This may be done using any suitable means known in the art, including those described in the examples below. The removed cells are transferred to a surface upon which the cells are capable of attachment and proliferation. Such a surface may be any surface known in the art that is compatible with the cells employed in the testing method and include the plastic surfaces described herein. The cells are maintained on the surface for a time sufficient for the cells to attach and proliferate on the surface. The amount of time will be selected by the practitioner according to the type of cell and nature of the surface in order that a sufficient amount of time will lapse such that cells that have attached to the surface and are alive will have proliferated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the testing method of this invention, a value is determined indicative of the number or quantity of cells that are attached to the surface and have proliferated. Various means known in the art may be used for determining this value including means for directly counting the number of cells, as well as indirect means such as the assay procedures described herein. Other procedures include the MTS, neutral red, radioactive thymidine incorporation assays as well as others capable of measuring the quantity or numbers of live cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Compounds of this invention or for use in this invention, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be obtained by synthesis according to the previously known procedures as described above or as exemplified herein. Some compounds that may be used in this invention can be obtained from natural sources, such as is disclosed in the prior art and in the examples herein. Such naturally occurring motuporamines may be modified according to methodology known in the art and as specifically exemplified herein. Compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention and for use in this invention will be in substantially purified form. By &ldquo;substantially purified formula&rdquo;, it is meant that the compound or salt (if naturally occurring), is present substantially free of cells of a source organism or tissue. The term &ldquo;substantially free of cellular contaminants&rdquo; means that the compound is present ex vivo and in a concentration greater than that of the compound in a source organism, tissue, or other natural source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The synthesis schemes shown in Table 1 generally outline reactions that may be used to prepare motuporamine compounds and analogs thereof for use in this invention. Examples of use of such schemes for preparation of specific compounds is described in the examples which follow.

<heading lvl="1">A. SCREENING FOR INHIBITORS OF CELLULAR INVASION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Matrigel&trade; is an extract of the transplantable Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine sarcoma that is rich in laminin, collagen IV, entactin and heparin sulphate proteoglygen. At 4&deg; C. Matrigel is liquid, but at 37&deg; C. it polymerizes in a cation-dependent manner to form a semisolid gel. These physical properties have been exploited to develop two widely used cellular invasion procedures. In the &ldquo;outgrowth&rdquo; procedure, cells are suspended in liquid Matrigel followed by gelling. Invasion is then monitored morphologically as the cells form outgrowths into the gel (Bae, S. N., et al. (1993) Breast Cancer Res. Treat, 24:241-255). In the &ldquo;Boyden chamber&rdquo; procedure, Matrigel is pre-gelled upon a porous filter support. Cells are then placed on the Matrigel and invasion is quantified by determining the number of cells that cross to the other side of the basement membrane/filter barrier, usually in response to a chemotactic agent (Price, J. T. and Thompson, E. W. (1999) Meth. Mol. Biol. 129:231-250). The deficiency in the &ldquo;outgrowth&rdquo; procedure is the need to visually monitor changes in cell morphology. The &ldquo;Boyden chamber&rdquo; procedure generates quantitative data, but like the &ldquo;outgrowth&rdquo; procedure it is unable to discriminate between agents that affect invasion and cell viability or cell adhesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The inventors herein have recognized that a significant proportion of crude biological extracts cause cell death because of the high concentrations of salt and other toxic molecules present in many extracts. However, the assay of this invention is quantitative and eliminates those agents that prevent cell adhesion or which are cytotoxic. The assay of this invention scores a &ldquo;positive&rdquo; hit for cells that remain attached to the matrix, show a decrease in invasion and remain viable from the beginning to end of the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The MDA 231 human breast carcinoma cell line is highly invasive and metastatic, These cells attach to Matrigel within 15 min and begin to invade and migrate into the reconstituted basement membrane matrix within 2-4 hours in a manner that can be assessed morphologically. In contrast, MDA 453 human breast cancer cells are much less metastatic and while they rapidly attach to Matrigel, they do not invade the matrix within 4 hours. Differential invasive properties between the two cells lines such as these may be used to develop optimal conditions for recovery of non-invasive cells in the method of this invention. In this example, recovery of the less invasive MDA 453 cell line was greater than 5 fold the recovery of the more invasive MDA 231 line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Suitability of the assay of this invention was tested in drug screening using a selection of crude extracts from marine sponges. 230 extracts were tested at 50-100 &mgr;g/ml. 228 extracts showed readings close to or below those of negative controls containing dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (0.025). However, two extracts showed strong activity, higher than a positive control using LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-linase inhibitor known to inhibit invasion. The active compounds were purified from the first extract, as described below using the assay to guide fractionation. The second active extract resembled the first one morphologically and its extract was determined to contain the same active compounds. The active compounds were identified as motuporamines, a family of macrocyclic alkaloids with a spermidine-like substructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Cell Culture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Human breast carcinoma MDA 231 and MDA 453 cells obtained from the American type culture collection (Bethesda Md.) and were cultured in a 1:1 (v:v) mixture of Dulbecco&apos;s modified Eagle medium and F12 culture medium (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin (5 &mgr;g/ml) and gentamycin (50 U/ml). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated by flushing fresh umbilical cord veins with 50 ml Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium followed by 20 ml collagenase A in RPMI (0.13 mg/ml). The cords were then filled with collagenase A and incubated at rt for 30 min. After massaging the cords to dislodge cells, the contents were flushed with 30 ml RPMI, harvested and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed with RPMI and suspended in medium complete with trace elements (MCDB) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10% iron-supplemented fetal calf serum, 16 U/ml heparin, 20 &mgr;g/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS), 2 mM glutamine and 100 U/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. For the initial passage, cells were plated onto dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin to promote HUVEC attachment. Subsequent passages were performed using standard tissue culture treated dishes. All cells were maintained at 37&deg; C. in 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Marine Organism Collection and Extract Preparation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Approximately 250 g each of marine sponges were collected by hand from tropical Pacific Ocean reefs at a depth of about 15 m off Motupore and Madang in Papua New Guinea. Samples were deep frozen on site and transported over dry ice. Voucher samples of each were kept in methanol at &minus;20&deg; C. at The University of British Columbia, Canada, for taxonomic identification. Samples of <highlight><italic>Xestospongia. exigua </italic></highlight>were deposited at the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam (ZMA POR 11521). Extracts were prepared by homogenizing 200 g of each sponge sample in methanol. The homogenates were filtered and concentrated under vacuum to give a gummy residue. About 1 mg was dissolved in 100 &mgr;l DMSO and used in the invasion inhibitor assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Assay for Invasion Inhibitors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, Mass.) was diluted 1:1 in ice-cold DMEM/F12 and 50 &mgr;l was pipetted into wells of ice-cold 96-well cell culture plates (Falcon) using ice-cold pipette tips, avoiding the sides of each well. The matrix was then allowed to gel and then dry overnight in a dry 37&deg; C. incubator followed by rehydration with 100 &mgr;l of growth medium 1 h prior to cell plating. This treatment produces a matrix that is less prone to breakage. On top of the Matrigel, was added 100 &mgr;l medium warmed to 37&deg; C., with or without 1 &mgr;l of sponge extract dissolved in DMSO, followed by 100 &mgr;l medium containing 60.000 MDA 231 cells. Addition of 1 &mgr;l of DMSO served as a negative control. 50 &mgr;M &mgr;M LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor known to inhibit invasion, served as a positive control. The cells were then incubated for 2.5 h to allow invasion to take place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> After incubation, cells had either invaded the Matrigel or failed to invade and settled on the surface of the Matrigel. Most of the cell culture medium was removed without disturbing the cells. This may be accomplished using a hand-held pipettor, but more consistent results are achieved using the aspiration function of a Bio-Tek Elx405 96-well plate washer with the aspiration needle positioned about 2 mm above the surface of the Matrigel. The cells that failed to invade were recovered by detaching them from the surface of the Matrigel by incubation with 200 &mgr;l of 0.125% trypsin in Hank&apos;s Balanced Sit Solution for 30 min at 37&deg; C. This enzymatic treatment detaches cells that are attached to the upper surface of the Matrigel but it does not degrade the matrix and does not release cells that have invaded the gel. The cells were then suspended by pipetting up and down three times using the 100 &mgr;l setting of a hand-held pipettor, and 100 &mgr;l was withdrawn and transferred to fresh plates without Matrigel containing 100 &mgr;l medium supplemented with 30% fetal calf serum to inactivate the trypsin. The cells were then incubated overnight to allow attachment of cells to the plastic surface. Live cells were measured using the MTT assay: the cell culture medium was replaced with 100 &mgr;l fresh medium and 25 &mgr;l of a 5 mg/ml solution of 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide in phosphate-buffered saline. After 2 hr at 37&deg; C., the solution was removed and 100 &mgr;l of 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate dissolved in dimethylformamide: water (1:1) was added to lyse the cells. After overnight incubation at 37&deg; C., absorbance was measured at 570 min. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Low and high resolution FABMS were recorded on a Kratos Concept II HQ mass spectrometer with xenon as the bombarding gas and a thioglycerol sample matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Merck Type 5554 silica gel plates and Whatman MKC18F plates were used for analytical thin layer chromatography. Reversed-phase HPLC purifications were performed on a Waters 600E System Controller attached to a Waters 410 Differential Refractometer. All solvents used for HPLC were Fisher HPLC grade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Isolation of Motuporamines </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A portion of a frozen specimen of <highlight><italic>Xestospongia exigua </italic></highlight>(86 g) was cut into small pieces, immersed in and subsequently extracted repeatedly with methanol (3&times;150 ml). The combined methanolic extracts were concentrated under vacuum and then partitioned between ethyl acetate (3&times;70 ml) and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (200 ml). The aqueous layer, which exhibited activity in the invasion assay, was next extracted with n-butanol (3&times;70 ml). The combined butanol extracts were concentrated under vacuum to yield 1.16 g of brown oil. The active n-butanol soluble material was separated by repeated chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 eluting first with methanol (yielding 118.4 mg of active material) as the eluent and then 20:5:2 ethyl acetate/methanol/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O to give 55.6 mg of a pale amorphous solid that stained with ninhydrin and was active in the invasion assay. The amorphous solid consisted of a single class of compounds with a spermidine-like substructure, comprising the known Motuporamines A-C and several new motuporamines. Motuporamine C was the major component (&gt;90%) in the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The compounds were separated at high dilution (&lt;0.1 mg per injection) on reversed-phase HPLC using a Whatman Magnum-9 Partisil 10 ODS-3 column, with 2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 11:9 methanol/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O as the eluent. This HPLC fractionation gave a pure sample of Motuporamine A, a fraction containing a mixture of B and D (consisting of at least 4 methyl branched analogs), a pure sample of Motuporamine C, a fraction containing &gt;90% Motuporamine E, plus two other olefins isomeric with E, and a pure sample of acetylmotuporamine C and trifluoracetylmotuporamine C which may both be artifacts of isolation. Except for Motuporamine C, all other compounds were isolated in sub-mg quantities. All of the motuporamines isolated were the ammonium TFA/water salts. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Different concentrations of Motuporamine A, Motuporamine B. Motuporamine C, a mixture of the B and D forms and a mixture of Motuporamine G, H, and I, were tested in the invasion inhibition assay. All inhibited invasion. Motuporamine C (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;1 &mgr;m; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), Motuporamine A (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;3 &mgr;M; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the B and D mixture (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;3 &mgr;M; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), Motuporamine B and the G, H, I mixture showed similar activity. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also show inhibition by various compounds of his invention. The IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>values for the compounds shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> were from about 1-10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Low Cytotoxicity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The cytotoxic effects of Motuporamine C were examined by incubating cells in the presence of different concentrations of the compound for 24 h. Motuporamine C was washed away and cell proliferation was measured for up to 5 additional days. Motuporamine C at a concentration close to the IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>for invasion inhibition (1.6 &mgr;M), had no detectable effects on cell proliferation. Higher concentrations of 4 and 8 &mgr;M showed mild inhibition of cell proliferation. Therefore, Motuporamine C shows little or no toxicity towards proliferating MDA 231 cells at the low micromolar concentrations at which it inhibits invasion. Likewise, the compounds shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> have low cytotoxicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Activity of Motuporamine Analogs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> A conspicuous feature of motuporamines is their spermidine-like tail, which is positively charged at physiological pH. Synthetic and semisynthetic motuporamine analogs were prepared and tested at different concentrations in the invasion inhibition assay. A motuporamine A analog lacking the spermidine-like tail was completely inactive (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The terminal amino group of Motuporamine C was acetylated (monoacetylated Motuporamine C; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) or substituted with trifluoroacetate (CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Ac Motuporamine C; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Both compounds were highly active, showing that a charged amino group is not required at this position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The number of carbons between the nitrogens of the tail was varied. A compound with only two carbons adjacent the terminal amino group showed strong activity (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) and a compound with four carbons instead of three also showed strong activity (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). A compound with only two carbons instead of three adjacent the ring (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) is active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> A second feature of the naturally occurring motuporamines is the simple 13-15 membered ring. Analysis showed that Motuporamine C with a 15-membered ring is slightly more active than the 14-membered Motuporamine E and the 13-membered Motuporamine A. A series of synthetic analogs with different ring sizes were prepared and tested for invasion inhibition. A compound containing a 5-membered ting and a compound with a 6-membered ring coupled to the spermidine-like tail showed no activity. A compound having a fully unsaturated, multiple ring structure demonstrated potent activity (carbazole analog; IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;3 &mgr;M; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Motuporamines Inhibit Cancer Cell Spreading </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> MDA 231 cells are highly invasive. They rapidly attach to the Matrigel and within 4 hours have taken on a fusiform morphology and have migrated into the gel. Incubation of cells with Motuporamine C prevents the formation of invasive, fusiform cells on Matrigel. The motuporamine concentration that completely inhibited invasion (5 &mgr;M) did not cause the cells to detach from the matrix. Rather, the cells remained attached but were rounded, sitting on top of the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The observation that Motuporamine C caused MDA 231 cells to remain rounded on Matrigel suggested inhibition of cell spreading. The cells were plated on rigid tissue culture plastic in the presence of serum, which contains spreading factors (Ham). Under these conditions, most MDA 231 cells spread on the plastic within 4 h in the absence of Motuporamine C. The spreading cells displayed large, flattened lamellae with prominent, continuous ruffling edges. These ruffles, which appear black in phase contrast microscopy represent sites of dynamic actin-mediated membrane movement in both spreading and migrating cells. Increasing doses of Motuporamine C decreased cell spreading with most cells appearing rounded at 5 &mgr;M. These rounded cells remained attached to the tissue culture plastic by small lamellae that had small, discontinuous ruffles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> MDA 231 cells were also pre-spread for 20 hours on tissue culture plastic and then treated with Motuporamine C (5 &mgr;M) for 4 hours. Phase contrast microscopy revealed that the cells became slightly refractile, indicative of slight retraction, but did not round-up. As determined by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin, treatment with Motuporamine C causes subtle changes to the actin cytoskeleton: actin stress fibers are still visible but there are often small discrete &ldquo;buttons&rdquo; of actin localization at cell edges in place of continuous raffles. In contrast, treatment with the f-actin disrupting agent cytochalasin D (CD; 1 &mgr;g/ml) causes the cells to round up completely and causes complete disassembly of the actin filaments. Treatment of cells with Motuporamine C for up to 48 hours did not cause significant cell rounding of the cells already attached and spread on the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Motuporamines Inhibit Cancer Cell Migration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The effects of Motuporamine C on cell spreading and actin ruffling indicates invasion inhibition by decreasing cell migration. A sterile toothpick was drawn across a confluent monolayer of MDA 231 cells, leaving a cell-free gap of about 100 &mgr;m. Closure of the gap by cell migration was monitored by microscopy. In the absence of Motuporamine C, cells migrated into the gap and essentially closed it within 24 hours. These cells had broad lamellar ruffles along their leading edges throughout which were condensations of actin. In contrast, there was still a considerable gap present at 24 hours when cells were exposed to Motuporamine C (5 &mgr;M), indicating that Motuporamine C slows cell migration. These cells had only small and discontinuous ruffles along their leading edges and contained only small discrete patches of actin, looking similar to the &ldquo;button-like&rdquo; condensations observed in pre-spread cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Endothelial sprouting was assessed by a modification of Nehls, V. and Drenckham, D. (1995) Microvasc. Res. 50:311-322). Microcarrier beads coated with denatured collagen (Cytodex 3, Sigma) were seeded with HUVEC. When the cells reached confluence on the beads, equal numbers of HUVEC-coated beads were embedded in fibrin gels in 96-well plates. For preparation of fibrin gels, bovine fibrinogen was dissolved in MCDB medium at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Aprotinin was added at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml and the solution was filtered through a 0.22 &mgr;m filter. The fibrinogen solution was supplemented with 15 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with or without Motuporamine C. As a control, fibrinogen solution without VEGF or Motuporamine C was used. Following transfer of the fibrinogen solution to 96-well plates, HUVEC-coated beads were added at a density of 50 beads per well and clotting was induced by the addition of thrombin (1.2 U/ml). After clotting was complete, gels were equilibrated with MCDB medium containing 5% fetal calf serum at 37&deg; C. After 60 min of incubation, the medium was replaced with the same medium with or without Motuporamine C. After 3 days of incubation with daily changes of the medium, the number of capillary-like tubes formed per microcarrier bead (sprouts/bead) was counted by microscopy. Only sprouts greater than 150 &mgr;m in length and composed of at least 3 endothelial cells were counted. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs were incubated at 37&deg; C. under conditions of constant humidity. On embryonic day 6, the developing chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was separated from the shell by opening a small circular window at the broad end of the egg above the air sac. After removal of the inner membrane, the opening was sealed with Parafilm and the eggs were incubated for 2 more days. Motuporamine C was prepared in PBS supplemented with 30 ng/ml VEGF. On day 8, 20 &mgr;l was loaded onto 2 mm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>gelatin sponges (Gelfoam, Pharmacia Upjohn) that were placed on the surface of the developing CAM. Sponges containing vehicle alone (20 &mgr;l PBS) were used as negative controls whereas sponges containing 20 &mgr;l of 30 ng/ml VEGF in PBS were used as positive controls. Eggs were resealed and returned to the incubator. On day 10, images of CAM were captured digitally using an Olympus SZX9 stereomicroscope equipped with a Sport RT digital imaging system (Diagnostics Instruments). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Motuporamine C inhibits angiogenesis as shown in the in vitro endothelial sprouting assay and in the in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. In the endothelial sprouting assay, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) are seeded onto collagen-coated beads. Exposure to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates the formation of capillary-like tubes called sprouts, whose number and length may be measured over time by microscopy. In this assay 2.5 &mgr;M Motuporamine C showed clear inhibition of sprout formation in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 15 ng/ml). AT 5 &mgr;M, Motuporamine C showed complete inhibition of sprouting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Motuporamine C had no effect on survival of confluent HUVEC at concentrations up to 10 &mgr;M and for up to 72 hours. Also, Motuporamine C does not decrease the proliferation rate of HUVEC and may enhance proliferation of HUVEC slightly. Therefore, Motuporamine C does not inhibit angiogenesis through toxic or antiproliferative effects. Rather, Motuporamine C inhibited HUVEC migration as assessed using a modified Boyden chamber assay. The compound inhibited the migration of HUVEC towards the VEGF (15 ng/ml) at both 2.5 &mgr;M and 5 &mgr;M. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Motuporamine C administered (i.p.) daily to mice bearing Lewis Lung and SCCVII tumours at a dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day caused a significant decrease in tumour growth compared to vehicle dosed control animals. Drug administration started when tumours were 50-200 mm3 in volume and resulted in a 25-50% reduction in tumour growth rate compared to controls. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Motuporamine C administered (i.p.) at 15 mg/kg/day to C57 mice implanted with a primary Lewis lung tumour showed a decreased incidence of lung metastases compared to vehicle treated control animals. Primary tumours were grown to a specific size and then irradiated permitting the animals to survive long enough for lung metastases to be quantified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Motuporamine Inhibit Neuronal Migration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Synthetic dihydromotuporamine (DiH-MPC, 5 &mgr;M) affected neuronal migration in a well-characterized insect embryo model. DiH-MPC slowed stereotypical migration of axonal growth cones whose ultimate synaptic targets are in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, there were no steering or pathfinding deficits; only the rate of nerve growth cone migration at the ends of the developing axons was inhibited. Therefore, the motuporamines have application in situations where reduced axonal sprouting would be of benefit after CNS wounding. This is of particular interest in spinal cord lesions where wound-induced axonal sprouting and migration (i.e. plasticity) leads to the inappropriate intermingling of neuronal pathways, which is a major impediment to clinically efficacious CNS regeneration. </paragraph>
