<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to preparation of microparticles containing an active agent More particularly, the present invention relates to microparticles having a selected release profile for release of the active agent from the microparticles, and to a method for the preparation of such microparticles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods is known by which compounds can be encapuslated in the form of microparticles. It is particularly advantageous to encapsulate a biologically active or pharmaceutically active agent within a biocompatible, biodegradable wall-forming material (e.g., a polymer) to provide sustained or delayed release of drugs or other active agents. In these methods, the material to be encapsulated (drugs or other active agents) is generally dissolved, dispersed, or emulsified in a solvent containing the wall forming material. Solvent is then removed from the microparticles to form the finished microparticle product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An example of a conventional microencapsulation process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,737,337 wherein a solution of a wall or shell forming polymeric material in a solvent is prepared. The solvent is only partially miscible in water. A solid or core material is dissolved or dispersed in the polymer-containing solution and, thereafter, the core-material-polymer-containing solution is dispersed in an aqueous liquid that is immiscible in the organic solvent in order to remove solvent from the microparticles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Tice et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,389,330 describe the preparation of microparticles containing an active agent by using a two-step solvent removal process. In the Tice et al. process, the active agent and the polymer are dissolved in a solvent. The mixture of ingredients in the solvent is then emulsified in a continuous-phase processing medium that is immiscible with the solvent. A dispersion of microparticles containing the indicated ingredients is formed in the continuous-phase medium by mechanical agitation of the mixed materials. From this dispersion, the organic solvent can be partially removed in the first step of the solvent removal process. After the first stage, the dispersed microparticles are isolated from the continuous-phase processing medium by any convenient means of separation. Following the isolation, the remainder of the solvent in the microparticles is removed by extraction. After the remainder of the solvent has been removed from the microparticles, they are dried by exposure to air or by other conventional drying techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another conventional method of microencapsulating an agent to form a microencapsulated product is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,407,609. This method includes: (1) dissolving or otherwise dispersing one or more agents (liquids or solids) in a solvent containing one or more dissolved wall-forming materials or excipients (usually the wall-forming material or excipient is a polymer dissolved in a polymer solvent); (2) dispersing the agent/polymer-solvent mixture (the discontinuous phase) into a processing medium (the continuous phase which is preferably saturated with polymer solvent) to form an emulsion; and (3) transferring all of the emulsion immediately to a large volume of processing medium or other suitable extraction medium, to immediately extract the solvent from the microdroplets in the emulsion to form a microencapsulated product, such as microcapsules or microspheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,173, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a process for preparing biodegradable, biocompatible microparticles comprising a biodegradable, biocompatible polymeric binder and a biologically active agent, wherein a blend of at least two substantially non-toxic solvents, free of halogenated hydrocarbons, are used to dissolve both the agent and the polymer. The solvent blend containing the dissolved agent and polymer is dispersed in an aqueous solution to form droplets. The resulting emulsion is added to an aqueous extraction medium preferably containing at least one of the solvents of the blend, whereby the rate of extraction of each solvent is controlled, whereupon the biodegradable, biocompatible microparticles containing the biologically active agent are formed. Active agents suitable for encapsulation by this process include, but are not limited to, norethindrone, risperidone, and testosterone, and a preferred solvent blend is one comprising benzyl alcohol and ethyl acetate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,008, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a microencapsulation process that uses a static mixer. A first phase, comprising an active agent and a polymer, and a second phase are pumped through a static mixer into a quench liquid to form microparticles containing the active agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The documents described above all disclose methods that can be used to prepare microparticles that contain an active agent. As explained, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,173, by appropriately selecting the polymeric materials, a microparticle formulation can be made in which the resulting microparticles exhibit both diffusional release and biodegradation release properties. For a diffusional mechanism of release, the active agent is released from the microparticles prior to substantial degradation of the polymer. The active agent can also be released from the microparticles as the polymeric excipient erodes. However, none of the foregoing documents disclose a specific method for preparing microparticles that have a selected release profile for release of the active agent from the microparticles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need in the art for a method for preparing microparticles having a selected release profile for release of active agent in the microparticles in accordance with the selected release profile. There is a further need in the art for a method for controlling the release profile of the active agent contained in microparticles. The present invention, the description of which is fully set forth below, solves the need in the art for such methods. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an improved method for preparing microparticles that exhibit controlled release of an effective amount of an active agent over an extended period of time. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for preparing microparticles having a selected release profile for release of active agent contained in the microparticles. In one aspect, the method of the present invention comprises: preparing an emulsion that comprises a first phase and a second phase, the first phase comprising the active agent, a polymer, and a solvent for the polymer; quenching the emulsion in a quench liquid to form microparticles containing the active agent; and performing a degree of intermediate drying of the microparticles so that the selected release profile is achieved. If the degree of intermediate drying performed is no intermediate drying, then the resulting microparticles have an initial burst and a substantially linear release profile. If the degree of intermediate drying performed is substantially complete intermediate drying, then the resulting microparticles have an initial lag phase and a substantially sigmoidal release profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the present invention, the method further comprises, after the intermediate drying step, the steps of washing the microparticles and final drying the microparticles. In a preferred aspect of the invention, the washing step is carried out by: introducing the microparticles into a vessel containing an extraction medium having a temperature lower than the glass transition temperature of the microparticles; agitating the vessel contents to disperse the microparticles in the extraction medium; and transferring the microparticles from the vessel to an extraction tank having another extraction medium having a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the microparticles at the time of transfer of the microparticles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, a method for controlling a release profile of an active agent contained in microparticles is provided. The method comprises: forming microparticles containing the active agent by quenching an emulsion in a quench liquid, the emulsion comprising a first phase and a second phase, the first phase comprising the active agent, a polymer, and a solvent for the polymer; and adjusting a degree of drying of the microparticles, the degree of drying affecting the release profile of the active agent from the microparticles. In a further aspect, the degree of drying is adjusted to comprise no intermediate drying, thereby resulting in an initial burst of the active agent and a substantially linear release of the active agent. In another aspect, the degree of drying is adjusted to comprise substantially complete intermediate drying, thereby resulting in an initial lag in release of the active agent and a substantially sigmoidal release of the active agent. In still a further aspect of the invention, the adjusting step comprises: performing a degree of intermediate drying of the microparticles; washing the microparticles; and performing final drying of the microparticles. In yet another aspect of the invention, the washing step comprises: introducing the microparticles into a vessel containing an extraction medium having a temperature lower than the glass transition temperature of the microparticles; agitating the vessel contents to disperse the microparticles in the extraction medium; and transferring the microparticles from the vessel to an extraction tank having another extraction medium having a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the microparticles at the time of transfer of the microparticles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In still a further aspect of the present invention, a microencapsulated active agent having a selected release profile is provided. The microencapsulated active agent is prepared by a method for preparing microparticles, which method comprises: preparing an emulsion that comprises a first phase and a second phase, the first phase comprising the active agent, a polymer, and a solvent for the polymer, quenching the emulsion in a quench liquid to form microparticles containing the active agent; and performing a degree of intermediate drying of the microparticles so that the selected release profile of the active agent from the microparticles is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Features and Advantages </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Advantages of the method of the present invention are that it provides, inter alia, a biodegradable, biocompatible system that can be injected into a patient, the ability to mix microparticles containing different active agents, and the ability to program release by preparing microparticles with selected release profiles and with multiphasic release patterns to give faster or slower rates of active agent release as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A particular advantage of the method of the present invention is that it provides an additional parameter, the degree of intermediate drying, to control the release pattern or profile of microparticles. The method of the present invention is advantageous in that after such parameters as monomer size, coreload, and molecular weight have been determined, the release profile can be adjusted through the degree of intermediate drying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the products prepared by the method of the present invention is that durations of action ranging from several days to more than 200 days can be obtained, depending upon the type of microparticle and release profile selected. In preferred embodiments, the microparticles are designed to afford treatment to patients during duration of action periods of 30 to 100 days. A 60 day duration of action period is considered to be particularly advantageous. As readily apparent to one of skill in the relevant art, the duration of action can be controlled by manipulation of the polymer composition, polymer drug ratio, microparticle size, excipients, and concentration of residual solvent remaining in the microparticle.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Overview </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to microparticles having a selected release profile for release of the active agent from the microparticles, and to a method for the preparation of such microparticles. The release profile refers to the quantity or amount of active agent that is released from the microparticles as a function of time. Release profiles are typically illustrated as the cumulative release, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of active agent present in the microparticles, as a function of time. Different clinical applications, and/or different active agents, may require different types of release profiles. For example, one type of release profile includes an &ldquo;initial burst,&rdquo; or release of a significant amount of active agent from the microparticles within the first 24 hour period. The initial burst may then be followed by a substantially linear release profile after the initial burst. Another type of release profile is a sigmoidal release profile. As used herein, the term &ldquo;sigmoidal&rdquo; refers to a release profile that is substantially &ldquo;S&rdquo;-shaped. As shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> sigmoidal release profile is characterized by an initial lag phase, a steep intermediate release phase, and a flat final release phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The inventors have unexpectedly discovered that the release profile of the microparticles can be controlled by adjusting the degree of drying that is performed on the microparticles during their preparation. Particularly, if an intermediate drying step (between the quench/primary extraction step and the washing step as explained below) is eliminated or is incomplete, then the release profile of the microparticles includes an initial burst followed by a substantially linear release profile. However, if a substantially complete intermediate drying step is performed on the microparticles, then the release profile will be substantially sigmoidal with an initial lag phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After the microparticles undergo the degree of intermediate drying needed for the selected release profile, the microparticles are preferably washed and subjected to a final drying step. To solve the problem of agglomeration of the microparticles during the washing step, in the process of the present invention the microparticles are first introduced into a vessel containing an extraction medium having a temperature lower than the glass transition temperature (T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>) of the microparticles, and the vessel is agitated to wet and to disperse the microparticles in the extraction medium. The cold extraction medium allows the microparticles to be dispersed without agglomeration caused by elevated temperatures. The microparticles are then preferably transferred to a larger extraction tank having extraction medium at a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the microparticles for extraction and washing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;glass transition temperature&rdquo; or &ldquo;T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; refers to the temperature at which the polymer or polymer matrix material of the microparticles changes from a rigid or glassy condition to a soft rubbery condition upon heating. As would be readily apparent to one of skill in the relevant art, the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles will depend in part on processing conditions, such as the solvent used. For example, benzyl alcohol acts as a plasticizer that decreases the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles. Hydrolyzing will also decrease the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles. The molecular weight of the polymer also affects the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles&mdash;the higher the molecular weight of the polymer, the higher the T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To ensure clarity of the description that follows, the following definitions are provided. By &ldquo;initial burst&rdquo; is meant release of a significant amount of active agent from the microparticles within the first 24 hour period, typically greater than about 5% cumulative release. By &ldquo;microparticles&rdquo; or &ldquo;microspheres&rdquo; is meant solid particles that contain an active agent dispersed or dissolved within a polymer that serves as the matrix of the particle. The polymer is preferably biodegradable and biocompatible. By &ldquo;biodegradable&rdquo; is meant a material that should degrade by bodily processes to products readily disposable by the body and should not accumulate in the body. The products of the biodegradation should also be biocompatible with the body. By &ldquo;biocompatible&rdquo; is meant not toxic to the body, is pharmaceutically acceptable, is not carcinogenic, and does not significantly induce inflammation in body tissues. As used herein, &ldquo;body&rdquo; preferably refers to the human body, but it should be understood that body can also refer 30 to a non-human animal body. By &ldquo;weight %&rdquo; or &ldquo;% by weight&rdquo; is meant parts by weight per total weight of microparticle. For example, 10 wt. % active agent would mean 10 parts active agent by weight and 90 parts polymer by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Method and Equipment Description </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> With reference now to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a method for preparing microparticles in accordance with the present invention. In a step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a first phase <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a second phase <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are combined to form an emulsion. One of the two phases is discontinuous, and the other of the two phases is continuous. The first phase preferably comprises an active agent, a polymer, and a solvent for the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferred active agents that can be encapsulated by the process of the present invention include 1,2-benzazoles, more particularly, 3-piperidinyl-substituted 1,2-benzisoxazoles and 1,2 -benzisothiazoles. The most preferred active agents of this kind for treatment by the process of the present invention are 3-&lsqb;2-&lsqb;4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl&rsqb;ethyl&rsqb;-6,7,8,9 -tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido&lsqb;1,2-a&rsqb;pyrimidin-4-one (&ldquo;risperidone&rdquo;) and 3-&lsqb;2-&lsqb;4-(6-fluro-1,2 -benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl&rsqb;ethyl&rsqb;-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido&lsqb;1,2 -a&rsqb;pyrimidin-4-one (&ldquo;9-hydroxyrisperidone&rdquo;) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Risperidone (which term, as used herein, is intended to include its pharmaceutically acceptable salts) is most preferred. Risperidone can be prepared in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The microparticles can be mixed by size or by type so as to provide for the delivery of active agent to the patient in a multiphasic manner and/or in a manner that provides different active agents to the patient at different times, or a mixture of active agents at the same time. For example, secondary antibiotics, vaccines, or any desired active agent, either in microparticle form or in conventional, unencapsulated form can be blended with a primary active agent and provided to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Preferred examples of polymer matrix materials include poly(glycolic acid), poly(d,l-lactic acid), poly(l-lactic acid), copolymers of the foregoing, and the like. Various commercially available poly(lactide-co-glycolide) materials (PLGA) may be used in the method of the present invention. For example, poly (d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) is commercially available from Alkermes, Inc. (Blue Ash, Ohio). A suitable product commercially available from Alkermes, Inc. is a 50:50 poly(d,l-lacticco-glycolic acid) known as MEDISORB&reg; 5050 DL. This product has a mole percent composition of 50% lactide and 50% glycolide. Other suitable commercially available products are MEDISORB&reg; 6535 DL, 7525 DL, 8515 DL and poly(d,l-lactic acid) (100 DL). Poly(lactide-co-glycolides) are also commercially available from Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany) under its Resomer&reg; mark, e.g., PLGA 50:50 (Resomer&reg; RG 502), PLGA 75:25 (Resomer&reg; RG 752) and d,l-PLA (Resomer&reg; RG 206), and from Birmingham Polymers (Birmingham, Ala.). These copolymers are available in a wide range of molecular weights and ratios of lactic acid to glycolic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The most preferred polymer for use in the practice of the invention is the copolymer, poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide). It is preferred that the molar ratio of lactide to glycolide in such a copolymer be in the range of from about 85:15 to about 50:50. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The molecular weight of the polymeric matrix material is of some importance. The molecular weight should be high enough to permit the formation of satisfactory polymer coatings, i.e., the polymer should be a good film former. Usually, a satisfactory molecular weight is in the range of 5,000 to 500,000 daltons, preferably about 150,000 daltons. However, since the properties of the film are also partially dependent on the particular polymeric matrix material being used, it is very difficult to specify an appropriate molecular weight range for all polymers. The molecular weight of the polymer is also important from the point of view of its influence upon the biodegradation rate of the polymer. For a diffusional mechanism of drug release, the polymer should remain intact until all of the drug is released from the microparticles and then degrade. The drug can also be released from the microparticles as the polymeric excipient bioerodes. By an appropriate selection of polymeric materials a microparticle formulation can be made in which the resulting microparticles exhibit both diffusional release and biodegradation release properties. This is useful in according multiphasic release patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The formulation prepared by the process of the present invention contains an active agent dispersed in the microparticle polymeric matrix material. The amount of such agent incorporated in the microparticles usually ranges from about 1 wt. % to about 90 wt. %, preferably 30 to 50 wt. %, more preferably 35 to 40 wt. %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The emulsion is transferred into a quench liquid for the quench or primary extraction step (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). The primary purpose of the quench step is to extract or remove residual solvent from the microparticles that are formed. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, quench step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is followed by a de-watering step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and a rinse step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The objective of de-watering step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is to concentrate the microparticles from the dilute suspension that is formed during extraction step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to a concentrated slurry prior to subsequent drying of the microparticles. The objective of rinse step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is to reduce stickiness of the microparticles. Alternatively, rinse step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is omitted so that drying occurs after de-watering step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An intermediate drying step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is performed after rinse step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, or, alternatively, after de-watering step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> if the rinse step is omitted. The objective of intermediate drying step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is to perform a degree of intermediate drying of the microparticles so that the selected release profile is achieved. As will be explained in more detail below in the Examples, when the degree of intermediate drying performed in step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is no intermediate drying, the result is microparticles having an initial burst and a substantially linear release profile. When the degree of intermediate drying performed in step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is substantially complete intermediate drying, the result is microparticles having an initial lag phase and a substantially sigmoidal release profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> After intermediate drying step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the microparticles are washed in a step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to remove or extract any further residual solvent. The microparticles are de-watered in a step <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> prior to a final drying step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Final drying step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably carried out so that the moisture content of the microparticles is less than about 1%, more preferably approximately equal to about 0.2%. The microparticles are recovered in a step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one embodiment is shown of an equipment configuration for preparing microparticles in accordance with the present invention. The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is particularly well suited for performing a degree of intermediate drying ranging from no intermediate drying to substantially complete intermediate drying. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the equipment contained within the dotted line boundary shown generally at <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is sterilized using a &ldquo;steam-in-place&rdquo; (SIP) process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A first phase <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is provided. First phase <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is preferably the discontinuous phase, comprising a polymer dissolved in one or more solvents, and an active agent. The active agent can be dissolved or dispersed in the same or a different solvent than the solvent(s) in which the polymer is dissolved. A second phase <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is preferably the continuous phase, preferably comprising water as the continuous processing medium. Preferably, an emulsifying agent such as a surfactant or a hydrophilic colloid is added to the continuous phase to prevent the microdroplets from agglomerating and to control the size of the microdroplets in the emulsion. Examples of compounds that can be used as surfactants or hydrophilic colloids include, but are not limited to, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatin, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), Tween 80, Tween 20, and the like. The concentration of surfactant or hydrophilic colloid in the continuous phase will be from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight based on the continuous processing medium, depending upon the surfactant, hydrophilic colloid, the discontinuous phase, and the continuous processing medium used. A preferred continuous phase is 0.1 to 10 wt. %, more preferably 0.5 to 2 wt. %, solution of PVA in water. Although not absolutely necessary, it is preferred to saturate the continuous phase with at least one of the solvents forming the discontinuous phase. This provides a stable emulsion, preventing transport of solvent out of the microparticles prior to quench step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> First phase <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and second phase <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are combined under the influence of mixing means to form an emulsion. A preferred type of mixing means is a static mixer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Other mixing means suitable for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, devices for mechanically agitating the first and second phases, such as homogenizers, propellers, impellers, stirrers, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the discontinuous and continuous phases <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are pumped through static mixer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to form an emulsion, and into a large volume of quench liquid, to obtain microparticles containing the active agent encapsulated in the polymeric matrix material. A pump <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> pumps first phase <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> into static mixer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and a pump <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> pumps second phase <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> into static mixer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. An especially preferred method of mixing with a static mixer in the process of the present invention is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,008, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> First and second phases <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are mixed in static mixer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to form an emulsion. The emulsion formed comprises microparticles containing active agent encapsulated in the polymeric matrix material. The microparticles are then preferably stirred in a quench or extraction tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> containing a quench liquid in order to remove most of the solvent from the microparticles, resulting in the formation of hardened microparticles. Following the movement of the microparticles from static mixer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and entrance into quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the continuous processing medium is diluted, and much of the solvent in the microparticles is removed by extraction. In this extractive quench step (step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>), the microparticles can be suspended in the same continuous phase (second phase <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) used during emulsification, with or without hydrophilic colloid or surfactant, or in another quench liquid. The quench liquid removes a significant portion of the solvent from the microparticles, but does not dissolve them. During the extractive quench step, the quench liquid containing dissolved solvent can, optionally, be removed and replaced with fresh quench liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of quench step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the microparticles are transferred by a pump <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to a device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> that functions as a microparticle collecting device, de-watering device, and drying device. Device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is used to carry out de-watering step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, rinse step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, intermediate drying step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, de-watering step <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, and final drying step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> comprises a vibrating sieve or screen. The vibration causes smaller particles and liquid to drop through the screen, while larger particles are retained. The smaller particles and liquid that drop through the screen are removed as waste <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>. Device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> also functions as a vacuum dryer, through the use of a vacuum line <highlight><bold>237</bold></highlight>. The microparticles are fluidized by the vibrational energy, and by a small amount of a dry gas bleed, preferably a dry nitrogen (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) bleed <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The dry nitrogen bleed, passed on the underside of the screen, helps the microparticles dry more quickly and without agglomeration by assisting in keeping the microparticles moving around. After drying, an internal port on the screen may be opened, and the vibrational energy causes the remaining microparticles to self-discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A suitable device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> for a process of approximately 1 Kg scale is a PHARMASEP Model PH12Y vibratory sieve available from Sweco, Florence, Ky. This device consists of a 25 &mgr; (nom) stainless steel screen approximately eleven inches in diameter that fits in a stainless steel frame. The frame is attached to a base weldment. A smaller six-inch diameter 150 &mgr; screen may also be attached to the weldment but positioned upstream from the 25 &mgr; screen to filter out oversized material. The machine is driven by a one-third horsepower motor (motion generator) designed to transmit vibration to the screen(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> After the completion of intermediate drying step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the dried microparticles need to be transferred to another extraction medium to carry out wash step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Wash step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is preferably carried out in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, using an extraction medium <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> having a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature (T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>) of the microparticles. Directly dispersing the dried microparticles (now in the form of a dry powder) in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is problematic because the dry powder takes time to wet out before dispersing. Because the temperature of the extraction medium in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is higher than the microparticle T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>, the microparticles have a tendency to agglomerate before dispersing. The process of the present invention solves this agglomeration problem in the following manner. To carry out wash step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the microparticles are first introduced into a re-slurry tank or other type of vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, as shown by path <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the extraction medium <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> that is used in vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is lower than the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles. The cold extraction medium in vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> allows the dried microparticles to wet and to disperse without agglomeration caused by elevated temperatures, i.e., temperatures above the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> At the time of transfer of the microparticles into extraction medium <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the temperature of extraction medium <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is higher than the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles. The T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles changes during wash step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as solvents are extracted. At the end of wash step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles is higher than the temperature of extraction medium <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is preferably smaller in size/volume than quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>; consequently the volume of extraction medium in vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> will be less than the volume of extraction medium in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The volume of the extraction medium in vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is preferably small enough relative to the volume of extraction medium in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> so that when the extraction medium and microparticles are transferred from vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> into quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (as shown by path <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>), the temperature of the extraction medium in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is affected only a few degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> preferably has an impeller or other form of agitating device used to agitate the vessel contents, but preferably does not include any baffles. The smaller volume of vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> allows intense agitation so that the microparticles can be dispersed in the extraction medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> After wash step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is completed in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the microparticles are again transferred via pump <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> into device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> for de-watering step <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and final drying step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. At the completion of final drying step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the microparticles are discharged from device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the manner described above into a sifter <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, as shown by path <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Sifter <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is used to fractionate the microparticles by size for filling into vials and for bulk in-process testing (e.g., aspect, active agent content, residual solvents, in vitro release, and particle size distribution). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of an equipment configuration for preparing microparticles in accordance with the present invention. The embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is particularly suitable for performing no intermediate drying. As with the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> combines first and second phases <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in static mixer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to form an emulsion. Quench step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is carried out in quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of quench step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the microparticles are transferred via pump <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> through a filter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> that removes small particles and excess liquid through a waste line <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. The microparticles are then transferred back into quench tank <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> along path <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> to perform wash step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> using extraction medium <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, intermediate drying step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is effectively eliminated, i.e., a degree of intermediate drying that is no intermediate drying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of wash step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the microparticles are transferred via pump <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> through filter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> along path <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> into a strainer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> for de-watering step <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">Effect of Drying Parameters on In Vitro Release </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Nine samples were prepared in accordance with the 1 Kg process described below in Example <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Intermediate drying step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> was varied to determine the effect on the 24 hour in vitro release. An example of measurement of in vitro release is provided below in Example 7. As shown below in Table 1, the intermediate drying step varied from no intermediate drying (sample K), to drying under vacuum in a dryer (samples L, M, and N), to drying under vacuum in a dryer with an additional dry gas sweep (samples O, P, Q, R, and 0121-7). The highest 24 hour in vitro release occurred for the samples having the least amount of intermediate drying. Conversely, the lowest 24 hour in vitro release occurred for the samples having the greater amount of intermediate drying. It was found that substantially complete intermediate drying was achieved by drying under vacuum for a period in the range of approximately 18-24 hours, and drying with a gas sweep (such as a N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or an air sweep) for a period in the range of approximately 6-24 hours.

Table 3 below shows the time in hours of intermediate drying step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, performed using a small dry N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>bleed under a full vacuum. The percent moisture was measured using a batch sample after the indicated drying time using a Karl Fischer process (U.S. Pharmacopeia 921) known to one of skill in the relevant art For samples 0819-7a and 0902-7g, the percent release was measured after 24 hours and after 15 days. These samples exhibit minimal release within 24 hours, indicative of an initial lag phase in release of the active agent. The cumulative release of active agent from these samples are 10.3% and 8.3%, respectively, after 15 days. Samples 0812-7a, 7b, 7c, 0819-7a, 0825-7a, and 0902-7g represent substantially complete intermediate drying, resulting in a moisture content of less than about 0.2% after intermediate drying.

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the release profiles for three batches (0812-7, 0819-7, and 0902-7) that were prepared in accordance with the 1 Kg process described below in Example 6. Each release profile shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a sigmoidal release profile characterized by an initial lag phase (approximately days 1-15), a steep intermediate release phase (approximately days 1640), and a flat final release phase (approximately days 41-60). Each batch was divided into three sub-samples for in vitro release measurements. The average cumulative release (%) of the three sub-samples after day 1 (24 hours) was 0.97% for batch 0812-7, 1.03% for batch 0902-7, and 1.33% for batch 0819-7. The average cumulative release (%) of the three sub-samples after day 15 was 7.36% for batch 0812-7, 8.33% for batch 0902-7, and 10.34% for batch 0819-7. Thus, these samples prepared with substantially complete intermediate drying exhibit minimal release within 24 hours, with an initial lag phase in release of the active agent. Further, the cumulative release of active agent from the microparticles was less than about 15% after 15 days. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A process for preparing microparticles containing risperidone as the active agent in accordance with the present invention will now be described. The following 1 Kg process (400 grams of active agent and 600 grams of polymer) is preferably carried out using the equipment configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The theoretical drug loading of the microparticles is 40%. The actual drug loading that is achieved by the process described below ranges from about 35% to about 39%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A drug solution is prepared by dissolving 400 grams of risperidone (Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium) in 1267 grams of benzyl alcohol to form a 24 wt. % drug solution. A polymer solution is formed by dissolving 600 grams of 75:25 DL PLGA polymer (Alkermes, Inc., Blue Ash, Ohio) in 3000 grams of ethyl acetate to form a 16.7 wt. % polymer solution. The drug solution and the polymer solution are combined to form a first, discontinuous phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The second, continuous phase is prepared by preparing a 30 liter solution of 1% PVA, the PVA acting as an emulsifier. To this is added 2086 grams of ethyl acetate to form a 6.5 wt. % solution of ethyl acetate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The two phases are combined using a static mixer, such as a &frac12;&Prime; Kenics static mixer available from Chemineer, Inc., North Andover, Mass. A total flow rate of 3 L/min generally provides microparticle size distributions with a mass median diameter (MMD) in the range of about 80-90 &mgr;. The ratio of continuous phase to discontinuous phase is 5:1 (v/v). The length of the static mixer can vary from about 9 inches to about 88 inches. Lengths greater than about 48 inches results in the greatest percent yield in a microparticle size range of 25-150 &mgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The quench liquid is 2.5% solution of ethyl acetate and water-for-injection (WFI) at 5-10&deg; C. The volume of the quench liquid is 0.25L per gram of batch size. The quench step is carried out for a time period greater than about 4 hours, with stirring of the microparticles in the quench tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> After completion of the quench step, the microparticles are transferred to the collecting, de-watering, and drying device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and described above. The microparticles are rinsed using a chilled (approximately 5&deg; C.) 17 liter 25% ethanol solution. To form microparticles with a sigmoidal release profile, the microparticles are then subjected to substantially complete intermediate drying. The microparticles are dried in device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> using vacuum and a 2-26 SCFH (Standard Cubic Feet per Hour) of nitrogen bleed. To avoid agglomeration, the temperature is maintained at less than 10&deg; C. by chilling the feed nitrogen. Dryness is monitored by an absolute humidity probe, available from Vaisala, Inc., Woburn, Mass., in the vacuum line of the drying device. Absolute humidity refers to the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the volume of moist air within which the water vapor is contained. To ensure a sigmoidal release profile with an initial lag phase, the drying is carried for a time period greater than about four hours after substantially zero absolute humidity is reached in the drying device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The moisture content of the microparticles at this point is typically less than about 0.2%, generally less than about 0.15%. If the microparticles are not substantially completely dried at this point, then the release profile will be altered to eliminate the lag phase, resulting in an initial burst followed by a substantially linear release profile. The substantially complete intermediate drying can be performed by drying under vacuum with a gas bleed or sweep (air, nitrogen or other dry gas) for a period in the range of approximately 1648 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The microparticles are then re-slurried in a re-slurry tank (such as vessel <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) using a 25% ethanol solution (extraction medium) maintained at a temperature lower than the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles. The temperature in the re-slurry tank is preferably in the range of about 0&deg; C. to about 15&deg; C., preferably less than about 10&deg; C., still more preferably 6&deg;&plusmn;2&deg; C. The microparticles are then transferred back to the quench tank for washing for a time period of at least 6 hours with another extraction medium (25% ethanol solution) that is maintained at a temperature higher than the T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles. The T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>of the microparticles is about 18&deg; C. (about room temperature), and the temperature of the extraction medium in the quench tank is greater than about 18&deg; C., preferably 25&deg;&plusmn;1&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The microparticles are transferred back to the collecting, de-watering, and drying device for de-watering and final drying. The final drying step is carried out in a manner similar to that described above for the intermediate drying step, but the temperature is warmed to greater than about 20&deg; C. but below 40&deg; C. Drying continues for a time period greater than about 16 hours. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> To measure in vitro release as a function of time for a sample of microparticles, the sample is incubated in physiological (pH 7) buffer at 37&deg; C. At periodic time points, a test sample of the incubating sample is drawn. Release of the active agent into the buffer in the test sample is measured spectrophotometrically in a manner well known to one of skill in the relevant art.
