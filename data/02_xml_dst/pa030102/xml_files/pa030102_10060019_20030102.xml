<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is a key regulatory mechanism that controls diverse cellular processes (reviewed in Hochstrasser 1996). In this pathway, ubiquitin is transferred via transthioesterification along a cascade of carrier enzymes, E1-&gt;E2-&gt;E3, and ultimately conjugated in an isopeptide linkage to a lysine residue of a substrate protein. Reiteration of the ubiquitin transferase reaction results in formation of a polyubiquitin chain on the substrate, which is then recognized by the 26S proteasome, and rapidly degraded. Specificity in protein ubiquitination derives from E3 enzymes, also known as ubiquitin-ligases (Hershko et al. 1983). In some cases, an E3 facilitates recognition of the target protein by an E2, while in others an E3 accepts a ubiquitin thioester from an E2 and directly transfers ubiquitin to the substrate (Scheffner et al. 1995). Although substrate recognition is a key aspect of ubiquitin dependent proteolysis, the identification of E3 enzymes has been problematic because the few known E3 families bear no sequence relationship to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is essential for two major cell cycle transitions, the G1 to S phase transition and the metaphase to anaphase transition (reviewed in King et al. 1996). These transitions mediate alteration between states of high and low cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity, which in turn ensures that DNA replication origins fire only once per cell cycle and that chromosome segregation follows DNA replication (reviewed in Nasmyth 1996). Key targets of the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway at these transitions include positive regulators of Cdks, the cyclins, and negative regulators of Cdks, the Cdk inhibitors. In budding yeast, a single Cdk, Cdc28 (or Cdk1) is activated in G1 phase by the G1 cyclins Cln1-Cln3, and in S through M phase by the mitotic cyclins, Clb1-Clb6 (reviewed in Nasmyth, 1996). A motif called the destruction box targets mitotic cyclins and other proteins to a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin-ligase called the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC) or cyclosome (reviewed in King et al. 1996). In contrast, phosphorylation targets G1 cyclins and Cdk inhibitors for degradation via a constitutive ubiquitination pathway (reviewed in Deshaies, 1997). Genetic analysis in budding yeast has revealed several components of this pathway: Cdc4, a WD40 repeat protein (Yochem and Byers, 1987), Cdc34, an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (Goebl et al. 1988), Cdc53, a protein that forms a tight complex with phosphorylated Clns (Willems et al. 1996), Grr1, a leucine rich repeat protein (Flick and Johnston, 1981), and Skp1, a protein that binds to a motif called the F-box (Bai et al. 1996). The F-box motif occurs in Cdc4, Grr1 and several other yeast and mammalian proteins (Bai et al. 1996). Cells lacking functional Cdc4, Cdc34, Cdc53 or Skp1 arrest in G1 because the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 is not degraded, which prevents the onset of Clb-Cdc28 activity and initiation of DNA replication (Nugroho and Mendenhall 1994; Schwob et al. 1994; Bai et al. 1996). In late G1 phase, Sic1 is phosphorylated by the Cln-Cdc28 kinases and thus targeted for ubiquitin dependent proteolysis (Schwob et al. 1994; Schneider et al. 1996; Tyers 1996). Recently, a requirement for Cdc4, Cdc34 and Cln2-Cdc28 activity in Sic1 ubiquitination has been demonstrated in an in vitro yeast extract system (Verma et al. 1997). Cdc34, Cdc53 and Skp1 are also required for Cln degradation (reviewed in Deshaies 1997), as is Grr1 (Barral at al. 1995), although this protein was originally identified because of its role in glucose repression (Flick and Johnston 1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Other important regulatory proteins are degraded via the Cdc34 pathway, including the Cln-Cdc28 inhibitor Far1 (McKinney et al. 1993; Henchoz et al. 1997), the replication protein Cdc6 (Piatti et al. 1996), and the transcription factor Gcn4 (Komitzer et al. 1994). Aside from its G1 function, Skp1 also plays a role in G2 because certain conditional alleles of SKP1 arrest cells in G2, and because Skp1 is a component of the Cbf3 kinetochore complex (Bai et al. 1996; Connelly and Hieter 1996; Stemmann and Lechner 1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Cdc53 interacts with Cdc4 and Cdc34 (Willems et al. 1996; Mathias et al. 1996), and that the F-box of Cdc4 binds Skp1 (Bai et al. 1996). These interactions, and the fact that Cdc53 physically associates with phosphorylated forms of Cln2, suggest that Cdc4, Cdc34, Cdc53 and Skp1 may participate in an E2/E3 ubiquitination complex that recognizes and ubiquitinates phosphorylated substrates (Bai et al. 1996; Willems et al. 1996). Divergence of the Sic1 and Cln degradation pathways apparently occurs at the level of the two F-box proteins. Cdc4 is required for degradation of Sic1 (Schwob et al. 1994), whereas Grr1 is required for Cln1/2 degradation (Barral et al. 1995). It was therefore hypothesized that distinct F-box proteins recruit specific substrates to an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex that contains Skp1 (Bai et al. 1996). The existence of a complex in vivo containing F-box proteins and Cdc34, Cdc53 and Skp1 has yet to be demonstrated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Through analysis of Cdc53-interacting proteins the present inventors determined that Cdc53 forms complexes with Skp1, Cdc34, and each of the F-box proteins Cdc4, Grr1 and Met30 in vivo. Each F-box protein confers functional specificity on a core Cdc34-Cdc53-Skp1 complex for Sic1 degradation, Cln degradation and methionine biosynthesis gene regulation, respectively. The present inventors showed that Cdc53 is a scaffold that tethers Skp1/F-box proteins to Cdc34 within an E2/E3 ubiquitination complex.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise indicated, all terms used herein have the same meaning as they would to one skilled in the art of the present invention. Practitioners are particularly directed to Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ansubel) for definitions and terms of the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Abbreviations for amino acid residues are the standard 3-letter and/or 1-letter codes used in the art to refer to one of the 20 common L-amino acids. Likewise abbreviations for nucleic acids are the standard codes used in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme&rdquo; refers to one of the components involved in ubiquitin transfer reactions to form ubiquitin-protein conjugates which are recognized by the 26S proteasome. An example of an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme is Cdc34, and homologs or portions thereof. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> for a Cdc34 amino acid sequence.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Protein of the Cullin family&rdquo; refers to the family of proteins involved in the regulation of cell division. The archetypal member of the family is Cdc53. The family also includes, homologs and portions of Cdc53, including the proteins regulating cell division in <highlight><italic>C. elegans </italic></highlight>and mammalian cells such as Cul-1, Cul-2, and the metazoan Cdc53 homologs described in Kipreos et al., 1996. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> for sequences for Cdc53 and Cul-2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;F-box binding protein&rdquo; refers to proteins that bind to proteins containing an F-box motif. Examples of F-box binding proteins are Skp1 and Scon C and homologs, and portions, thereof. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> for a Skp1 sequence.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Proteins containing an F-box motif&rdquo; refers to proteins have a characteristic structural motif called the F-box as described in Bai et al, 1996. Examples of the proteins include Cdc4, Grr1, pop1, Met30 , Scon2/Scon3, and several other yeast and mammalian proteins (Bai et al, 1996), and homologs or portions thereof. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> for a Cdc4 sequence, a Met30 sequence, and a Grr1 sequence.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;binding domain&rdquo; is that portion of the molecule in a complex of the invention (i.e. E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, protein of the Cullin family, F-box binding protein, or protein containing an F-box motif) which interacts directly or indirectly with another molecule in a complex of the invention. The binding domain may be a sequential portion of the molecule i.e. a contiguous sequence of amino acids, or it may be conformational i.e. a combination of non-contiguous sequences of amino acids which when the molecule is in its native state forms a structure that interacts with another molecule in a complex of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> By being &ldquo;derived from&rdquo; a binding domain is meant any molecular entity which is identical or substantially equivalent to the native binding domain of a molecule in a complex of the invention (i.e. E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, protein of the Cullin family, F-box binding protein; or protein containing an F-box motif). A peptide derived from a specific binding domain may encompass the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring binding site, any portion of that binding site, or other molecular entity that functions to bind to an associated molecule. A peptide derived from such a binding domain will interact directly or indirectly with an associated molecule in such a way as to mimic the native binding domain. Such peptides may include competitive inhibitors, peptide mimetics, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;interacting&rdquo; refers to a stable association between two molecules due to, for example, electrostatic, hydrophobic, ionic and/or hydrogen-bond interactions under physiological conditions. Certain interacting molecules interact only after one or more of them has been stimulated. For example, a protein containing an F-box motif may only bind to a substrate if the substrate is phosphorylated (eg. phosphorylated Sic1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An enhancer or inhibitor of the interaction of an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme or a F-box binding protein, and a protein of the Cullin family is intended to include a peptide or peptide fragment derived from the binding domain of an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, an F-box binding protein, or a protein of the Cullin family. The enhancer or inhibitor will not include the full length sequence of the wild-type molecule. Peptide mimetics, synthetic molecules with physical structures designed to mimic structural features of particular peptides, may serve as inhibitors or enhancers. Inhibitors or enhancers affect ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. The enhancement or inhibition may be direct, or indirect, or by a competitive or non-competitive mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Peptide mimetics&rdquo; are structures which serve as substitutes for peptides in interactions between molecules (See Morgan et al (1989), Ann. Reports Med. Chem. 24:243-252 for a review ). Peptide mimetics include synthetic structures which may or may not contain amino acids and/or peptide bonds but retain the structural and functional features of a peptide, or enhancer or inhibitor of the invention. Peptide mimetics also include peptoids, oligopeptoids (Simon et al (1972) Proc. Nati. Acad, Sci USA 89:9367); and peptide libraries containing peptides of a designed length representing all possible sequences of amino acids corresponding to a peptide, or enhancer or inhibitor of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Sequences are &ldquo;homologous&rdquo; or considered &ldquo;homologs&rdquo; when at least about 70% (preferably at least about 80 to 90%, and most preferably at least 95%) of the nucleotides or amino acids match over a defined length of the molecule. Substantially homologous also includes sequences showing identity to the specified sequence. Preferably, the amino acid or nucleic acid sequences have an alignment score of greater than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation gap matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater (Dayhoff). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Peptides of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The invention provides peptide molecules which bind to and inhibit the interactions of the molecules in the complexes of the invention. The molecules are derived from the binding domain of an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, a protein of the Cullin family, an F-box binding protein; or a protein containing an F-box motif. For example, peptides of the invention include the following amino acids of Cdc53 (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>): amino acids 448 to 748 (comprising the binding domain for Cdc34) and amino acids 9 to 280 (comprising the binding domain for Skp1), or portions thereof that bind to Cdc34 and Skp1. Other proteins containing these binding domain sequences may be identified with a protein homology search, for example by searching available databases such as GenBank or SwissProt and various search algorithms and/or programs may be used including FASTA, BLAST (available as a part of the GCG sequence analysis package, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), or ENTREZ (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an embodiment of the invention; specific peptides are contemplated that mediate the binding of a protein of the Cullin family preferably Cdc53, and an F-box binding protein preferably Skp1. </paragraph>

The expression vectors contain a nucleic acid molecule encoding a peptide of the invention and the necessary regulatory sequences for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein-sequence. Suitable regulatory sequences may be obtained from a variety of sources, including bacterial, fungal, viral, mammalian, or insect genes (For example, see the regulatory sequences described in Goeddel, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Selection of appropriate regulatory sequences is dependent on the host cell chosen, and may be readily accomplished by one of ordinary skill in the art. Other sequences, such as an origin of replication, additional DNA restriction sites, enhancers, and sequences conferring inducibility of transcription may also be incorporated into the expression vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The recombinant expression vectors may also contain a selectable marker gene which facilitates the selection of transformed or transfected host cells. Suitable selectable marker genes are genes encoding proteins such as G418 and hygromycin which confer resistance to certain drugs, &bgr;-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, firefly luciferase, or an immunoglobulin or portion thereof such as the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin preferably IgG. The selectable markers may be introduced on a separate vector from the nucleic acid of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The recombinant expression vectors may also contain genes which encode a fusion portion which provides increased expression of the recombinant peptide; increased solubility of the recombinant peptide; and/or aid in the purification of the recombinant peptide by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. For example, a proteolytic cleavage site may be inserted in the recombinant peptide to allow separation of the recombinant peptide from the fusion portion after purification of the fusion protein. Examples of fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Amrad Corp., Melboume, Australia), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and pRIT5 (Pharrnacia, Piscataway, N.J.) which fuse glutathione S-transferase (GSY), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the recombinant protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Recombinant expression vectors may be introduced into host cells to produce a transformant host cell. Transformant host cells include prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells which have been transformed or transfected with a recombinant expression vector of the invention. The terms &ldquo;transformed with&rdquo;, &ldquo;transfected with&rdquo;, &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; and &ldquo;transfection&rdquo; are intended to include the introduction of nucleic acid (e.g. a vector) into a cell by one of many techniques known in the art. For example, prokaryotic cells can be transformed with nucleic acid by electroporation or calcium-chloride mediated transformation. Nucleic acid can be introduced into mammalian cells using conventional techniques such as calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofectin, electroporation or microinjection. Suitable methods for transforming and transfecting host cells may be found in Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press (1989)), and other laboratory textbooks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Suitable host cells include a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells. For example, the peptides of the invention may be expressed in bacterial cells such as <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>insect cells (using baculovirus), yeast cells or mammalian cells. Other suitable host cells can be found in Goeddel, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The peptides of the invention may be tyrosine phosphorylated using the method described in Reedijk et al. (The EMBO Journal 11(4):1365, 1992). For example, tyrosine phosphorylation may be induced by infecting bacteria harbouring a plasmid containing a nucleotide sequence encoding a peptide of the invention, with a &lgr;gt11 bacteriophage encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the Elk tyrosine kinase as a LacZ-Elk fusion. Bacteria containing the plasmid and bacteriophage as a lysogen are isolated. Following induction of the lysogen, the expressed peptide becomes phosphorylated by the Elk tyrosine kinase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The peptides of the invention may be synthesized by conventional techniques. For example, the peptides may be synthesized by chemical synthesis using solid phase peptide synthesis. These methods employ either solid or solution phase synthesis methods (see for example, J. M. Stewart, and J. D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Ed., Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford Ill. (1984) and G. Barany and R. B. Merrifield, The Peptides: Analysis Synthesis, Biology editors E. Gross and J. Meienhofer Vol. 2 Academic Press, New York, 1980, pp. 3-254 for solid phase synthesis techniques; and M Bodansky, Principles fo Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Berlin 1984, and E. Gross and J. Meienhofer, Eds., The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biologu, suprs, Vol 1, for classical solution synthesis.) By way of example, the peptides may be synthesized using 9-fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase chemistry with direct incorporation of phosphotyrosine as the N-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl-O-dimethyl phosphono-L-tyrosine derivative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> N-terminal or C-terminal fusion proteins comprising a peptide of the invention conjugated with other molecules may be prepared by fusing, through recombinant techniques, the N-terminal or C-terminal of the peptide, and the sequence of a selected protein or selectable marker with a desired biological function. The resultant fusion proteins contain the peptide fused to the selected protein or marker protein as described herein. Examples of proteins which may be used to prepare fusion proteins include immunoglobulins, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), hemagglutinin (HA), and truncated myc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Cyclic derivatives of the peptides of the invention are also part of the present invention. Cyclization may allow the peptide to assume a more favorable conformation for association with molecules in complexes of the invention. Cyclization may be achieved using techniques known in the art. For example, disulfide bonds may be formed between two appropriately spaced components having free sulfhydryl groups, or an amide bond may be formed between an amino group of one component and a carboxyl group of another component. Cyclization may also be achieved using an azobenzene-containing amino acid as described by Ulysse, L., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 8466-8467. The side chains of Tyr and Asn may be linked to form cyclic peptides. The components that form the bonds may be side chains of amino acids, non-amino acid components or a combination of the two. In an embodiment of the invention, cyclic peptides are contemplated that have a beta-turn in the right position. Beta-turns may be introduced into the peptides of the invention by adding the amino acids Pro-Gly at the right position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to produce a cyclic peptide which is more flexible than the cyclic peptides containing peptide bond linkages as described above. A more flexible peptide may be prepared by introducing cysteines at the right and left position of the peptide and forming a disulphide bridge between the two cysteines. The two cysteines are arranged so as not to deform the beta-sheet and turn. The peptide is more flexible as a result of the length of the disulfide linkage and the smaller number of hydrogen bonds in the beta-sheet portion. The relative flexibility of a cyclic peptide can be determined by molecular dynamics simulations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Peptide mimetics may be designed based on information obtained by systematic replacement of L-amino acids by D-amino acids, replacement of side chains with groups having different electronic properties, and by systematic replacement of peptide bonds with amide bond replacements. Local conformational constraints can also be introduced to determine conformational requirements for activity of a candidate peptide mimetic. The mimetics may include isosteric amide bonds, or D-amino acids to stabilize or promote reverse turn conformations and to help stabilize the molecule. Cyclic amino acid analogues may be used to constrain amino acid residues to particular conformational states. The mimetics can also include mimics of inhibitor peptide secondary structures. These structures can model the 3-dimensional orientation of amino acid residues into the known secondary conformations of proteins. Peptoids may also be used which are oligomers of N-substituted amino acids and can be used as motifs for the generation of chemically diverse libraries of novel molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Peptides that interact with an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, a protein of the Cullin family, an F-box binding protein; or a protein containing an F-box motif may be developed using a biological expression system. The use of these systems allows the production of large libraries of random peptide sequences and the screening of these libraries for peptide sequences that bind to particular proteins. Libraries may be produced by cloning synthetic DNA that encodes random peptide sequences into appropriate expression vectors. (see Christian et al 1992, J. Mol. Biol. 227:711; Devlin et al, 1990 Science 249:404; Cwirla et al 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. USA, 87:6378). Libraries may also be constructed by concurrent synthesis of overlapping peptides (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,871). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Peptides of the invention may be used to identify lead compounds for drug development. The structure of the peptides described herein can be readily determined by a number of methods such as NMR and X-ray crystallography. A comparison of the structures of peptides similar in sequence, but differing in the biological activities they elicit in target molecules can provide information about the structure-activity relationship of the target. Information obtained from the examination of structure-activity relationships can be used to design either modified peptides, or other small molecules or lead compounds which can be tested for predicted properties as related to the target molecule. The activity of the lead compounds can be evaluated using assays similar to those described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Information about structure-activity relationships may also be obtained from co-crystallization studies. In these studies, a peptide with a desired activity is crystallized in association with a target molecule, and the X-ray structure of the complex is determined. The structure can then be compared to the structure of the target molecule in its native state, and information from such a comparison may be used to design compounds expected to possess desired activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The peptides of the invention may be converted into pharmaceutical salts by reacting with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, etc., or organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, benezenesulfonic acid, and toluenesulfonic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The peptides of the invention may be used to prepare monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Conventional methods can be used to prepare the antibodies. As to the details relating to the preparation of monoclonal antibodies reference can be made to Goding, J. W., Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, 2nd Ed., Academic Press, London, 1986. As discussed below the antibodies may be used to identify proteins binding sites for Skp1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The peptides and antibodies specific for the peptides of the invention may be labelled using conventional methods with various enzymes, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive materials. Suitable enzymes, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, and radioactive material are well known to the skilled artisan. Labeled antibodies specific for the peptides of the invention may be used to screen for proteins with Skp1 binding sites, and labeled peptides of the invention may be used to screen for Skp1 binding site containing proteins such as Cdc53. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Computer modelling techniques known in the art may also be used to observe the interaction of a peptide of the invention, and truncations and analogs thereof with a molecule in a complex of the invention e.g. Skp1 (for example, Homology Insight II and Discovery available from BioSym/molecular Simulations, San Diego, Calif., U.S.A.). If computer modelling indicates a strong interaction, the peptide can be synthesized and tested for its ability to interfere with the binding of Cdc53 and Skp1 as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Complexes of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The complexes of the invention include the following: (a) a complex comprising an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, a protein of the Cullin family, and a F-box binding protein, and optionally a protein containing an F-box motif; and (b) a complex comprising a protein of the Cullin family and a protein containing an F-box motif. Complexes also containing molecules that bind to a protein containing an F-box motif (eg. Sic1, Cln, Met 4 or activated forms thereof) are also contemplated. It will be appreciated that the complexes may comprise only the binding domains of the interacting molecules and such other flanking sequences as are necessary to maintain the activity of the complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The invention also contemplates antibodies specific for complexes of the invention. The antibodies may be intact monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, and immunologically active fragments (e.g. a Fab or (Fab)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fragment), an antibody heavy chain, and antibody light chain, a genetically engineered single chain Fv molecule (Ladner et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778), or a chimeric antibody, for example, an antibody which contains the binding specificity of a murine antibody, but in which the remaining portions are of human origin. Antibodies including monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, fragments and chimeras, may be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Antibodies specific for the complexes of the invention may be used to detect the complexes in tissues and to determine their tissue distribution. In vitro and in situ detection methods using the antibodies of the invention may be used to assist in the prognostic and/or diagnostic evaluation of proliferative and/or differentiative disorders. Antibodies specific for the complexes of the invention may also be used therapeutically to decrease the degradation of proteins that interact with F-box containing proteins such as Sic1, Cln, and Met4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The complexes of the invention play a central role in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and some genetic diseases may include mutations at the binding domain regions of the interacting molecules in the complexes of the invention. Therefore, if a complex of the invention is implicated in a genetic disorder, it may be possible to use PCR to amplify DNA from the binding domains to quickly check if a mutation is contained within one of the domains. Primers can be made corresponding to the flanking regions of the domains and standard sequencing methods can be employed to determine whether a mutation is present. This method does not require prior chromosome mapping of the affected gene and can save time by obviating sequencing the entire gene encoding a defective protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Methods for Identifying or Evaluating Substances/Compounds </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The methods described herein are designed to identify substances that modulate the activity of a complex of the invention thus affecting ubquitin dependent proteolysis. Novel substances are therefore contemplated that bind to molecules in the complexes, or bind to other proteins that interact with the molecules, to compounds that interfere with, or enhance the interaction of the molecules in a complex, or other proteins that interact with the molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The substances and compounds identified using the methods of the invention include but are not limited to peptides such as soluble peptides including Ig-tailed fusion peptides, members of random peptide libraries and combinatorial chemistry-derived molecular libraries made of D- and/or L-configuration amino acids, phosphopeptides (including members of random or partially degenerate, directed phosphopeptide libraries), antibodies &lsqb;e.g. polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, anti-idiotypic, chimeric, single chain antibodies, fragments, (e.g. Fab, F(ab)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and Fab expression library fragments, and epitope-binding fragments thereof)&rsqb;, and small organic or inorganic molecules. The substance or compound may be an endogenous physiological compound or it may be a natural or synthetic compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Substances which modulate the activity of a complex of the invention can be identified based on their ability to bind to a molecule in the complex. Therefore, the invention also provides methods for identifying novel substances which bind molecules in the complex. Substances identified using the methods of the invention may be isolated, cloned and sequenced using conventional techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Novel substances which can bind with a molecule in a complex of the invention may be identified by reacting one of the molecules with a test substance which potentially binds to the molecule, under conditions which permit the formation of substance-molecule conjugates and removing and/or detecting the conjugates. The conjugates can be detected by assaying for substance-molecule conjugates, for free substance, or for non-complexed molecules. Conditions which permit the formation of substance-molecule conjugates may be selected having regard to factors such as the nature and amounts of the substance and the molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The substance-molecule conjugate, free substance or non-complexed molecules may be isolated by conventional isolation techniques, for example, salting out, chromatography, electrophoresis, gel filtration, fractionation, absorption, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, agglutination, or combinations thereof. To facilitate the assay of the components, antibody against the molecule or the substance, or labelled molecule, or a labelled substance may be utilized. The antibodies, proteins, or substances may be labelled with a detectable substance as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A molecule, or complex of the invention, or the substance used in the method of the invention may be insolubilized. For example, a molecule, or substance may be bound to a suitable carrier such as agarose, cellulose, dextran, Sephadex, Sepharose, carboxymethyl cellulose polystyrene, filter paper, ion-exchange resin, plastic film, plastic tube, glass beads, polyamine-methyl vinyl-ether-maleic acid copolymer, amino acid copolymer, ethylene-maleic acid copolymer, nylon, silk, etc: The carrier may be in the shape of, for example, a tube, test plate, beads, disc, sphere etc. The insolubilized protein or substance may be prepared by reacting the material with a suitable insoluble carrier using known chemical or physical methods, for example, cyanogen bromide coupling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The invention also contemplates a method for evaluating a compound for its ability to modulate the biological activity of a complex of the invention, by assaying for an agonist or antagonist (i.e.enhancer or inhibitor) of the binding of molecules in the complex. The basic method for evaluating if a compound is an agonist or antagonist of the binding of molecules in a complex of the invention, is to prepare a reaction mixture containing molecules and the substance under conditions which permit the formation of complexes, in the presence of a test compound. The test compound may be initially added to the mixture, or may be added subsequent to the addition of molecules. Control reaction mixtures without the test compound or with a placebo are also prepared. The formation of complexes is detected and the formation of complexes in the control reaction but not in the reaction mixture indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction of the molecules. The reactions may be carried out in the liquid phase or the molecules, or test compound may be immobilized as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the agonists and antagonists i.e. inhibitors and enhancers that can be assayed using the methods of the invention may act on one or more of the binding sites on the interacting molecules in the complex including agonist binding sites, competitive antagonist binding sites, non-competitive antagonist binding sites or allosteric sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The invention also makes it possible to screen for antagonists that inhibit the effects of an agonist of the interaction of molecules in a complex of the invention. Thus, the invention may be used to assay for a compound that competes for the same binding site of a molecule in a complex of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The invention also contemplates methods for identifying novel compounds that bind to proteins that interact with a molecule of a complex of the invention. Protein-protein interactions may be identified using conventional methods such as co-immunoprecipitation, crosslinking and co-purification through gradients or chromatographic columns. Methods may also be employed that result in the simultaneous identification of genes which encode proteins interacting with a molecule. These methods include probing expression libraries with labeled molecules. Additionally, x-ray crystallographic studies may be used as a means of evaluating interactions with substances and molecules. For example, purified recombinant molecules in a complex of the invention when crystallized in a suitable form are amenable to detection of intra-molecular interactions by x-ray crystallography. Spectroscopy may also be used to detect interactions and in particular, Q-TOF instrumentation may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Two-hybrid systems may also be used to detect protein interactions in vivo. Generally, plasmids are constructed that encode two hybrid proteins. A first hybrid protein consists of the DNA-binding domain of a transcription activator protein fused to a molecule in a complex of the invention, and the second hybrid protein consists of the transcription activator protein&apos;s activator domain fused to an unkown protein encoded by a cDNA which has been recombined into the plasmid as part of a cDNA library. The plasmids are transformed into a strain of yeast (e.g. <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>) that contains a reporter gene (e.g. lacZ, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase) whose regulatory region contains the transcription activator&apos;s binding site. The hybrid proteins alone cannot activate the transcription of the reporter gene. However, interaction of the two hybrid proteins reconstitutes the functional activator protein and results in expression of the reporter gene, which is detected by an assay for the reporter gene product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that fusion proteins and recombinant fusion proteins may be used in the above-described methods. It will also be appreciated that the complexes of the invention may be reconstituted in vitro using recombinant molecules and the effect of a test substance may be evaluated in the reconstituted system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The reagents suitable for applying the methods of the invention to evaluate substances and compounds that modulate ubiquitin dependent proteolysis may be packaged into convenient kits providing the necessary materials packaged into suitable containers. The kits may also include suitable supports useful in performing the methods of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Compositions and Treatments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The peptides of the invention, and substances and compounds identified using the methods of the invention may be used to modulate ubiquitin dependent proteolysis, and they may be used to modulate cellular processes such as proliferation, growth, and/or differentiation of cells in which the compounds or substances are introduced. Thus, the substances may be used for the treatment of proliferative disorders including various forms of cancer such as leukemias, lymphomas (Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins), sarcomas, melanomas, adenomas, carcinomas of solid tissue, hypoxic tumors, squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth, throat, larynx, and lung, genitourinary cancers such as cervical and bladder cancer, breast, ovarian, colon, hematopoietic cancers, head and neck cancers, and nervous system cancers, benign lesions such as papillomas, arthrosclerosis, angiogenesis, and viral infections, in particular HIV infections, psoriasis, bone diseases, fibroproliferative disorders such as involving connective tissue, atherosclerosis and other smooth muscle proliferative disorders, chronic inflammation, and arthropathies such as arthritis. In addition to proliferative disorders, the treatment of differentiative disorders which result from, for example, de-differentiation of tissue which may be accompanied by abnormal reentry into mitosis. Such degenerative disorders that may be treated using the peptides and compositions of the invention include neurodegenerative disorders such as chronic neurodegenerative diseases of the nervous system, including Alzheimer&apos;s disease, Parkinson&apos;s disease, Huntington&apos;s chorea, amylotrophic lateral sclerosis and the like, as well as spinocerebellar degeneration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the peptides, substances, antibodies, and compounds may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for adminstration to subjects in a biologically compatible form suitable for administration in vivo. By &ldquo;biologically compatible form suitable for administration in vivo&rdquo; is meant a form of the substance to be administered in which any toxic effects are outweighed by the therapeutic effects. The substances may be administered to living organisms including humans, and animals. Administration of a therapeutically active amount of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is defined as an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired result. For example, a therapeutically active amount of a substance may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. Dosage regima may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The acute substance may be administered in a convenient manner such as by injection (subcutaneous, intravenous, etc.), oral administration, inhalation, transdermal application, or rectal administration. Depending on the route of administration, the active substance may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of enzymes, acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The compositions described herein can be prepared by per se known methods for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which can be administered to subjects, such that an effective quantity of the active substance is combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Suitable vehicles are described, for example, in Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences (Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., USA 1985). On this basis, the compositions include, albeit not exclusively, solutions of the substances or compounds in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents, and contained in buffered solutions with a suitable pH and iso-osmotic with the physiological fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The activity of the substances, compounds, antibodies, and compositions of the invention may be confirmed in animal experimental model systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides methods for studying the function of a complex of the invention. Cells, tissues, and non-human animals lacking in the complexes or partially lacking in molecules in the complexes may be developed using recombinant expression vectors of the invention having specific deletion or insertion mutations in the molecules. A recombinant expression vector may be used to inactivate or alter the endogenous gene by homologous recombination, and thereby create complex deficient cells, tissues or animals. Null alleles may be generated in cells and may then be used to generate transgenic non-human animals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The following non-limiting examples are illustrative of the present invention: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The following materials and methods were used in the investigations described in the example. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Plasmids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Plasmids were constructed using standard molecular cloning techniques (Table 1). For two hybrid screens, the CDC53 open reading frame was cloned into the BamH1 site of pAS2 (provided by S. Elledge) to create a Gal4<highlight><superscript>DBD</superscript></highlight>-Cdc53 fusion. Versions that lacked either the N-terminal 280 residues (Gal4<highlight><superscript>DBD</superscript></highlight>-Cdc53<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;N</superscript></highlight>) or internal residues 581-664 (Gal4<highlight><superscript>DBD</superscript></highlight>-Cdc53<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;K</superscript></highlight>) were created by digestion with NcoI or KpnI respectively and religating. Gal4<highlight><superscript>AD</superscript></highlight>-Cdc4<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;3WD </superscript></highlight>is derived from a truncated CDC4 PCR product (Skowyra et al., 1997) cloned into the BamHI site of pGAD424. To test the Skp1-Met30 interaction in the two hybrid system, a SKP1 fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pVAD1, to create a VP16-Skp1 fusion. LexA-Met30 derivatives were based on pLEXM30-4 (Thomas et al. 1995). Met30 was tagged at the N-terminus with an HA epitope by insertion of a MET30 fragment encoding amino acids 7-640 from pLEXM30-4 into a pADH1-HA expression plasmid (Li and Johnston 1997). Cdc4 was tagged at the N-terminus with a FLAG epitope by site directed mutagenesis. A CDC53 deletion construct was made by replacing an internal BgIII fragment of pGEM53-8 (Mathias et al. 1996) with an ADE2 fragment. To allow for negative selection of wild type CDC53 in the cdc53<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;</superscript></highlight> shuffle strain a 3.6 kbp EcoRI fragment of CDC53 was cloned into a &lt;URA3 CEN&gt; plasmid. Charged to alanine mutagenesis of Cdc53 was carried out in pMT843, as described previously (Willems et al. 1996). Although none of the mutations caused any obvious phenotype, restriction sites incorporated during mutagenesis were used to construct the deletions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The version of Cdc53 in which all six cysteine residues are replaced by alanines (C59A, C157A, C412A, C606A, C754A, C774A) was created in a single site-directed mutagenesis reaction. </paragraph>

Complementation of the shuffle strain by various &lt;CDC53<highlight><superscript>M </superscript></highlight>CEN&gt; plasmids was tested by plating on 0.1% FOA medium. cdc53 Skp1 double mutants were generated in crosses of MTY871 with Y553 and Y555 (Bai et al. 1996). The cln2::pGAL1-CLN2M -LEU2 strain was created by integrating pMT1111 into K699a. The MET30-1 strain (CC786-1A) was created by crossing W303-1B with CM100-1A (Thomas et al. 1995). MET25 mRNA expression was assayed in cultures grown in B media supplemented with 0.1 mM sulfate as the sulfur source (Thomas et al. 1995).

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> To identify proteins that interact with Cdc53, two hybrid screens were carried out with full length Cdc53 and two Cdc53 deletion mutants (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). Two Cdc53 fusion proteins, Gal4<highlight><superscript>DBD</superscript></highlight>-Cdc53 and Gal4<highlight><superscript>DBD</superscript></highlight>-Cdc53<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;K</superscript></highlight>, recovered multiple independent isolates of Skp1, Cdc4 and Met30 from Gal4<highlight><superscript>AD </superscript></highlight>genomic and cDNA libraries (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, 1C</cross-reference>). None of the positive clones recovered interacted with Gal4<highlight><superscript>DBD</superscript></highlight>-Cdc53<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;N</superscript></highlight>, suggesting that the N-terminal region of Cdc53 was important for these interactions (see below). Met30 was originally isolated as a methionine-dependent repressor of methionine biosynthesis gene expression, and has a similar overall structure as Cdc4, with an N-terminal F-box and C-terminal WD40 repeats (Thomas et al. 1995; Bai et al. 1996). All of the Met30 and Cdc4 isolates that interacted with Cdc53 contained the F-box motif, suggesting the F-box may mediate interactions with Cdc53. In fact, two of three independent Met30 isolates contained just the F-box and a small amount of flanking region (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>). Similarly, three independent Cdc4 isolates encompassed the F-box but lacked more N-terminal sequences. Cdc4 and Met30 isolates missing some or all of the WD40 repeats did however interact more weakly with Cdc53 than the full length proteins (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, C</cross-reference>), which may reflect an auxiliary role for the WD40 repeats. Since Cdc4 binds Skp1 via the F-box motif (Bai et al. 1996), a Met30-Skp1 interaction was directly tested for in the two hybrid system. The F-box of Met30 was both necessary and sufficient for interaction of Met30 with Skp1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>). As for the Cdc53-Met30 interaction, the WD40 repeats of Met30 were required for maximal interaction with Skp1. In summary, two hybrid analysis revealed a Cdc53-Skp1 interaction and suggested the possibility that Cdc53-F-box protein interactions may be bridged by Skp1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Cdc53 and Skp1 Interact Genetically </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> To assess the in vivo relevance of the Cdc53-SkpI two hybrid interaction,-genetic interactions were tested between CDC53 and SKP1. The cdc53-1 mutation was combined with the Skp1-11 and Skp1-12 mutations. At a semi-permissive temperature of 30&deg; C. both tht cdc53-1 Skp1-11 and cdc53-1 Skp1-12 double mutants were inviable, whereas either single mutant grew as well as the wild type strain (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). Even at a permissive temperature of 25&deg; C., cdc53-1 Skp1-12 double mutants had a severe growth defect, and accumulated multiple hyperpolarized buds (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>), akin to the arrest phenotype of single mutants in the Cdc34 pathway (Mathias et al. 1996). In addition, overproduction of CDC53 was found to rescue Skp1 temperature sensitive strains (E. Patton, unpublished data), as reported elsewhere (Skowrya et al. 1997). This genetic evidence suggests that the Cdc53-Skp1 two hybrid interaction reflects a common function of Cdc53 and Skp1 in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Cdc53 Associates with Skp1 and Cdc4 in Yeast Lysates </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Next it was determined whether endogenous levels of Cdc53 and Skp1 form a complex in yeast lysates. To minimize possible disruption of complexes by antibodies, epitope-tagged versions of Cdc53 and Skp1 were used. Immunoprecipitation of MYC-tagged Cdc53, followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies directed against Skp1, revealed a specific association between Cdc53 and Skp1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, lane 2). Cdc4 and Cdc34 were also present in the Cdc53 complexes, consistent with the observation that Cdc4 and Cdc53 cofractionate with polyhistidine tagged Cdc34 (Mathias et al. 1996). In the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiment, Cdc53 specifically associated with HA-tagged Skp1, as did Cdc4 and Cdc34 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, lane 2). Taken together, these results indicate that Cdc53 likely forms a multiprotein complex in vivo with Skp1, Cdc4 and Cdc34. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> To determine if any of these protein-protein interactions correlated with function in vivo, the composition of the Cdc53 complex was examined in various temperature sensitive strains. In one set of experiments, Cdc53 immune complexes were immunoblotted with anti-Cdc4, anti-Cdc34 and anti-Skp1 antibodies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>). In cdc4-1 and Skp1-11 mutants, Cdc4 was not detected in Cdc53 immune complexes. Although this observation was consistent with a bridging role for Skp1, the absence of Cdc4 from the complexes was due at least in part to decreased Cdc4 abundance in the mutants (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). The Skp1-12 mutation severely decreased the abundance of Cdc4, Cdc53 and Skp1 itself, and so the absence of associated proteins in Cdc53 complexes from Skp1-12 cells was not informative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In another set of experiments, Skp1 immune complexes from temperature sensitive strains were immunoblotted with anti-Cdc4, anti-Cdc34 and anti-Cdc53 antibodies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). In this configuration, the amount of Cdc4 in the complex was also reduced by the cdc4-1 mutation. In contrast, the amount of Cdc4 in the complex was increased by both the cdc34-2 and cdc53-1 mutations. Relative to the abundance of Cdc34 in lysates, the amount of Cdc34 in Skp1 complexes was severely compromised by the cdc53-1 mutation. Cdc53 may therefore bridge the Cdc34-Skp1 interaction (see below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As the anti-Cdc4 antibodies used could not reliably detect Cdc4 in yeast lysates, it was not possible to determine directly if the Skp1 mutations reduced the abundance of Cdc4. However, immunoprecipitation of a FLAG-tagged version of Cdc4 followed by immunoblotting with anti-Cdc4 polyclonal antibody revealed that Cdc4 abundance is greatly diminished in Skp1-11 and Skp1-12 strains (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). The abundance of another F-box protein, Met30, was similarly reduced by the Skp1-11 and Skp1-12 mutations (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). As noted above, the abundance of Cdc53 is also decreased by the Skp1-12 mutation. Thus, Skp1 may function at least in part to stabilize both Cdc53 and F-box proteins. Overall, each of temperature sensitive mutations perturbs the mutual interactions, by altering the abundance of a given component in lysates and/or the immune complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Cdc53 Interacts with Two Other F Box Proteins, Met30 and Grr1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> To corroborate the Cdc53-Met30 and Skp1-Met30 two hybrid interactions, studies were carried out to determine if Met30 formed complexes with Cdc53 and Skp1 in yeast lysates. For this purpose an HA-tagged version of Met30 expressed from the constitutive ADH1 promoter was used. Immunoprecipitation of Met30 followed by immunoblotting against Cdc53 and Skp1 revealed the presence of both Cdc53 and Skp1 in Met30 immune complexes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Because several lines of evidence suggest that Grr1 may function with Skp1 and Cdc53 to mediate Cln1/2 degradation (Barral et al. 1995; Bai et al. 1996; Willems et al. 1996), studies were carried out to test if Grr1 interacts with Cdc53. Indeed, both Cdc53 and Skp1 were specifically immunoprecipitated with an HA-tagged version of Grr1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). In a control experiment, FLAG-tagged Cdc4 immune complexes also contained Cdc53 and Skp1, thereby completing the set of pairwise coimmunoprecipitations between Cdc4, Cdc34, Cdc53 and Skp1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, B</cross-reference>; Mathias et al. 1996). It was not possible to reproducibly detect Cdc34 in the F-box protein immune complexes, perhaps because each of these complexes necessarily contains only a fraction of the total Cdc34, Cdc53 and Skp1. Within the limits of the antibodies it was not possible to detect Cdc4 in Met30 and Grr1 immune complexes, suggesting that F-box proteins form mutually exclusive complexes (data not shown). Thus, Skp1 and Cdc53 form independent complexes with at least three different F-box proteins in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The ability of Cdc53 to interact with multiple F-box proteins raised the possibility that different F-box proteins may compete for binding to a Cdc34-Cdc53-Skp1 core complex. This possibility was tested by overexpressing MET30 or GRR1 in cdc4-1, cdc34-2 and cdc53-1 temperature sensitive strains. Overexpression of MET30 dramatically impaired growth of a cdc4-1 strain at 30&deg; C., and caused a mild growth defect in cdc53 and cdc34 strains (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>) but had no effect on either Skp1-11 or Skp1-12 strains (data not shown). Although overexpression of GRR1 did not affect growth of a cdc4-1 strain, the growth of cdc34-2 and cdc53-1 strains was retarded at 30&deg; C. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). It has been noted previously that high level expression of GRR1 is lethal in Skp1-12 strains at 30&deg; C. (Li and Johnston 1997), and high level expression of Cdc4 causes inviability of cdc34 and cdc53 strains at 23&deg; C. (Mathias et al. 1996). Taken together, the above results suggest various F-box proteins may compete for binding to a core Cdc34-Cdc53-Skp1 complex in vivo, and that the relative stoichiometry of the various complexes is critical for viability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Cdc53 is a Scaffold Protein for Cdc34 and Skp1-F-Box Protein Complexes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> To identify potential protein-protein interaction domains of Cdc53, a series of Cdc53 deletion mutants were constructed using natural and engineered restriction sites (see Methods). Each of the mutant proteins was expressed to similar levels as wild type Cdc53 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). The ability of each Cdc53 mutant protein to interact with Cdc34. Skp1 and the three F-box proteins Cdc4, Grr1, Met30 was assessed by immunoblot analysis of MYC-tagged Cdc53 immune complexes with specific polyclonal antibodies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). In this experiment, each of the interactions detected involved approximately wild type levels of Cdc53 (which was expressed from a low copy plasmid) and endogenous levels of each of the associated proteins. Deletion of an N-terminal region of Cdc53 (residues 9-280) completely disrupted Skp1 binding. In parallel, the binding of all three F-box proteins was specifically disrupted. Importantly, Cdc34 still interacted with Cdc53<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;9-280</superscript></highlight>, eliminating the possibility that the truncated protein was simply misfolded and entirely non-functional. Conversely, deletion of an internal region of Cdc53 (residues 448-748) abrogated Cdc34 binding but did not affect binding of Skp1 or any of the F-box proteins. The strict correlation between the Cdc53-Skp1 interaction and Cdc53-F-box protein interactions is most easily explained by a bridging function for Skp1. Furthermore, the independent non-overlapping binding regions in Cdc53 indicate that the protein-protein interactions within Cdc53 complexes occur in a modular fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Importantly, Cdc53 mutants that were unable to bind either Skp1/F-box proteins or Cdc34 could not complement a cdc53 deletion strain, while mutants unaffected in protein-protein interactions could complement (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>). In order to determine if the Skp1/F-box protein and Cdc34 binding domains of Cdc53 corresponded to conserved regions of Cdc53, 15 different members-of the Cdc53 family were aligned (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, see Methods for details of the sequence alignment). Sequence similarity within the Cdc53 family is restricted to a broad internal region and a narrow region at the extreme C-terminus. Surprisingly, the latter region is not required for binding to Skp1/F-box proteins or Cdc34, nor for viability (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A, B</cross-reference>). However, the internal conserved region overlaps with the Cdc34 binding site. There is relatively poor conservation in the N-terminus of Cdc53, despite the fact that this region contains the Skp1 binding site. The interaction with Skp1 may possibly be limited to a subset of the Cdc53 family. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Based on the sequence alignment many conserved charged residues in Cdc53 were mutated to alanines but none of the mutants had any overt phenotype. For instance, mutation of the most conserved stretch in the entire protein, IVRIMK (residues 755-760), to polyalanine did not cause an obvious defect in Cdc53 function or in binding to Skp1/F-box proteins or Cdc34 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A, B</cross-reference>). To further explore the structure/function relationship of Cdc53, the sequence of two temperature sensitive alleles of CDC53 were determined. The cdc53-1 mutation causes an R488C substitution while the cdc53-2 mutation causes a G340D substitution. Both mutations alter highly conserved residues, even though G340 does not lie within a window of conserved residues. Interestingly, the cdc53-1 mutation occurs within the Cdc34 binding region. In conjunction with the defective Skp1-Cdc34 interaction in cdc53-1 strains (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>), this result strongly suggests that the cdc53-1 mutation specifically perturbs the Cdc34 binding site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In addition to target protein recognition, some E3 ligases form ubiquitin thioester intermediates on catalytic cysteine residues (Scheffner et al. 1995). As Cdc53 is a component of an E3 ligase complex, studies were carried out to determine whether any of the cysteine residues in the Cdc53 sequence were required for function in vivo. Simultaneous mutation of all six cysteine residues in Cdc53 to alanine did not impair complementation of a cdc53 deletion strain (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>). Although this mutational analysis does not rule out thioester formation on Cdc53, such reactions cannot be essential for viability. The primary function of Cdc53 is therefore to act as a scaffold protein for Skp1/F-box proteins and Cdc34. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Cdc34, Cdc53 and Skp1 are Mediators of Methionine Repression </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> To assess the biological significance of the Cdc53-Met30 and Skp1-Met30 interactions, experiments were carried out to determined if Cdc34, Cdc53, or Skp1 were required for proper regulation of methionine biosynthesis genes. The regulation of MET25, which encodes homocysteine synthase and is representative of methionine regulated genes was examined. MET25 is activated by the Cbf1-Met4-Met28 transcriptional complex and repressed by Met30 (Thomas et al. 1995; Kuras et al. 1996). As expected, methionine repressed MET25 expression in wild type cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). As MET30 is an essential gene, an antimorphic allele called MET30-1 was used as a positive control for methionine derepression (Thomas et al. 1995). As shown previously, MET25 is incompletely repressed by methionine in MET30-1 cells. Strikingly, repression of MET25 by methionine was severely compromised in cdc53-1 cells and completely defective in cdc34-2, Skp1-11 and Skp1-12 cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>). In contrast, MET25 was effectively repressed with wild type kinetics in cdc4-1 cells, thereby demonstrating the specificity of F-box protein function in methionine biosynthesis gene regulation. The derepression of MET25 observed in cdc34, cdc53 and Skp1 mutants did not depend on G1 phase cell cycle arrest because derepression did not occur in cdc4-1 cells which arrest at the identical point in G1, and yet did occur in Skp1-12 mutants which arrest in G2 phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Specificity of F-Box Protein Function in Cln2 Degradation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> It has been shown previously that Cln2 is stabilized in Grr1&Dgr;, cdc34-2, cdc53-1 and Skp1-12 strains (Barral et al. 1995; Deshaies et al. 1995; Bai et al. 1996; Willems et al. 1996). To directly assess the specificity of F-box protein function in Cln2 degradation, the halflife of Cln2 in cdc4-1, Grr1&Dgr; and MET30-1 strains was compared. We used glucose repression of a pGAL1-CLN2<highlight><superscript>HA </superscript></highlight>construct to measure Cln2 decay rates, as described previously (Willems et al. 1996). Cln2 was strongly stabilized in Grr1&Dgr;cells, slightly stabilized in cdc4-1 cells and not stabilized at all in MET30-1 cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>). Thus Grr1 is the primary mediator of Cln2 degradation, at least under the conditions employed in these experiments. In contrast to Cln2 degradation, and consistent with previous results (Schwob et al. 1994; Bai et al. 1996), Sic1 degradation was found to require Cdc4, but not Grr1 or Met30 (E. Patton, unpublished data). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Modular Protein-Protein Interactions Allow Combinatorial Control of Skp1-Cdc53-F-Box Protein (SCF) Complexes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Cdc53 was shown to form a multiprotein complex in vivo with Cdc4, Cdc34 and Skp1. Furthermore, two other F-box proteins, Grr1 and Met30 , form analogous complexes with Skp 1 and Cdc53. Consistent with these in vivo observations, recombinant Cdc4 and Grr1 assemble into a complex with Cdc34, Cdc53 and Skp1 (Skowrya et al. 1997). To simplify description of the various F-box containing complexes, the generic term SCF, for Skp1-Cdc53-F-box protein complex has been adopted(Skowrya et al. 1997; Feldman et al. 1997). The specific F-box complexes described above are thus designated SCF<highlight><superscript>Cdc4</superscript></highlight>, SCF<highlight><superscript>Grr1 </superscript></highlight>and SCF<highlight><superscript>Met30</superscript></highlight>. Formally, SCF complexes are E3 ubiquitin-ligases, as they interact with both substrates and an E2 enzyme, Cdc34 (Willems et al., 1996; Feldman et al. 1997; Skowrya et al. 1997). In another sense, the Cdc34-Cdc53-Skp1 triad forms a core complex that adapts to various F-box proteins via Skp1; this complex is referred to as the E2/E3 core complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Substantial evidence indicates that Skp1 bridges F-box proteins to Cdc53. First, the F-box of Met30 is sufficient for interaction with Skp1 and Cdc53 in the two hybrid system. Second, analysis of Cdc53 complexes from Skp1 and cdc4 strains shows that Cdc4 is dispensable for the Cdc53-Skp1 interaction. Third, deletion analysis of Cdc53 reveals that the interaction domain for Skp1 matches that of three different F-box proteins, Cdc4, Grr1 and Met30. Furthermore, like the Cdc4-Skp1 interaction, the Cdc53-Skp1 interaction occurs in the absence of other proteins in vitro (Skowrya et al. 1997). However, the interaction of Skp1 with Grr1 in the two hybrid system requires both the F-box and the leucine rich repeats of Grr1 (Li and Johnston 1997). Similarly, the WD40 repeats of Cdc4 and Met30 are required for maximal interaction with Skp1. Overall, it is certain that one function of Skp1 is to help recruit F-box proteins to Cdc53 complexes, perhaps in conjunction with other domains. As noted above, Skp1 may also be required for stabilization of F-box proteins and Cdc53 in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In addition to the Skp1-F-box interaction, protein-protein interactions within the E2/E3 core complex are of a modular nature. Skp1 binds to the N-terminal region of Cdc53, whereas Cdc34 binds a conserved internal region of Cdc53. The modular nature of these protein-protein interactions and the absence of cysteine-dependent functions in vivo indicates that Cdc53 is a scaffold protein that may anchor Cdc34, Skp1, F-box protein and substrate in the appropriate orientation for ubiquitin transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> F-Box Proteins Confer Specificity on SCF Function </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Despite identification of Cdc34, Cdc53 and Skp1 through defects in Sic1 degradation, it is now clear that SCF complexes also control Cln degradation, glucose repression and methionine repression. SCF<highlight><superscript>Cdc4 </superscript></highlight>regulates the G1 to S phase transition through proteolysis of several key cell cycle regulators. The dramatic cell cycle arrest phenotype caused by loss of SCF<highlight><superscript>Cdc4 </superscript></highlight>obscures the pleiotropic functions of the E2/E3 core complex, despite the fact that Met30 and Grr1 play crucial roles in cellular metabolism (Flick and Johnston 1991; Thomas et al. 1995). SCF<highlight><superscript>Grr1 </superscript></highlight>has a role in both nutrient sensing and cell division, through regulation of glucose repression and Cln degradation, respectively (Flick and Johnston 1991; Barral et al. 1995; Li and Johnston 1997). The present inventors have discovered the existence of a third SCF complex, SCF<highlight><superscript>Met30</superscript></highlight>, and demonstrated that in addition to Met30, each component of the E2/E3 core complex is required for regulation of methionine biosynthesis genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The specificity of each SCF complex for different cellular processes is demonstrated by a remarkable absence of cross-talk between some of the pathways. For instance, the cdc4-1 mutation does not affect MET25 repression and conversely, the MET30-1 mutation does not affect Cln2 degradation. Although Cdc4 appears not to mediate Cln2 degradation under the experimental conditions employed here, Cdc4 does interact weakly with Cln2 (Skowrya et al. 1997), so a role for Cdc4 in Cln degradation should not yet be excluded. The growth defects caused by high level expression of CDC4, GRR1 or MET30 in various SCF mutants suggests that different F-box proteins may be in equilibrium with a limiting amount of the E2/E3 core complex. If this is so, then F-box proteins may themselves be subject to stringent regulation. The decreased abundance of Cdc4 and Met30 in Skp1 temperature sensitive strains is consistent with this possibility, as is the regulation of Grr1 abundance by glucose (Li and Johnston 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> It is likely that other SCF complexes regulate yet other processes in yeast. A possible G2 function is suggested by the G2 arrest phenotype of Skp1-12 cells (Bai et al. 1996), and by interactions of Skp1 with the Cbf3 kinetochore complex (Connelly and Hieter 1996; Stemmann and Lechner 1996). Finally, because yeast contains two Cdc53 homologs and one Skp1 homolog, orthologous SCF pathways may also exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Substrates of SCF Complexes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> To date, only Sic1 has been unequivocally identified as a direct target for ubiquitination by a SCF complex. Reconstitution of phosphorylation dependent Sic1 ubiquitination has been achieved in vitro, in both a yeast extract system and in a purified system with recombinant proteins (Verma et al. 1997, Skowrya et al. 1997; Feldman et al. 1997). Strong circumstantial evidence suggests that, in addition to Sic1, SCF<highlight><superscript>Cdc4 </superscript></highlight>also targets Fab, Cdc6 and Gcn4 for degradation (Henchoz et al. 1997; McKinney and Cross 1994; Piatti et al. 1996; D. Kornitzer, personal communication). Although ubiquitination of Cln1/2 has not yet been reconstituted, SCF<highlight><superscript>Grr1 </superscript></highlight>specifically binds to phosphorylated Cln1/2, consistent with Grr1-dependent degradation of Cln1/2 in vivo (Skowyra et al., 1997). Genetic analysis suggests that a negative regulator of glucose repressed genes called Rgt1 could be a possible target of the SCF<highlight><superscript>Grr1 </superscript></highlight>complex (Erickson and Johnston 1994; Vallier et al. 1994). However, it is not known if Rgt1 physically interacts with Grr1, nor if Rgt1 is regulated by ubiquitin dependent proteolysis. The requirement for SCF<highlight><superscript>Met30 </superscript></highlight>function in methionine repression implicates ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Because Met30 forms a complex with the transactivator Met4, it is possible that Met30 targets Met4 for degradation, although other components of the Met4 transcriptional complex, Cbf1 and Met28, are also candidate targets (Kuras et al. 1996). The mechanisms whereby SCF complex activity is regulated in response to glucose and methionine are unknown, but could involve phosphorylation, subcellular localization, F-box protein abundance and complex assembly (Li and Johnston 1997; Pause et al. 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> SCF Complexes in Other Species </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> SCF complexes have recently emerged as key regulators in other organisms. In <highlight><italic>S. pombe, </italic></highlight>a Cdc4 homolog, pop1, controls the initiation of S phase by targeting the Cdk inhibitor rum1 and the Cdc6 homolog cdc18 for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (Kominami and Toda 1997). In <highlight><italic>C. elegans, </italic></highlight>null mutants of a Cdc53 homolog called Cul-1 cause hyperplasia in all tissues, suggesting that it too may target activators of division for degradation (Kipreos et al. 1996). In human cells, Skp1 binds to cyclin A-Cdk2 through its associated F-box protein, Skp2, (Zhang et al. 1995) and also forms a specific complex with human Cul-1 (Y. Xiong, personal communication). Another human cullin, Cul-2, physically associates with the VHL tumour suppressor protein, and may thus also regulate cell proliferation (Pause et al. 1997). As in yeast, degradation of mammalian G1 cyclins and Cdk inhibitors is phosphorylation and ubiquitin dependent (Clurman et al. 1996; Won and Reed 1996; Diehl et al. 1997; Sheaff et al. 1997) and so it will be of prime importance to determine the role of SCF complexes in these pathways. The control of gene expression by proteolysis is now well documented in several systems (Pahl and Baeuerle 1996), and by analogy to glucose and methionine regulation in yeast, SCF complexes may prove to be general transcriptional regulators. Indeed, the Met30 homologs Scon2/SconB and the Skp1 homolog SconC regulate sulfur metabolism in other fungi (Natorff et al. 1993; Kumar and Paietta 1995), suggesting that control of methionine biosynthesis by SCF complexes may be conserved. As metazoans contain at least six Cdc53 homologs (Kipreos et al. 1996), and as SCF complexes control multiple processes in yeast, it is likely that analogous SCF complexes will have both cell cycle and non-cell cycle functions in higher species. The combinatorial control of SCF ubiquitin-ligase complexes provides an adaptable regulatory system that controls cell function through ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Identification of a Skp1 Binding Region in the Cdc53 Protein of the Budding Yeast <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight></heading>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Amino acids 9-280 of the Cdc53 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been shown to be necessary for association with Skp1 (Patton et al, 1998 Genes Dev. 12:692). Similar experiments have narrowed the region necessary for the Cdc53/Skp1 interaction to amino acids 9 to 99 of Cdc53. The amino acid sequence of this region of Cdc53 was aligned with other Cdc53 cullin homologues (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). The amino acids corresponding to tyrosine (Y) 48 and methionine (M) 49 in Cdc53 were absolutely conserved in a subset of homologues more closely related to Cdc53 but not present in any of the other more distantly related homologues (with the exception of Y50 in C3A11.08 in <highlight><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic></highlight>). These two amino acids in Cdc53 were mutated by Kunkel mutagenesis to tryptophan (W) and glutamic acid (E) respectively, the homologous residues in <highlight><italic>Caenorhabditus elegans </italic></highlight>Cul-3. Five independent TRP1 plasmid isolates (pMT1939-1943) of this mutagenesis reaction, as well as a plasmid carrying a wild type CDC53 gene (pMT843), were transformed into a CDC53 &ldquo;shuffle strain&rdquo; (strain Mty1243, genotype ura3 trp1 leu2 his3 ade2 cdc53::ADE2&lt;CDC53<highlight><superscript>HA3 </superscript></highlight>URA3 CEN6 ARSH4&gt;). These mutant and wild type CDC53 genes were tagged with a MYC<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>epitope. These strains were grown on complete minimal medium agar plates containing 1 g/L of 5-fluoroorotic acid, which kills cells that produce Ura3, thus killing any cells that do not lose the &lt;CDC53<highlight><superscript>HA3 </superscript></highlight>URA3&gt; plasmid. None of the five CDC53-Y48W,M49E<highlight><superscript>MYC6 </superscript></highlight>mutants conferred viability on the shuffle strain, while the wild type CDC53<highlight><superscript>MYC6 </superscript></highlight>did. Cells containing either the wild type CDC53<highlight><superscript>MYC</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>or one of three isolates of the mutant CDC53<highlight><superscript>MYC6 </superscript></highlight>were grown to late-log phase (2&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml), harvested, washed, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 50M NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT) plus protease inhibitors, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground into a powder under liquid nitrogen. This powder was thawed, spun to remove cellullar debris, and cleared by spinning in an ultracentrifuge. Protein concentration in the lysate was adjusted to 24 mg/ml in a volume of 1.25 ml lysis buffer &plus;10 mM N-ethyl maleimide, for a final mass of 30 mg protein for each strain. 25 &mgr;l of a 50% slurry in lysis buffer of protein-A beads (Pierce) cross-linked with dimethyl suberimidate to the anti-MYC monoclonal antibody 9E10 was added to each lysate, incubated with gentle rocking at 4&deg; C. for several hours, washed several times with lysis buffer, aspirated, resuspended in protein sample buffer, and run on two 10% polyacrylamide gels. One gel was transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and western blotted with anti-MYC, anti-Cdc34, and anti-Skp1 antibodies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>). The mutant Cdc53 still binds to Cdc34 but not to Skp1. The second gel was silver stained (see W. Wray et al. 1981, Anal. Biochem. 118:197) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference>). A number of bands that are present in the Cdc53<highlight><superscript>MYC6 </superscript></highlight>immunoprecipitation disappear in the Cdc53-Y48W, M<highlight><subscript>49</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><superscript>MYC6 </superscript></highlight>immunoprecipitation. </paragraph>
