<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A fingerprint entry and engine starting system including a computerized video recorder, and transmitter installed in a driver&apos;s door of a vehicle housing a transparent shield. The recorder is perpendicular via position under this transparent shield. Since this shield is installed in the vehicle&apos;s door handle, a legal user will press the shield upon its left side portion, such as to start the vehicle&apos;s engine. As a result, whenever the righthand portion upon the shield is pushed by a legal user, the vehicle&apos;s door-locks are freed. This is done when the recorder is actuated whereas a fingerprint of a user is transformed from optical information to computer data when the shield is pressed. This data is transmitted and compared with preset data, such that when this preset data stored in a memory matches with transformed data, coils via actuators for releasing the vehicle&apos;s door-locks are actuated. An ignition switch actuates a motor of an engine starter also, as a match is defined, which drives the starter and starts the engine of the vehicle. This is accomplished, when an activating signal is outputted from a CPU. This CPU defines the memory whereby outputting the activating signal only, whenever the shield is pushed by a legal user for actuating two pushbutton switches. Four fingerprint input pushbutton switches outwardly upon the door causes one power window, a heater, a trunk and a hood to be operated also, before entering the vehicle without a key. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> include a column defined by a reference numeral <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which prohibits a conventional ignition lock LP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The column <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> conceals a conventional ignition switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, so as to prevent theft of a vehicle. This also prevents the use of a mechanical key. E.g., the ignition switch and its lines are thus, controlled via fingerprint input through an optical system, and is transformed to computer data, or a fingerprint signal. As this signal is transmitted, compared, and matched with one preset signal, outputs an activating control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With respect to the detailed description of a First embodiment, the present invention will be discussed according to the preferred embodiments. Since there are drawings about the above brief description of the several views, these views will be referred to by specifying the numbers of the figures. The reference to these drawings shall be defined by different parts by use of reference letters or numerals (preferably the latter). This specification will conclude with seventeen new claims, particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter, which the applicant regards as his invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, and chiefly, to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, an input system being shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is for inputting fingerprint input into an optical system which is transformed into computer data, or a signal by an image sensor, outputs a fingerprint signal as a LED illuminates a two part shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. A recorder R uses an automatic white balance recording system for illuminating all fingerprints to be recorded, also. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This video recorder R, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is made up about a lens Z, and a pickup device, as a solid state image sensor (MOS, or CCD). The sensor views the fingerprint input, so that when the input is transformed to an electronic signal, a receiving system <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> receives the signal via a transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as a pushbutton <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is pushed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B, the recorder R is positioned, so that its MACRO lens Z (FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) is adjacently below the input shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> regarding an automatic focusing system. This system measures the distance from the bottom of the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> while emitting infrared rays, beneath this shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, detects real fingerprint input as the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is pressed. Now this approves utilization principles of triangulation modes, since infrared rays from an infrared light emitting is shot through a protecting lens to the fingerprint input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The fingerprint input is hit, and the infrared rays reflect back through a receiving lens as entering the sensor. Since the sensor defines two photodiodes, a signal processing automatic focus control system moves the receiving lens, such as to equalize the light intensity of the two photodiodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As a drive pulse generator circuit generates pulses for driving the image sensor and a signal-processing circuit, the fingerprint signal is outputted, as the fingerprint input is thereby inputted through the fingerprint shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. While this image sensor picks up the fingerprint input and feeds it into the signal-processing circuit, this fingerprint input is thereby generated into the fingerprint signal with respect to the signal processing circuit, and associated components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> After describing the processing of this fingerprint signal, the embodiment will now be described in detail below. A first unit switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is activated beneath the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> via a door handle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>. A second unit switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is setoff also, as the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is pushed when inputting a real fingerprint. The transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> keeps the fingerprint signal in a fingerprint memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> when the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> has ben pushed. A driver&apos;s door <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> conceals this transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and the video recorder R whereby, defined as the input system including the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has an antenna <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to transmit, and receive radio signals as the transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is setoff. A modem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is included for demodulating received unit signals, and produces output signals so as to be transmitted about the source of the fingerprint input thus inputted. A unit signal detector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is for detecting the unit signal demodulated from this modem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Further, a fingerprint signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is for, so receiving the fingerprint signal from the fingerprint memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The fingerprint signal is thereby, outputted from the fingerprint signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> up to the modem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, after the unit signal is detected. Lastly, a dispatcher oscillator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is to output a dispatcher signal due to the course of this fingerprint signal being transmitted via this transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As a rule, a controller <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> within a vehicle defines the antennas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> all of which are provided such as to transmit, and receive radio signals using this transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A modem <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> demodulates signals received so as to produce output signals to be transmitted to the transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, thus, regarding the laws by which the unit signals are transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An oscillator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is included to output a dispatcher signal, one CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A to control a fingerprint system, a memory <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for storing a preset fingerprint signal, and whenever this fingerprint signal matches with the preset fingerprint signal being determined, thereby the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A, a transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is now triggered. A coil of a relay <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is hot by this transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being turned on. Further, this relay <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is connected to many automotive devices, such as a door-lock device, trunk opener, usual power windows, heater, hood opener, and a steering lock device. A coil <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of an actuator is for freeing a door-lock, only of a user&apos;s seat section and a coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of an actuator is for freeing a door-lock of a commuter seat section, since the steering locks via a timer, only, when the vehicle is parked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Now, a coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> regarding an actuator is for causing the LED to, thereby, provide illumination for the fingerprint input shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when the relay <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is hot both door-locks are freed and the LED is activated, since the unit switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is connected to the input terminal of this CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. As the switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is joined to the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A and is setoff via the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, a path is provided by which current flows, thus, concerning a resistor R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Now, the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A can compare the tracing extremity of the input fingerprint signal induced as the unit switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is set off, i.e. for fingerprint entry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to the first embodiment, this fingerprint operated ignition switch system will now be described in more detail by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B and a</cross-reference> step-by-step flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Step <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the unit switch <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is setoff, as the input shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is inputted with real fingerprints by a user. Step <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the unit signal is transmitted from the antennas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to the antenna <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is found in the secured transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. This transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and the recorder R are turned on via the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> setting off the unit switches <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Since the unit signal is received by the antenna <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> about the transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the unit signal detector <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> detects the unit signal, as the fingerprint signal is probed from the fingerprint memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to the fingerprint signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In step number <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> the fingerprint signal is outputted from the fingerprint signal generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> up to the modem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Besides, the modem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> receives a dispatcher wave which is produced via the dispatcher oscillator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This overlays this fingerprint signal via the dispatcher wave for forming a radio signal, so that the fingerprint signal travels upon the dispatcher wave. Whenever the modem <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> transmits the fingerprint signal by the antenna <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to these antennas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the preset signal is studded out from the fingerprint memory <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. In step <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A utilizes the memory <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and compares the fingerprint signal from the transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> using the antennas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> with the preset fingerprint signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, when the fingerprint signal matches with this preset fingerprint signal, the transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is actuated in step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, as the relay <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is hot such that the current flows via the coils <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> concerning the LED, this triggers the door-locks, as this LED emits light. Now when a match is not decisively defined by the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A about these fingerprint signals, the fingerprint system returns to a starting status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> These door-locks are triggered while this LED emits light, when a legal user inputs true fingerprints through two triggers <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> by the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. This unlocks the door <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> such that a user can enter the vehicle. In step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, this transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is deactivated through the timer, which is activated, and starts clocking a prearranged time, when such, prearranged time has ended which is roughly, 25-30 seconds in step <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Briefly in process of time the foregoing LED and the actuators are turned off as well. The steering lock is thus, released only, as a user inputs real fingerprints through the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> such that the engine triggers <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> is pressed. This causes an engine starter to be driven, when the triggers <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> set off the first unit switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A outputs a commandment signal as the fingerprint signal mates the preset fingerprint signal stored in the memory <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The vehicle now will be referred to as &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; with respect to a reference name concerning this unique invention, which is presented to applicant from (GOD). Now, a starter motor SM (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) for causing this engine starter to be driven is activated via the commandment signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the starter motor SM is, thus, connected to the switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as the recorder R is provided with an adaptor (ADA) so as to connect to a 12 V DC source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, one output cable <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is connected via the input terminal of the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. Since two leads <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are connected to the starter motor SM, as leads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>A each of which is connected via the 12 V DC source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, all remaining leads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>A each of which is coupled with respect to this unit switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The recorder R can be operated from the ADA or will charge up its batteries while recording fingerprint input, since the 12 V DC power supply voltage via &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; is lowered, or raised according to the operating voltage concerning the recorder R. As the switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A, the antennas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> will transmit the unit signal to the transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, as the engine triggers <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> of the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is pressed upon the pushbutton <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This causes the starter motor SM to drive the starter via the commandment signal, since the transmitter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> answers the unit signal by transmitting the fingerprint signal. A resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided on the switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the same manner, as set forth above about modification, one transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided also. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An ignition (IGN) switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> shown via <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> about a locking portion LP, as shown via <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is, only, turned on when a match is determined by the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. Thus, the starter motor SM is actuated and a starter relay <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is hot, only when a match is determined by the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A, since the transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is for starting &ldquo;EZEKIEL&apos;S&rdquo; engine, when the relay <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is hot. As a result, via this construction, the commandment signal is outputted, then 12 V DC electric current concerning &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; flows through the ignition switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> from the 12 V DC source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, when a match is compared and determined by the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Now, this activates this ignition switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, which triggers the starter motor SM, as set forth in the foregoing, thus, concerning the prearranged time about the modification. Now, the transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned off, such that the operation returns to a starting position, since the recorder R includes a rewind feature, so, as to bring its tape back to a starting position before being turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 8</cross-reference> regarding &ldquo;EZEKIEL,&rdquo; the transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is engineered to start &ldquo;EZEKIEL&apos;S&rdquo; engine, when the foundations about the transistors Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are thereby, connected to the output terminals of this CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. Now, this adjacent transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is for thereby freeing the door-locks, while this starter motor SM, the IGN switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, and an (ACC) accessories A, such, as a clock, power windows, radio, or the like are actuated only, when the transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turn on and a coil of the relay <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is hot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The collector via the transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the hot coil of the relay <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. This collector is connected to a collector bias source Vcc of the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. Now, the emitter of the transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is grounded, and an end of the coils <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> via actuators for unlocking the doors of &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; is, thus, connected to a line of the collector bias source Vcc as the opposite end is grounded by the relay <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As the transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is energized, the coil of this relay <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is hot, such that electric current flows through the coils <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which unlocks &ldquo;EZEKIEL&apos;S&rdquo; doors. Thus, the collector of the transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the coil about the relay <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the collector is connected to the collector bias source Vcc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The emitter of the transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is grounded, and a line of the coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of actuator, such, as to cause the engine starter to be driven is coupled to this collector bias source Vcc, while the other leads are grounded through the relay <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The LED is connected via this collector bias source Vcc, whereby the other leads are grounded using the relay <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As the transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is actuated from legal fingerprint input and a match is defined, the coil of the relay <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is hot, such that electric current flows through the coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and the LED. The internal combustion engine of &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; is started as the LED illuminates this fingerprint input system via the door <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the door handle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as the triggers <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> are pressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Further, when the engine trigger <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> is pressed by a legal user, when the engine is functioning and &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; is parked, the commandment signal is outputted from the CPU <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A. As a result, this commandment signal triggers an off position about an on/off load of the ignition switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, which, thus, turns off the engine of &ldquo;EZEKIEL.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> This second embodiment includes different reference numerals and letters except for, whenever comparable elements are used from the first embodiment regarding the modification herein, with respect to all corresponding elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the second embodiment having an input dashboard shield switch <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, its enter, delete and (ACC) fingerprint switches <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and A for performing each operation as follows: the fingerprint input pushbutton shield switch <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is to be triggered by a user for turning on a video recorder J (not shown), which is in &ldquo;EZEKIEL&apos;S&rdquo; dashboard for changing optical information to computer data, so as to start the engine of &ldquo;EZEKIEL.&rdquo; This fingerprint enter input switch <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is for entering data of a transit user into the fingerprint operated IGN switch system. Now the fingerprint input delete switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is for deleting this data of a transit user, and the ACC switch A actuates the accessories which are controlled by the IGN switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, conventionally, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a more affordable system has an input pushbutton LOW BUDGET SHIELD SWITCH (LS). The switch LS has a fingerprint shield secured in the vehicle &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; upon the door <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, such, as to input fingerprint data optically through the system by the recorder R. As a result, the engine of &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; is started as set forth above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> With respect to this construction, the input shield switch LS is to be setoff while being pushed by a legal user, actuates the recorder R in the same manner, as when the input shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is being pressed. Generally, this shield switch <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> including this recorder J, consequently, is excluded from all vehicles employing the LS system since the input computerized video recorder R, thus, provides fingerprint entry and engine starting prudently. Besides, the column <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> conceals this IGN switch <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> (not shown), however omitting the extended locking portion LP, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The input shield LS, its enter, delete and ACC push button switches <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and A are adjacent close range shooting, however, above the recorder R, and in the same manner, as the shield switch <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and its auxiliary input pushbutton switches. The shield LS is only in vehicles omitting the switch <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and this shield <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is, only, in vehicles excluding the shield LS, since &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; defines a controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> about the fingerprint operated IGN switch system, such, as to control ten switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the door <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a hood, trunk, heater and window fingerprint push-button system outwardly above the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to input data. The fingerprint input is recorded through a clear inward structure, when each pushbutton control is pressed, actuates four switches. E.g., one hood switch HO actuates the hood opener, one switch TS is for triggering the trunk opener, one switch HS is for turning on the heater, and one switch WS is for operating this window control before entering through &ldquo;EZEKIEL&apos;S&rdquo; remote door <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, one fingerprint video image converter (FVI) converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is for, thereby converting signals outputted, which are produced while fingerprint input is inputted through the recorders J and R for setting off all switches from <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight> to A. An OR-gate circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is, such that a logical amount of input signals are thereby, generated from the (FVI) convertor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a video pattern generator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes a clock for driving a counter chain. Besides, this addresses a preprogrammed video pattern memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (PVPM) for generating a video waveform. Now this outputs address signals regarding the output signals from the FVI convertor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and this memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Further, this controller <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a comparator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so as to compare all output signals characterizing data from the FVI convertor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Now, when all output signals characterized by data from this memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are outputted, a high-level logic signal is outputted also, when the output signal from the FVI convertor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> matches the output from the output signal within this memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A video negative viewer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> inverts the video of the fingerprint input, while producing a negative image on the video of the fingerprint signal, so as to match with this output signal from the memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A D type reset S flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is set by the output signal via the video negative viewer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This outputs the commandment signal so as to turn on a transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, as a timer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is to time a preset time by which the flipflop circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outputs the commandment signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When the preset time is ended on this timer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is turned off, and a one shot multi-vibrator <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is actuated. The flipflop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is reset via this transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> being turned off, and a retriggerable multivibrator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is now activated in reply to the output signal of the OR-gate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A one-shot multi-vibrator <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is for outputting one pulse signal about this preset time of the tracing extremity via an output signal thus, of the multi-vibrator <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. As the one-shot multi vibrato <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> resets the video negative viewer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> thus utilizing the OR-gate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, when the preset time is ended, an AND-gate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> circuit is included which produces an output that is logical. A delay circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is to delay the output signal via this AND gate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> about this preset time. Thus, an OR-gate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> produces a logical amount of input signals from the output of this one shot multi-vibrator <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, thereby, including the output of this delay circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Moreover, when the video pattern generator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> outputs an address signal figurative about the fingerprint signal outputted from the FVI convertor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a high level logic signal is outputted by the AND-gate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as the delay circuit <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so receives the high-level logic signal. This is also, received by the OR-gate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, and is accomplished only, when the preset time has ended. Now the video negative viewer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is reset, when the output signal via the OR-gate <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is outputted. Electric current flows by the coils <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the LED via a relay <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, when the transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is set-off for answering the output signal from the flipflop circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the input fingerprint pushbutton controls located on the outer door <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which, when inputted via a user, now, activates the hood opener, the trunk opener, the heater, and the window control system, whereby, this LED emits light. Door lock actuators are actuated regarding a switch <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> when its trigger <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> is inputted for providing fingerprint entry. The fingerprint input switches are setoff about the dashboard also. As the memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a system for storing data of a transit user, while a transit user presses the shield <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, a legal user presses the fingerprint enter pushbutton switch <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Each fingerprint input both of which becomes computer data by the image sensors, signal circuits and associated components. Now, this fingerprint data both of which are compared via the comparator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as set forth above, and when the output signal from this FVI convertor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> matches the output from the output signal of the memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a signal of a transit user is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Now, this flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outputs the commandment signal, after being set by the output signal from the video negative viewer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the commandment signal actuates the timer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. This timer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> starts clocking a preset time to delete the data of a transit user, as an image of the data of a legal user is generated via the viewer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> alone. While the input switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> deletes all transit data, the delete switch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, when pushed by a legal user deletes data about a preset time. The preset time to delete data of a transit user is 3 second, after the data about a legal user are generated via the video negative viewer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with respect to a singular negative image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When a user enters &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; by pressing the switch <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> about the door handle <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, outputs the fingerprint signal. The FVI converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> converts the fingerprint signal from the recorder R, which goes to this comparator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This signal is sent through the OR-gate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and further to the video pattern generator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The video pattern generator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> utilizes 43,605 pixels, such that each pixel can be programmed since a switch provides a choice of patterns such as a custom pattern of the fingerprint signal. This pattern generator <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> addresses this memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by an address signal in reply to fingerprint input, as a user operates this switch <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. Now, a preset signal is outputted from the memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the comparator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that the comparator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, thus, compares the fingerprint signal from the FVI converter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the preset fingerprint signal, and from the memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. When the fingerprint signal matches with this preset fingerprint signal, a twofold signal is outputted from this comparator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As the negative image of the fingerprint signal matches this preset fingerprint signal from the memory <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as the comparator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> outputs the preset signal, the video negative viewer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> outputs the commandment signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The commandment signal is outputted to the flipflop circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> since the flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is set on the basis of this commandment signal. This flip-flop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outputs a high level signal by a terminal Q to the bed of the transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, so that the transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is turned on, since the relay <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is hot, electric current flows by way of these coils <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and the LED. Now, the engine of &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; is started since a user pushed the input shield <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The fingerprint input enter and delete switches <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and this dashboard ACC switch A will perform each operation, while being operated by a legal user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Now when the LED emits light after being activated, the timer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> starts timing the prearranged time, as set forth in the foregoing. Besides, all of the foregoing controls are supported via five switches, as follows: <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and A regarding this construction. As the remaining input switches <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>, HO, TS, HS, WS, and the switches <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> to A are included as ten fingerprint input manual switches, the input switch LS is omitted. Since the construction of the switch LS includes ten switches, also, the shield switch <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> is excluded as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, an OR-gate circuit <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is connected to a S terminal of a flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, since the switches <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>-WS are connected by way of this OR-gate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. While the bases of the transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and a transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are connected to an output terminal of an AND gate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, the flip-flop <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is set by the output signal from the OR-gate <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. Now, the transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is for freeing the door-locks, as this transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is for starting the engine of &ldquo;EZEKIEL,&rdquo; and to energize the LED. Since the collectors of the transistors <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are connected to a hot coil of the relay <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and a coil about a relay <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the collectors are connected to a collector bias source Vcc, as the emitter of the transistors <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are grounded. As a lead via the coils <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of actuators for freeing these door-locks are connected to this collector bias source Vcc, the other lead is grounded via this relay <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. As a lead via the coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the LED is coupled to the collector bias source Vcc, the other lead is grounded via the relay <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As this output terminal Q via the flip-flop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and one output terminal Q to invert the flipflop circuit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> while connected to the two input terminals via the AND-gate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the two input terminals of the AND-gate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected to these output terminals Q of the flipflop circuits <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Thus, the high level signals are outputted from the output terminal Q, and the Q of the flipflop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to the AND-gate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> simultaneously, as the fingerprint signal matches via the preset fingerprint signal in reply to the fingerprint input switches <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, WS, HS, TS, and HO. An output signal is outputted from this AND-gate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, so that the transistor <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is turned on, as the relay <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is hot. Now, the door-locks are freed, as a legal user presses the trigger switch <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>. The switches HO to WS all of which will perform their operations, as set forth above by basis on modification of this remote construction. When a user inputs fingerprints through this engine trigger switch <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>, before entering this vehicle &ldquo;EZEKIEL,&rdquo; a legal user will, also input fingerprints using the shield switch LS while seated in the driver&apos;s seat. This is accomplished only when the fingerprint signal matches with the preset fingerprint signal, as the high-level logical signals from the output terminals Q via the flipflops <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are received by two input terminals about the AND-gate <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Also, as an input terminal of this AND-gate <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>_receives a low level logical signal from the output terminal Q via this flip flop <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Now the AND-gate <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> outputs an output signal to the transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to start the engine of &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; via the engine trigger switch <highlight><bold>2001</bold></highlight>. This LS shield switch will, also, start the engine of &ldquo;EZEKIEL&rdquo; about this AND-gate <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> for outputting an output signal to the transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as the LED emits light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> While the above description contains many specifics of which should not be construed, as limitations on the scope of the invention, many variations and modifications will thus be apparent to persons skilled in the art. E.g., fingerprint banking is defined by a computer specialist, which can occupy a room with computers. The room can be designed, so that the computerist can view all windows opened for service, when the direct handling of money received or paid out with respect to deposits, and withdrawals are such that a fingerprint banking calculator is to be utilized. On the other hand, any account holder can calculate any amount of which is so requested, and then, press a fingerprint banking shield, which will energize an electric transmitter and a video recorder, simultaneously. The recorder will record the account holder&apos;s fingerprints as this transmitter transmits a signal about them to a memory in which a computer via the foregoing room analyzes. While this transmitted fingerprint signal matches with one preset signal stored in the memory, this account holder&apos;s account number on a faxed bank statement is provided for the account holder, as this computerist views all evidence on the computer&apos;s screen. The invention will provide fingerprint entry in condominiums, housing developments, homes, apartment houses and businesses. Now twenty four hour fingerprint banking can be provided, and an ACC input switch, a radio and compact disc CD switch, also can be provided on the outer door regarding fingerprint input via this &ldquo;Broadening paragraph&rdquo; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions Proverbs. A construction as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>B can substitute or replace the construction shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, since each of those constructions both of which are water proof. </paragraph>
