<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an L-glutamine producing bacterium belonging to coryneform bacteria and a method for producing L-glutamine. L-Glutamine is an industrially useful amino acid as an ingredient of seasonings, liver function promoting agents, amino acid transfusions, comprehensive amino acid preparations and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to produce L-amino acids by fermentation, methods for improving microorganisms by breeding have been used abundantly. That is, since production ability of wild strains per se for L-amino acid production is extremely low in many cases, there have been known methods of imparting auxotrophy or analogue resistance by mutation or imparting mutation for metabolic regulation and methods utilizing a combination of these. Although L-glutamine can be obtained with an appropriate yield by the aforementioned methods, it is indispensable to further improve the fermentation yield in order to industrially produce L-glutamine at a low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, the L-glutamine fermentation also suffers from the problem of by-production of L-glutamic acid. A method for solving this problem is proposed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (Kokai) No. 3-232497. Although the production of L-glutamic acid can be suppressed to a certain extent by this method, there is still by-production of L-glutamic acid and the yield of L-glutamine is insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Since such improvements of L-glutamine producing bacteria as mentioned above utilize methods of treating a host bacterium with a mutagenizing agent or the like and selecting a strain showing improved productivity for L-glutamine from bacteria randomly incorporated with mutations, they require much labor and suffer from difficulties. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to find characteristics of coryneform bacteria providing improvement of L-glutamine productivity and suppression of by-production of L-glutamic acid, and thereby provide a method for producing L-glutamine utilizing a strain having such characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present invention assiduously studied in order to achieve the aforementioned object. As a result, they found that a strain of coryneform bacterium of which intracellular glutamine synthetase activity was enhanced showed more excellent L-glutamine producing ability and could markedly suppress the by-production of L-glutamic acid compared with strains showing the glutamine synthetase activity comparable to that of wild strains. Further, they found that production rate of L-glutamine was improved by simultaneously enhancing glutamine synthetase activity and glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, they successfully isolated a novel gene coding for glutamine synthetase and a novel gene coding for glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase, and thus accomplished the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, &ldquo;L-glutamine producing ability&rdquo; means an ability to accumulate L-glutamine in a medium, when the coryneform bacterium of the present invention is cultured in the medium. This L-glutamine producing ability may be possessed by the bacterium as a property of a wild strain of coryneform bacteria or may be imparted or enhanced by breeding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> For imparting or enhancing the L-glutamine producing ability by breeding, there can be used the method of isolation of 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine resistant strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 3-232497), the method of isolation of purine analogue resistant and/or methionine sulfoxide resistant strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-202694), the method of isolation of &agr;-ketomalonic acid resistant strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 56-151495), the method of imparting resistance to a peptide containing glutamic acid (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2-186994) and so forth. As specific examples of coryneform bacteria having L-glutamine producing ability, the following strains can be mentioned. <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>AJ11573 (FERM P-5492, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 56-151495) <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>AJ12210 (FERM P-8123, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-202694) <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>AJ12212 (FERM P-8123, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-202694) <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>AJ12418 (FERM-BP2205, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2-186994) <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>DH18 (FERM P-11116, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 3-232497) <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium melassecola </italic></highlight>DH344 (FERM P-11117, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 3-232497) <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>AJ11574 (FERM P-5493, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. No. 56 151495) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;modified so that intracellular glutamine synthetase (henceforth also referred to as &ldquo;GS&rdquo;) activity should be enhanced&rdquo; means that the GS activity per cell has become higher than that of a non-modified strain, for example, a wild-type coryneform bacterium. For example, there can be mentioned a case where number of GS molecules per cell increases, a case where GS specific activity per GS molecule increases and so forth. Further, as a wild-type coryneform bacterium that serves as an object for comparison, for example, the <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>ATCC 14067 can be mentioned. As a result of enhancement of intracellular GS activity, there are obtained an effect that the amount of L-glutamine accumulation in a medium increases, an effect that the by-production of L-glutamic acid decreases and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Enhancement of GS activity in a coryneform bacterium cell can be attained by enhancement of expression of a gene coding for GS. Increase of the expression amount of the gene can be attained by increasing copy number of the gene coding for GS. For example, a recombinant DNA can be prepared by ligating a gene fragment coding for GS with a vector functioning in the bacterium, preferably a multi-copy type vector, and introduced into a host having L-glutamine producing ability to transform it. Alternatively, the aforementioned recombinant DNA can be introduced into a wild-type coryneform bacterium to obtain a transformant, and then the transformant can be imparted with L-glutamine producing ability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As the GS gene, any of genes derived from coryneform bacteria and genes derived from other organisms such as bacteria belonging to the genus Escherichia can be used. Among these, genes derived from coryneform bacteria are preferred in view of ease of expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As the gene coding for GS of coryneform bacteria, glnA has already been elucidated (<highlight><italic>FEMS Microbiology Letters, </italic></highlight>81-88, 154, 1997). Therefore, a GS gene can be obtained by PCR (polymerase chain reaction; refer to White, T. J. et al., <highlight><italic>Trends Genet., </italic></highlight>5, 185 (1989)) utilizing primers prepared based on the nucleotide sequence of the gene, for example, the primers mentioned in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 4 and 5, and chromosomal DNA of coryneform bacterium as a template. Genes coding for GS of other microorganisms can be obtained in a similar manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The chromosomal DNA can be prepared from a bacterium, which is a DNA donor, by the method of Saito and Miura (refer to H. Saito and K. Miura, <highlight><italic>Biochem. Biophys. Acta, </italic></highlight>72, 619 (1963), Text for Bioengineering Experiments, Edited by the Society for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan, pp.97-98, Baifukan, 1992), for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, an isozyme often exists for an enzyme involved in an amino acid biosynthesis system. The inventors of the present invention successfully isolated and cloned a gene coding for an isozyme of GS of coryneform bacteria by utilizing homology with respect to the nucleotide sequence of the aforementioned g1nA gene. This gene is referred to as &ldquo;g1nA2&rdquo;. The process for obtaining it will be described later. g1nA2 as well as g1nA can be used for enhancement of the GS activity of coryneform bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> If the GS gene amplified by the PCR method is ligated to a vector DNA autonomously replicable in a cell of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>and/or coryneform bacteria to prepare a recombinant DNA and this is introduced into <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></highlight>, subsequent procedures become easy. Examples of the vector autonomously replicable in a cell of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coil </italic></highlight>include pUC19, pUC18, pHSG299, pHSG399, pHSG398, RSF1010, pBR322, pACYC184, pMW219 and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A vector that functions in coryneform bacteria means, for example, a plasmid that can autonomously replicate in coryneform bacteria. Specific examples thereof include the followings. pAM330 (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 58-67699) pHM1519 (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 58-77895) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if a DNA fragment having an ability to make a plasmid autonomously replicable in coryneform bacteria is taken out from these vectors and inserted into the aforementioned vectors for <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></highlight>, they can be used as a so-called shuttle vector autonomously replicable in both of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>and coryneform bacteria. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> These vectors can be obtained from the deposited microorganisms as follows. That is, microbial cells collected in their exponential growth phase are lysed by using lysozyme and SDS, and centrifuged at 30000&times;g. The supernatant obtained from the lysate is added with polyethylene glycol, fractionated and purified by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In order to prepare a recombinant DNA by ligating a GS gene and a vector that can function in a cell of coryneform bacterium, a vector is digested with a restriction enzyme corresponding to the terminus of the gene containing the GS gene. Ligation is usually performed by using a ligase such as T4 DNA ligase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> To introduce the recombinant DNA prepared as described above into a microorganism, any known transformation methods that have hitherto been reported can be employed. For instance, employable are a method of treating recipient cells with calcium chloride so as to increase the permeability of DNA, which has been reported for <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>K-12 (Mandel, M. and Higa, A., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>53, 159 (1970)), and a method of preparing competent cells from cells which are at the growth phase followed by introducing the DNA thereinto, which has been reported for <highlight><italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic></highlight>(Duncan, C. H., Wilson, G. A. and Young, F. E., <highlight><italic>Gene, </italic></highlight>1, 153 (1977)). In addition to these, also employable is a method of making DNA-recipient cells into protoplasts or spheroplasts, which can easily take up recombinant DNA, followed by introducing the recombinant DNA into the cells, which is known to be applicable to <highlight><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic></highlight>, actinomycetes and yeasts (Chang, S. and Choen, S. N., <highlight><italic>Molec. Gen. Genet., </italic></highlight>168, 111 (1979); Bibb, M. J., Ward, J. M. and Hopwood, O. A., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>274, 398 (1978); Hinnen, A., Hicks, J. B. and Fink, G. R., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>75, 1929 (1978)). The transformation of coryneform bacteria can also be performed by the electric pulse method (Sugimoto et al., Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-207791). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Increase of copy number of GS gene can also be achieved by introducing multiple copies of the GS gene into chromosomal DNA of coryneform bacteria. In order to introduce multiple copies of the GS gene into chromosomal DNA of coryneform bacteria, homologous recombination is carried out by using a sequence whose multiple copies exist in the chromosomal DNA as targets. As sequences whose multiple copies exist in the chromosomal DNA, repetitive DNA, inverted repeats existing at the end of a transposable element can be used. Also, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-109985, it is possible to incorporate the GS gene into transposon, and allow it to be transferred to introduce multiple copies of the gene into the chromosomal DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Enhancement of the GS activity can also be attained by, besides being based on the aforementioned gene amplification, replacing an expression control sequence of the GS gene on chromosomal DNA or plasmid, such as a promoter, with a stronger one. For example, lac promoter, trp promoter, trc promoter and so forth are known as strong promoters. Moreover, it is also possible to introduce nucleotide substitution for several nucleotides into a promoter region for the GS gene so that it should be modified into a stronger one, as disclosed in International Patent Publication WO00/18935. By such substitution or modification of promoter, expression of the GS gene is enhanced and thus GS activity is enhanced. Such modification of expression control sequence may be combined with the increase of copy number of the GS gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The substitution of expression control sequence can be performed, for example, in the same manner as the gene substitution using a temperature sensitive plasmid described later. Examples of the temperature sensitive plasmid of coryneform bacteria include p48K, pSFKT2 (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2000-262288 for the both), pHSC4 (refer to France Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2667875, 1992 and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 5-7491) and so forth. These plasmids can at least autonomously replicate at a temperature of 25&deg; C., but cannot autonomously replicate at a temperature of 37&deg; C. in coryneform bacteria. Although pSFKT2 was used for the substitution for the promoter sequence of the GDH gene in the example mentioned later, gene substitution can be performed in a similar manner by using pHSC4 instead of pSFKT2. <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>AJ12571 harboring pHSC4 was deposited on Oct. 11, 1990 at the National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry (currently, the independent administrative corporation, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, International Patent Organism Depositary (Chuo Dai-6, 1-1 Higashi 1-Chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, Japan, postal code: 305-8566)), and received an accession number of FERM P-11763. Then, it was transferred to an international deposit under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on Aug. 26, 1991, and received an accession number of FERM BP-3524. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Enhancement of the GS activity can be attained also by deficiency in regulation by the adenylylation of intracellular GS, besides based on the increase of expression amount of the GS gene described above. GS changes into an inactive form by adenylylation of a tyrosine residue in the amino acid sequence (<highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>642-649, (58) 1967; <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>3769-3771, (243) 1968). Therefore, by defect of this adenylylation of GS, the intracellular GS activity can be enhanced. The defect of adenylylation used herein means not only substantially complete deregulation by the adenylylation but also such reduction of the adenylylation that the intracellular GS activity should be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The adenylylation of GS is generally performed by adenylyl transferase (<highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>1703-1710, (58) 1967). It has been suggested that, in coryneform bacteria, the 405th tyrosine residue of the glnA gene product, which is represented by the sequence of Genebank accession Y13221, is adenylylated (FEMS Microbiology Letters, 303-310, 1999 (173)). This inactivation by the adenylylation of GS can be defected by introducing a mutation into the glnA gene so that the tyrosine residue should be replaced with another amino acid residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Further, the inactivation of GS by the adenylylation can also be defected by reducing the activities of intracellular glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase (ATase). Although adenylyl transferase of coryneform bacteria had been unknown, the inventors of the present invention successfully isolated a gene coding for adenylyl transferase of coryneform bacteria, glnE. The process therefor will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> To reduce the intracellular ATase activity of coryneform bacteria, there can be used, for example, a method of treating the coryneform bacteria by ultraviolet irradiation or with a mutagenizing agent used for usual mutagenesis treatment such as N-methyl-N&prime;-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) or a nitrous acid and selecting a mutant strain in which the ATase activity is reduced. Coryneform bacteria having reduced ATase activity can also be obtained by gene disruption, besides the mutagenesis treatment. That is, a coryneform bacterium can be transformed with a DNA containing a glnE gene modified with deletion of partial sequence of the gene coding for ATase so as not to produce ATase functioning normally (deletion type glnE gene), so that recombination between the deletion type glnE gene and the glnE gene on the chromosome should occur to disrupt the glnE gene on the chromosome. Such gene disruption by gene substitution utilizing homologous recombination has already been established, and there are methods utilizing a linear DNA, a plasmid that contains a temperature sensitive replication origin and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A glnE gene on host chromosome can be replaced with the deletion type glnE gene, for example, as follows. That is, a recombinant DNA is prepared by inserting a temperature sensitive replication origin, a mutant glnE gene and a marker gene for resistance to a drug such as chloramphenicol, and a coryneform bacterium is transformed with the recombinant DNA. Further, the transformant is cultured at a temperature at which the temperature sensitive replication origin does not function, and then the transformant strain can be cultured in a medium containing the drug to obtain a transformant strain in which the recombinant DNA is incorporated into the chromosomal DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In such a strain in which recombinant DNA is incorporated into chromosomal DNA as described above, the mutant glnE gene is recombined with the glnE gene originally present on the chromosome, and the two fusion genes of the chromosomal glnE gene and the deletion type glnE gene are inserted into the chromosome so that the other portions of the recombinant DNA (vector segment, temperature sensitive replication origin and drug resistance marker) should be present between the two fusion genes. Therefore, the transformant strain expresses normal ATase, because the normal glnE gene is dominant in this state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Then, in order to leave only the deletion type glnE gene on the chromosomal DNA, one copy of the glnE gene is eliminated together with the vector segment (including the temperature sensitive replication origin and the drug resistance marker) from the chromosomal DNA by recombination of two of the glnE genes. In this case, the normal glne gene is left on the chromosomal DNA, and the deletion type glnE gene is excised from the chromosomal DNA, or to the contrary, the deletion type glnE gene is left on the chromosomal DNA, and the normal glnE gene is excised from the chromosome DNA. In the both cases, the excised DNA may be retained in the cell as a plasmid when the cell is cultured at a temperature at which the temperature sensitive replication origin can function. Subsequently, if the cell is cultured at a temperature at which the temperature sensitive replication origin cannot function, the glnE gene on the plasmid is eliminated together with the plasmid from the cell. Then, a strain in which glnE gene is disrupted can be obtained by selecting a strain in which the deletion type glnE gene is left on the chromosome using PCR, Southern hybridization or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Further, the inactivation of GS by the adenylylation can also be canceled by reducing the intracellular activity of PII protein. It is known that the PII protein is also involved in the adenylylation of GS by ATase. The PII protein is a signal transfer protein for controlling the GS activity, and it is known to be uridylylated by uridylyl transferase (UTase). The uridylylated PII protein promotes deadenylylation of GS by ATase, and the deuridylylated PII protein promotes the adenylylation of GS by ATase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> It is reported that GS is highly adenylylated in a UTase deficient strain (<highlight><italic>J. Bacteriology, </italic></highlight>569-577, (134) 1978). This phenotype of excessive adenylylation is suppressed by mutation of the PII protein (<highlight><italic>J. Bacteriology, </italic></highlight>816-822, (164) 1985). That is, the inactivation of GS by the adenylylation can also be defected by reduction of PII protein activity. The reduction of PII protein activity means reduction of the function for promoting the adenylylation by ATase. The glnB gene coding for the PII protein of coryneform bacteria has been already isolated, and it is suggested that the suppression of GS by the adenylylation of GS is defected by deletion of the gene (<highlight><italic>FEMS Microbiology Letters, </italic></highlight>303-310, (173) 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> To reduce the PII protein activity of coryneform bacteria, there can be used, for example, a method of treating the coryneform bacteria by ultraviolet irradiation or with a mutagenizing agent used for usual mutagenesis treatment such as N-methyl-N&prime;-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) or a nitrous acid and selecting a mutant strain in which the activity of PII protein is reduced. Coryneform bacteria having reduced PII protein activity can also be obtained by gene disruption, besides the mutagenesis treatment. That is, a coryneform bacterium can be transformed with DNA containing a glnB gene modified with deletion of partial sequence of the gene coding for PII protein so as not to produce PII protein functioning normally (deletion type glnB gene), so that recombination between the deletion type glnB gene and the glnB gene on the chromosome should occur to disrupt the glnB gene on the chromosome. Such gene destruction by utilizing homologous recombination has already been established, and there are methods utilizing a linear DNA, a plasmid that contains a temperature sensitive replication origin and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A glnB gene on host chromosome can be replaced with the deletion type glnB gene, for example, as follows. That is, a recombinant DNA is prepared by inserting a temperature sensitive replication origin, a mutant glnB gene and a marker gene for resistance to a drug such as chloramphenicol, and a coryneform bacterium is transformed with the recombinant DNA. Further, the resultant transformant strain is cultured at a temperature at which the temperature sensitive replication origin does not function, and then the transformant strain can be cultured in a medium containing the drug to obtain a transformant strain in which the recombinant DNA is incorporated into the chromosomal DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In such a strain in which recombinant DNA is incorporated into chromosomal DNA as described above, the mutant glnB gene is recombined with the glnB gene originally present on the chromosome, and the two fusion genes of the chromosomal glnB gene and the deletion type glnB gene are inserted into the chromosome so that the other portions of the recombinant DNA (vector segment, temperature sensitive replication origin and drug resistance marker) should be present between the two fusion genes. Therefore, the transformant expresses normal PII protein, because the normal glnB gene is dominant in this state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Then, in order to leave only the deletion type glnB gene on the chromosomal DNA, one copy of the glnB gene is eliminated together with the vector segment (including the temperature sensitive replication origin and the drug resistance marker) from the chromosomal DNA by recombination of two of the glnB genes. In this case, the normal glnB gene is left on the chromosomal DNA, and the deletion type glnB gene is excised from the chromosomal DNA, or to the contrary, the deletion type glnB gene is left on the chromosomal DNA, and the normal glnB gene is excised from the chromosome DNA. In the both cases, the excised DNA may be stably retained in the cell as a plasmid when the cell is cultured at a temperature at which the temperature sensitive replication origin can function. Subsequently, if the cell is cultured at a temperature at which the temperature sensitive replication origin does not function, the glnB gene on the plasmid is eliminated together with the plasmid from the cell. Then, a strain in which glnB gene is disrupted can be obtained by selecting a strain in which the deletion type glnB gene is left on the chromosome using PCR, Southern hybridization or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Elimination of the adenylylation of GS can also be attained by a combination of two or three items of such mutation of GS that should eliminate the aforementioned adenylylation, reduction of the ATase activity and reduction of the PII protein activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Although enhancement of the GS activity can also be realized by elimination of the adenylylation of GS by ATase, it may also be attained by a combination of it with the aforementioned means for increasing copy number of the GS gene or means for modifying an expression control sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In order to efficiently produce L-glutamine by using the coryneform bacterium of the present invention, it is preferable to use a strain that has enhanced glutamate dehydrogenase (henceforth also referred to as &ldquo;GDH&rdquo;) activity concurrently with the enhanced GS activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;modified so that intracellular GDH activity should be enhanced&rdquo; means that the GDH activity per cell has become higher than that of a non-modified strain, for example, a wild-type coryneform bacterium. For example, there can be mentioned a case where number of GDH molecules per cell increases, a case where GDH specific activity per GDH molecule increases and so forth. Further, as a wild-type coryneform bacterium that serves as an object for comparison, for example, the <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>ATCC 14067 can be mentioned. As a result of enhancement of intracellular GDH activity, there are obtained an effect that culture time of a coryneform bacterium having L-glutamine producing ability is shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Enhancement of the GDH activity in a coryneform bacterium cell can be attained by enhancement of expression of a gene coding for GDH. Enhancement of the expression amount of the gene can be attained by increasing copy number of the gene coding for GDH. For example, a recombinant DNA can be prepared by ligating a gene fragment coding for GDH with a vector functioning in the bacterium, preferably a multi-copy type vector, and introduced into a host having L-glutamine producing ability to transform it. Alternatively, the aforementioned recombinant DNA can be introduced into a wild-type coryneform bacterium to obtain a transformant strain, and then the obtained transformant strain can be imparted with L-glutamine producing ability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> As the gene coding for GDH, any of genes derived from coryneform bacteria and genes derived from other organisms such as bacteria belonging to the genus Escherichia can be used. Among these, genes derived from coryneform bacteria are preferred in view of ease of expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Nucleotide sequence of a gene coding for GDH (gdh gene) of coryneform bacteria has already been elucidated (<highlight><italic>Molecular Microbiology, </italic></highlight>6 (3), 317-326 (1992)). Therefore, a GDH gene can be obtained by PCR utilizing primers prepared based on the nucleotide sequence, for example, the primers mentioned in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 12 and 13, and chromosomal DNA of coryneform bacterium as a template. Genes coding for GDH of microorganisms other than coryneform bacteria can also be obtained in a similar manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The gdh gene can be introduced into coryneform bacteria in a manner similar to that used for the aforementioned GS gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In the coryneform bacterium of the present invention, activities of enzymes other than GS and GDH catalyzing reactions of the L-glutamine biosynthesis may be enhanced. Examples of the enzymes catalyzing reactions of the L-glutamine biosynthesis include isocitrate dehydrogenase, aconitate hydratase, citrate synthase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Further, activities of enzymes that catalyze reactions branching off from the L-glutamine biosynthesis pathway and producing compounds other than L-glutamine may be reduced or eliminated. Examples of the enzymes catalyzing such reactions include isocitrate lyase, &agr;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, glutamate synthase and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> (2) Production of L-glutamine using microorganism of the present invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> By culturing a coryneform bacterium obtained as described above in a medium to produce and accumulate L-glutamine in the medium and correcting the L-glutamine from the medium, L-glutamine can be efficiently produced and the by-production of L-glutamic acid can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In order to produce L-glutamine by using the coryneform bacterium of the present invention, culture can be performed in a conventional manner using a usual medium containing a carbon source, nitrogen source and mineral salts as well as organic trace nutrients such as amino acids and vitamins, as required. Either a synthetic medium or a natural medium may be used. Any kinds of carbon source and nitrogen source may be used so long as they can be utilized by a strain to be cultured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As the carbon source, there are used sugars such as glucose, glycerol, fructose, sucrose, maltose, mannose, galactose, starch hydrolysate and molasses, and organic acids such as acetic acid and citric acid, and alcohols such as ethanol can also be used each alone or in a combination with other carbon sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As the nitrogen source, there are used ammonia, ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate and ammonium acetate, nitrate salts and so forth. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The culture is performed as aeration culture, while the fermentation temperature is controlled to be 20-45&deg; C., and pH to be 5-9. When pH falls during the culture, the medium is neutralized by addition of calcium carbonate or with an alkali such as ammonia gas. A substantial amount of L-glutamine is accumulated in the culture broth after 10 hours to 120 hours of culture in such a manner as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Collection of L-glutamine from the culture broth after the culture may be performed in a conventional manner. For example, after the cells were removed from the culture broth, L-glutamine can be collected by concentrating the broth to crystallize L-glutamine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> (3) DNA coding for protein having glutamine synthetase activity (glnA2 gene) and DNA coding for protein having glutamine synthetase and adenylyl transferase activities (glnE gene) according to the present invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The first DNA of the present invention is a gene coding for GS. The second DNA of the present invention is a gene coding for ATase. These genes can be obtained from a chromosome DNA library of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium lactofermentum </italic></highlight>by hybridization using a partial fragment of a known glnA gene as a probe. The partial fragment of a known glnA gene can be obtained by PCR amplification using chromosome DNA of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium lactofermentum</italic></highlight>, for example, <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium lactofermentum </italic></highlight>ATCC 13869 strain, as a template and the primers shown as SEQ ID NOS: 18 and 19. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Methods of production of genomic DNA library, hybridization, PCR, preparation of plasmid DNA, digestion and ligation of DNA, transformation and so forth for obtaining the DNA of the present invention and enhancement of the GS activity and GDH activity are described in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F. and Maniatis, T., &ldquo;Molecular Cloning&rdquo;, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1.21, 1989. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The nucleotide sequences of the aforementioned primers were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of a glnA gene of <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>(GenBank accession Y13221). By using these primers, a DNA fragment containing a region corresponding to the nucleotide numbers 1921-2282 of the glnA gene (GenBank accession Y13221) can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Examples of nucleotide sequence of DNA fragment containing glnA2 according to the present invention, which is obtained as described above, and amino acid sequence that can be encoded by the sequence are shown as SEQ ID NO: 1. Further, only an amino acid sequence of protein having glutamine synthetase activity, which is encoded by glnA2, is shown in SEQ ID NO: 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Further, in the aforementioned DNA fragment, another ORF was found immediately downstream from ORF of the glnA2 gene. Based on homology comparison with respect to known sequences, that ORF was expected to be a gene (glnE) coding for a protein having glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase activities (ATase). Only the amino acid sequence of the protein having the ATase activity is shown as SEQ ID NO: 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Nucleotide sequences of the DNA fragments containing glnA2 or glnE according to the present invention were clarified by the present invention. Therefore, they can be isolated from chromosomal DNA of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium lactofermentum </italic></highlight>by the PCR method using primers produced based on the nucleotide sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The first DNA of the present invention may be one coding for glutamine synthetase including substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion of one or several amino acids at one or more sites, so long as the glutamine synthetase activity of the encoded protein is not defected. Although the number of &ldquo;several&rdquo; amino acids referred to herein differs depending on position or type of amino acid residues in the three-dimensional structure of the protein, it may be specifically 2 to 90, preferably 2 to 50, more preferably 2 to 20. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The second DNA of the present invention may be one coding for glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase including substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion of one or several amino acids at one or more sites, so long as the glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase activities of the encoded protein are not defected. Although the number of &ldquo;several&rdquo; amino acids referred to herein differs depending on position or type of amino acid residues in the three-dimensional structure of the protein, it may be specifically 2 to 350, preferably 2 to 50, more preferably 2 to 20. Even in a case that the glutamine synthetase and adenylyl transferase activities are impaired, such a DNA fall within the scope of the present invention so long as it causes homologous recombination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> A DNA coding for the substantially same protein as the aforementioned GS or ATase can be obtained by, for example, modifying the nucleotide sequence of glnA2 or glnE by means of the site-directed mutagenesis method so that one or more amino acid residues at a specified site should involve substitution, deletion, insertion, addition or inversion. A DNA modified as described above may also be obtained by a conventionally known mutagenesis treatment. The mutagenesis treatment includes a method of treating a DNA before the mutagenesis treatment in vitro with hydroxylamine or the like, and a method for treating a microorganism such as an genus Escherichia harboring a DNA before the mutagenesis treatment by ultraviolet irradiation or with a mutagenizing agent used for a usual mutagenesis treatment such as N-methyl-N&prime;-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) and nitrous acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> A DNA coding for substantially the same protein as glutamine synthetase or glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase can be obtained by expressing a DNA having such a mutation as described above in an appropriate cell, and investigating activity of an expressed product. A DNA coding for substantially the same protein as GS or ATase can also be obtained by isolating a DNA that is hybridizable with a probe having a nucleotide sequence comprising, for example, the nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotide numbers of 659 to 1996 or 2066 to 5200 of the nucleotide sequence shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NO: 1, under the stringent conditions, and codes for a protein having the glutamine synthetase or a protein having the glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase activity, from DNA coding for glutamine synthetase or glutamine synthetase and adenylyl transferase having a mutation or from a cell harboring it. The &ldquo;stringent conditions&rdquo; referred to herein is a condition under which so-called specific hybrid is formed, and non-specific hybrid is not formed. It is difficult to clearly express this condition by using any numerical value. However, for example, the stringent conditions are exemplified by a condition under which DNAs having high homology, for example, DNAs having homology of not less than 50% are hybridized with each other, but DNAs having homology lower than the above are not hybridized with each other. Alternatively, the stringent conditions are exemplified by a condition under which DNAs are hybridized with each other at a salt concentration corresponding to an ordinary condition of washing in Southern hybridization, i.e., 1&times;SSC, 0.1% SDS, preferably 0.1&times;SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 60&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> As a probe, a partial sequence of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 can also be used. Such a probe may be prepared by PCR using oligonucleotides produced based on the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 as primers, and a DNA fragment containing the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 as a template. When a DNA fragment in a length of about 300 bp is used as the probe, the conditions of washing for the hybridization consist of, for example, 50&deg; C., 2&times;SSC and 0.1% SDS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Genes that are hybridizable under such conditions as described above includes those having a stop codon in the genes, and those having no activity due to mutation of active center. However, such mutation can be easily removed by ligating each gene with a commercially available activity expression vector, and measuring the glutamine synthetase or glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase activities. The glutamine synthetase activity can be measured by, for example, the method described in <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology</italic></highlight>, Vol. XVIIA, 910-915, ACADEMIC PRESS (1970), and the glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase activities can be measured by, for example, the method described in <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology</italic></highlight>, Vol. XVIIA, 922-923, ACADEMIC PRESS (1970). Even a DNA coding for glutamine synthetase adenylyl transferase of which activities are reduced or deleted can also be used in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Specific examples of the DNA coding for a protein substantially the same as GS include DNA coding for a protein that has homology of preferably 80% or more, more preferably 85% or more, still more preferably 90% or more, with respect to the amino acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO: 2 and has GS activity. Specific examples of the DNA coding for a protein substantially the same as ATase include DNA coding for a protein that has homology of preferably 65% or more, more preferably 80% or more, still more preferably 90% or more, with respect to the amino acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO: 3 and has ATase activity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> (1) Cloning of glnA gene of coryneform bacterium </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The glnA sequence of <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>had been already clarified (<highlight><italic>FEMS Microbiology Letters, </italic></highlight>81-88, (154) 1997). Based on the reported nucleotide sequence, the primers shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 4 and 5 were synthesized, and a glnA fragment was amplified by the PCR method using chromosome DNA of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>ATCC 14067 strain as a template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The chromosomal DNA of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>ATCC 14067 strain was prepared by using Bacterial Genome DNA Purification Kit (Advanced Genetic Technologies Corp.). PCR was performed for 30 cycles each consisting of reactions at 94&deg; C. for 30 seconds for denaturation, at 55&deg; C. for 15 seconds for annealing and 72&deg; C. for 2 minutes for extension by using Pyrobest DNA Polymerase (Takara Shuzo). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The produced PCR product was purified in a conventional manner, digested with a restriction enzyme SalI, ligated with pMW219 (Nippon Gene) digested with SalI by using a ligation kit (Takara Shuzo), and used to transform competent cells of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>JM109 (Takara Shuzo). The cells were plated on L medium containing 10 &mgr;g/ml of IPTG, 40 &mgr;g/ml of X-Gal and 25 &mgr;g/ml of kanamycin and cultured overnight. Then, the appeared white colonies were picked up and separated into single colonies to obtain transformants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Plasmids are prepared from the transformants by the alkali method, and a plasmid in which the glnA gene was inserted into the vector was designated as pMW219GS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> (2) Construction of plasmid having glnA and replication origin of coryneform bacteria </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Further, in order to construct a plasmid having the glnA gene and a replication origin of coryneform bacteria, the plasmid pHK4 (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 5-7491) containing replication origin of the plasmid pHM1519 (<highlight><italic>Agric. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>48, 2901-2903 (1984)) that had been already obtained and was autonomously replicable in coryneform bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and KpnI to obtain a gene fragment containing the replication origin. The obtained fragment was blunt-ended by using DNA Blunt-ending Kit (Takara Shuzo) and inserted into the KpnI site of pMW219GS using a KpnI linker (Takara Shuzo). This plasmid was designated as pGS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> (3) Introduction of pGS into coryneform bacterium and evaluation of culture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> An L-glutamine producing bacterium, <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>AJ12418 (FERM BP-2205: refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2-186994), was transformed with the plasmid pGS by the electric pulse method (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2-207791) to obtain a transformant. By using the obtained transformant AJ12418/pGS, culture for L-glutamine production was performed as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Cells of AJ12418/pGS strain obtained by culture on a CM2B plate medium containing 25 &mgr;g/ml of kanamycin were inoculated into a medium containing 100 g of glucose, 60 g of (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 2.5 g of KH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 0.4 g of MgSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, 0.01 g of FeSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, 350 &mgr;g of VB<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-HCl, 4 &mgr;g of biotin, 200 mg of soybean hydrolysates and 50 g of CaCO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in 1 L of pure water (adjusted to pH 6.8 with NaOH) and cultured at 31.5&deg; C. with shaking until the sugar in the medium was consumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> After the completion of the culture, the amount of accumulated L-glutamine in the culture broth was analyzed by liquid chromatography for appropriately diluted culture broth. CAPCELL PAK C18 (Shiseido) was used as a column, and the sample was eluted with an eluent containing 0.095% phosphoric acid, 3.3 mM heptanesulfonic acid and 5% acetonitrile in 1 L of distilled water. The accumulated L-glutamine amount was analyzed based on variation of absorbance at 210 nm. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the pGS-introduced strain, accumulation of L-glutamine (L-Gln) was markedly improved, and by-production of L-glutamic acid (L-Glu) was considerably suppressed. From these results, it was demonstrated that enhancement of GS was effective for improvement of yield in the production of L-glutamine. The data for the enzymatic activity of GS are shown in Table 2 of Example 2. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Evaluation of GS Adenylylation Site-Modified Strain </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> (1) Construction of adenylylation site-modified plasmid </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The adenylylation site of glnA gene product of coryneform bacteria had been already clarified (<highlight><italic>FEMS Microbiology Letters, </italic></highlight>303-310, (173) 1999). Therefore, an adenylylation site-modified strain was obtained by replacing the glnA gene on the chromosome with a glnA gene of which adenylylation site was modified. Specific procedures will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> First, PCR was performed by using chromosome DNA of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>ATCC 14067 strain as a template and the synthetic DNAs shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 6 and 7 as primers to obtain an amplification product for the N-terminus side of the glnA gene. Separately, in order to obtain an amplification product for the C-terminus side of the glnA gene, PCR was performed by using chromosome DNA of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>ATCC 14067 strain as a template and the synthetic DNAs shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 8 and 9 as primers. Since mismatches were introduced into the sequences shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 7 and 8, a mutation was introduced into the terminal portion of each of the amplification products. Then, in order to obtain a glnA gene fragment introduced with a mutation, PCR was performed by using the aforementioned gene products for N- and C-terminus sides of glnA mixed in equimolar amounts as a template and the synthetic DNAs shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 10 and 11 as primers to obtain a glnA gene amplification product introduced with a mutation at the adenylylation site. The produced PCR product was purified in a conventional manner, digested with HincII and inserted into the HincII site of pHSG299 (Takara Shuzo). This plasmid was designated as pGSA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> (2) Construction of adenylylation site-modified strain and evaluation of culture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Since the above pGSA does not contain a region that enables its autonomous replication within cells of coryneform bacteria, when a coryneform bacterium is transformed with this plasmid, a strain in which the plasmid is incorporated into chromosome by homologous recombination is obtained as a transformant although it occurs at an extremely low frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The L-glutamine producing bacterium, <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>AJ12418, was transformed with the plasmid pGSA at a high concentration by the electric pulse method (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2-207791), and transformants were obtained by using kanamycin resistance as a marker. Then, these transformants were subcultured and strains that became kanamycin sensitive were obtained. Further, the sequences of glnA gene of the kanamycin sensitive strains were determined, and a strain in which the adenylylation site in the sequence was replaced with that region of glnA derived from pGSA was designated as QA-1. Culture for L-glutamine production was performed in the same manner as described in Example 1, (3) using AJ12418, AJ12418/pGS and QA-1 strains. The results are shown in Table 2.

For the measurement of blank, the aforementioned reaction solution not containing MSG was used. The crude enzyme solution was prepared by separating cells from the aforementioned culture broth by centrifugation, washing the cells with 100 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), sonicating the cells and removing undisrupted cells and unsoluble protein by centrifugation. Protein concentration of the crude enzyme solution was quantified with Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) by using bovine serum albumin as a standard sample. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Then, a replication origin derived from the plasmid pHM1519 (<highlight><italic>Agric. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>48, 2901-2903 (1984)) that could autonomously replicate in coryneform bacteria was introduced into the SalI site of pHSG399GDH. Specifically, the aforementioned pHK4 was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and KpnI to obtain a gene fragment containing the replication origin, and the obtained fragment was blunt-ended and inserted into the SalI site of pHSG399GDH by using an SalI linker (Takara Shuzo). This plasmid was designated as pGDH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The L-glutamine producing bacterium, <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>AJ12418 strain, was transformed with pGDH to obtain a transformant. Culture for L-glutamine production was performed by the method described in Example 1 using the obtained transformant AJ12418/pGDH. The results are shown in Table 3. In the GDH-enhanced strain, yield of L-glutamine decreased and by-production of L-glutamic acid increased, but culture time was considerably shortened.

<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Chromosomal DNA of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>ATCC 14067 strain was extracted, and PCR was performed by using the chromosomal DNA as a template and the synthetic DNAs shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 14 and 15 as primers. The obtained DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes StuI and PvuII and inserted into the SmaI site of pHSG399. This plasmid was digested with a restriction enzyme SacI to obtain a DNA fragment containing the gdh promoter and a partial fragment of the gdh gene, and it was inserted into the SacI site of pKF19k (Takara Shuzo). This plasmid was designated as pKF19GDH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> A mutation was introduced into the promoter region by using Mutan-Super Express Km (Takara Shuzo). LA-PCR was performed by using pkF19GDH as a template, a selection primer attached to Mutan-super Express Km and a 5&prime;-end phosphorylated synthetic DNA shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NO: 16 or 17 as a primer for mutagenesis. The reaction product was purified by ethanol precipitation, and competent cells of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>MV1184 (Takara Shuzo) were transformed with the product to obtain transformants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Plasmids were extracted from the transformants, and sequences of the gdh promoter region were determined. Among these, those having the sequences shown in Table 4 were designated as pKF19GDH1 and pKF19GDH4. It is expected that the GDH activity can be improved by about 3 times by replacing the gdh promoter sequence with that of pKF19GDH1 type, or by about 5 times by replacing the gdh promoter sequence with that of pKF19GDH4 type, compared with gdh having a promoter of a wild-type (refer to International Patent Publication WO00/18935). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> These plasmids were digested with a restriction enzyme SacI to obtain a DNA fragment containing the gdh promoter and a partial fragment of the gdh gene, and it was inserted into the SacI site of pSFKT2 (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2000-262288). These plasmids were designated as pSFKTGDH1 and pSFKTGDH4, respectively. pSFKT2 was a derivative of the plasmid pAM330 derived from the <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium lactofermentum </italic></highlight>ATCC 13869 strain, and it is a plasmid of which autonomous replication in coryneform bacteria has become temperature sensitive.

<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> A mutation was introduced into the gdh promoter sequence on chromosome as follows. First, the QA-1 strain was transformed with the plasmid pSFKTGDH1 or pSFKTGDH4 by the electric pulse method to obtain a transformant, respectively. After the transformation, culture was performed at 25&deg; C. Then, these transformants were cultured at 34&deg; C., and strains showing kanamycin resistance at 34&deg; C. were selected. Since the aforementioned plasmids cannot autonomously replicate at 34&deg; C., only those in which these plasmids were integrated into chromosome by homologous recombination show kanamycin resistance. Further, the strains in which these plasmids were integrated into chromosome were cultured in the absence of kanamycin, and strains that became kanamycin sensitive were selected. Among those, strains in which the same mutation as that of pSFKTGDH1 or pSFKTGDH4 was introduced into the gdh promoter region on the chromosome were designated as QB-1 and QB-4, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> (3) Construction of gdh gene-amplified strain and measurement of GDH activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The L-glutamine producing bacterium, <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>QA-1 strain, was transformed with the plasmid pGDH described in Example 3, (2) to obtain a transformant. Culture for L-glutamine production was performed by the method described in Example 1 using the obtained transformant QA-1/pGDH. The GDH activity was measured by adding a crude enzyme solution to a solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Cl, 10 mM &agr;-ketoglutaric acid and 0.25 mM NADPH and measuring change of absorbance at 340 nm referring to <highlight><italic>Mol. Microbiology, </italic></highlight>317-326 (6) 1992. The crude enzyme solution was prepared by separating cells from the aforementioned culture broth by centrifugation, washing the cells with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), sonicating the cells and removing undisrupted cells by centrifugation. Protein concentration of the crude enzyme solution was quantified with Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) by using bovine serum albumin as a standard sample. The results are shown in Table 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> As for yield of L-glutamine, the GDH promoter-modified strains, QB-1 and QB-4, showed high yield. Further, the QA-1/pGDH strain also showed higher yield than that obtained with the AJ12418 strain. The culture time of the QA-1/pGDH strain was the shortest. The by-production of L-glutamic acid was markedly improved in the QB-1 and QB-4 strains. From these results, it was demonstrated that the simultaneous enhancement of GS and GDH was effective for improvement of yield of L-glutamine and shortening of culture time.

<heading lvl="1">Acquisition of Gene Coding for Isozyme of GS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In the paper that reported acquisition of glnA of <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>FEMS Microbiol. Letter, </italic></highlight>154 (1997) 81-88), it is described that a &Dgr;glnA-disrupted strain became to show glutamine auxotrophy and lost the GS activity, and it also reported data showing results of Southern blotting and suggesting existence of an isozyme. Further, &ldquo;Amino Acid Fermentation&rdquo;, Japan Science Societies Publication (Gakkai Shuppan Center), pp.232-235 describes that there are two kinds of GS for <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic></highlight>. Therefore, it was attempted to obtain a gene coding for the second GS isozyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> (1) Preparation of probe </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> A gene coding for an isozyme of GS (glnA2) was obtained by colony hybridization. First, PCR was performed by using the primers shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 18 and 19 and chromosomal DNA of the <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium lactofermentum </italic></highlight>ATCC 13869 strain as a template to obtain a partial fragment of the glnA gene. This DNA fragment was labeled by using DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling &amp; Detection Starter Kit I (Boehringer Mannheim) and used as a probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> (2) Colony hybridization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Chromosomal DNA of the <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium lactofermentum </italic></highlight>ATCC 13869 strain was extracted and partially digested with a restriction enzyme Sau3AI, and the obtained DNA fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of the vector of pHSG299 and used to transform the <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>JM109 strain. The obtained transformant was transferred to Hybond-N&plus; (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), denatured, neutralized and then hybridized with the probe prepared in Example 5, (1) by using DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling &amp; Detection Starter Kit I. At this time, a transformant that hybridized strongly and a transformant that hybridized weakly were recognized. Plasmid DNAs were prepared from these transformants and nucleotide sequences of inserts were determined. As a result, clones containing a gene showing high homology with respect to a known glutamine synthetase of coryneform bacteria could be obtained. The total nucleotide sequence of the insert of the latter was shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NO: 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Open reading frames were deduced, and amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences were shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 2 and 3. Each of these amino acid sequences was compared with known sequences for homology. The used database was Genbank. As a result, it became clear that the amino acid sequences encoded by the both of the open reading frames were novel proteins of coryneform bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The nucleotide sequences and the amino acid sequences were analyzed by using Genetyx-Mac computer program (Software Development, Tokyo). The homology analysis was performed according to the method of Lipman and Pearson (<highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>227, 1435-1441, 1985). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The amino acid sequence shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NO: 2 showed 34.6%, 65.6% and 60% of homology with respect to already reported GS of <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>FEMS Microbiology Letters, </italic></highlight>81-88, (154) 1997), GS of <highlight><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic></highlight>(GenBank accession Z70692) and GS of <highlight><italic>Streptomyces coelicolor </italic></highlight>(GenBank accession AL136500), respectively (Table 6), and it was found to be an isozyme of GS of coryneform bacteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the sequence shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NO: 3 showed 51.9% and 33.4% of homology with respect to the already reported ATase of <highlight><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic></highlight>(GenBank accession Z70692) and ATase of <highlight><italic>Streptomyces coelicolor </italic></highlight>(GenBank accession Y17736), respectively (Table 7), and it was found to be ATase of coryneform bacteria. Therefore, it was found that, in the nucleotide sequence shown as SEQ ID NO: 1, the open reading frame coding for the amino acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO: 2 was glnA2, and the open reading frame coding for the amino acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO: 3 was glnE.

<heading lvl="1">Production of L-glutamine by ATase-Deficient Strain </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Since the gene glnE coding for ATase was elucidated in the aforementioned Example 5, a glnE-deficient strain was constructed from the L-glutamine producing bacterium AJ12418. The specific procedure will be shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> First, PCR was performed by using chromosome DNA of <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>ATCC 14067 strain as a template and the synthetic DNAs of SEQ ID NOS: 23 and 24 as primers to obtain a partial fragment of glnE gene. The produced PCR product was purified in a conventional manner, then blunt-ended and inserted into the HincII site of pHSG299 (Takara Shuzo). This plasmid was designated as pGLNE. Then, in order to delete a partial region of the glnE gene in this plasmid, pGLNE was digested with HincII and self-ligated, and the obtained plasmid was designated as p&Dgr;GLNE. This plasmid contained the 2341st to 4650th nucleotides of the nucleotide sequence shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NO: 1, but it had deletion of about 300 bp from the 3343rd HincII recognition site to the 3659th HincII recognition site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Since the above p&Dgr;GLNE does not contain a region that enables its autonomous replication within cells of coryneform bacteria, when a coryneform bacterium is transformed with this plasmid, a strain in which the plasmid is integrated into chromosome by homologous recombination may be produced as a transformant although it occurs at an extremely low frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The L-glutamine producing bacterium, <highlight><italic>Brevibacterium flavum </italic></highlight>AJ12418, was transformed with the plasmid p&Dgr;GLNE at a high concentration by the electric pulse method, and transformants were obtained by using kanamycin resistance as a marker. Then, these transformants were subcultured to obtain strains that became kanamycin sensitive. Further, chromosomal DNAs of the obtained kanamycin sensitive strains were extracted, and PCR was performed by using each chromosomal DNA as a template and the synthetic DNAs shown in Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOS: 23 and 24 as primers to obtain partial fragments of the glnE gene. A strain of which PCR product did not provide about 300 bp fragment when it was digested with HincII was determined as a glnE-disrupted strain. This strain was designated as QA-T. Culture for L-glutamine production was performed in the same manner as described in Example 1, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> (3) by using AJ12418 and QA-T strains. The results are shown in Table 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The QA-T strain showed improvement of L-glutamine accumulation compared with the AJ12418 strain. The results of measurement of the GS activity of these strains are also shown in Table 8. It was confirmed that the GS activity was improved in the QA-T strain compared with the AJ12418 strain.
