<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. P200136970 filed in Korea on Jun. 27, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for forming a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a method for forming a dual damascene line structure to obtain a fine pattern and to minimize polymer production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A related art method for forming a dual damascene line structure will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to D are cross-sectional views illustrating process steps of a related art method for forming a dual damascene line structure, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</cross-reference> to D are cross-sectional views illustrating another related art method for forming a dual damascene line structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A method for forming a via hole after forming a trench and a method for forming a trench after forming a via hole have been suggested as typical methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the related art method for forming a dual damascene line structure includes forming a trench for forming a lower metallic line within an insulating layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then burying a metallic layer inside the trench to form a lower metallic line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a diffusion barrier layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed on the lower metallic line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then, a low inter-metal dielectric IMD material is deposited on the diffusion barrier layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to form an inter-metal dielectric IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Additionally, after depositing a photoresist on the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having a via hole pattern is formed by exposure and developing processes so that a portion of the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In this case, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed thick enough for forming a deep via hole in a later process. Alternatively, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is formed to have a higher etch selectivity than that of the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as a mask, the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is etched by a plasma dry etching process to form a via hole therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, after removing the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a polymer remaining within the via hole is removed by a cleaning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, after depositing a photoresist on the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is negatively patterned to expose a portion of the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, thereby forming a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a trench pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as a mask, the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is selectively etched to form a trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In this case, a micro-trench shown as portion &lsquo;A&rsquo; is formed inside the trench during the etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Additionally, after depositing a metallic material such as tungsten, which is thick enough to completely bury the via hole and the trench, the metallic material is planarized by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. Thus, an upper surface of the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is exposed, thereby forming a plug (not shown) and an upper metallic line (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The process of the aforementioned related art method for forming a dual damascene line structure is simple and has an advantage of preventing an increase in a dielectric constant of the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through the diffusion barrier layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, the aforementioned method has a disadvantage in that, in order to form a deep via hole, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> should be thick enough or the IMD <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> should have a higher etch selectivity than that of the photoresist pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In addition, removing the polymer that remains within the via hole is difficult, and a micro-trench may be formed in etching the trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, another related art method of forming a dual damascene line structure includes sequentially depositing a diffusion barrier layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a first IMD <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, an etching stop layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a second IMD <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> including a lower metallic line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed within an insulating layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Then, after depositing a photoresist on the second IMD <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having a trench pattern is formed by exposure and development processes, thereby exposing a portion of the second IMD <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as a mask, the second IMD <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is etched by a plasma dry etching process exposing a portion of the etching stop layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so as to form a trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having a trench pattern is removed. A photoresist is once again deposited on the entire surface. The photoresist is then patterned by a negative patterning process to expose a portion of the etching stop layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so as to form a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a via hole pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as a mask, the etching stop layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the first IMD <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the diffusion barrier layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are selectively etched exposing a portion of a lower metallic line so as to form a via hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Then, after depositing a metallic material such as tungsten, which is thick enough to completely bury the via hole and the trench, the metallic material is planarized by a CMP process exposing an upper surface of the second IMD <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to form a plug (not shown) and an upper metallic line (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The related art process of the aforementioned method for forming a dual damascene line structure has an advantage of controlling the depth and profile of etching during the trench etching and the via hole etching processes. However, the aforementioned method has a difficulty in controlling the width of the via hole when forming the photoresist pattern for a via hole etching process and an increase in dielectric constant of the IMD due to the etching stop layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the two related art methods for forming a dual damascene line structure have the following problems. When etching a via hole and a trench, by using a photoresist pattern as a mask, it is difficult to form a fine pattern due to the thickness of the photoresist pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This not only results in a difficulty in accurately controlling the size of the trench or the via hole, but also results in a plurality of polymers produced during the etching process of IMDs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method for forming a dual damascene line structure that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</cross-reference> to I are cross-sectional views illustrating the process steps of a method for forming a dual damascene line structure according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> trench is formed within an insulating layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> by a damascene method. In this embodiment, a metallic material is buried within the trench for forming a lower metallic line to form a lower metallic line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a diffusion barrier layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed on the lower metallic line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and a low IMD material is deposited on the diffusion barrier layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to form an IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> consisting of a first region and a second region including the first region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this case, the first region is where a via hole is formed within the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and the second region is where a trench is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> becomes an insulating layer for the lower metallic line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and an upper metallic line, which will be formed in a later process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In addition, a metallic material, such as Ti, TiN, Ta, TaN, or tungsten (W), is deposited on the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to form a hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is deposited at a minimum thickness enabling the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to be etched with plasma in a later process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, after depositing a photoresist on the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, whereby the photoresist on the first region is removed, is formed by exposure and development processes so that a portion of the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this case, the photoresist is deposited at a minimum thickness enabling the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be etched in a later process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The first photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> formed with a minimum thickness is advantageous not only in forming a fine pattern but also in forming an accurate critical dimension of the pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the photoresist is patterned in a state whereby the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is completely protected by the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> on the lower portion of the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be prevented from being damaged or deformed by a developer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as a mask, the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the first region is selectively removed to form a negative via hole within the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In this case, the aforementioned etching process is carried out in a dry etching method using a plasma with which hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> etching is faster than IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> etching. When one of Ti, TiN, Ta, and TaN is chosen for the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a plasma including an activated gas consisting mainly of Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;BCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is used, and when tungsten (W) is used as the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a plasma including an activated gas consisting mainly of SF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is used, thereby obtaining a desired etch selectivity of the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D, a</cross-reference> metallic material identical to that of the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is used for being additionally deposited on the patterned hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this case, the thickness of the additionally deposited metallic material is identical to that of the original hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Then, a metallic material is deposited on an inner sidewall in the shape of a spacer within the first region of the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>so as to form a curved surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>E, after depositing photoresist on the additionally deposited hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, photoresist on the second region is selectively removed by exposure and development processes, thereby exposing a portion of the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to form a photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>having a negative trench pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this case, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed in a small thickness enabling the additionally deposited hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to be etched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Additionally, photoresist is patterned in a state whereby the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is completely protected by the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, damage or deformation of the inter-metal dielectric <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> caused by a developer can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>F, using the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as a mask, the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the second region is selectively etched. Then, a hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of a double pattern is formed, which consists of a via hole pattern having a curved spacer shaped surface and a trench pattern, which is etched to the same thickness as the additionally deposited hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In this case, the aforementioned etching process is carried out to etch the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>using a plasma with which a hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>etching is faster than an inter-metal dielectric <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> etching. When one of Ti, TiN, Ta, or TaN may be chosen for the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a plasma including an activated gas consisting mainly of Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;BCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is used, and when tungsten (W) is used as the hard mask material layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a plasma including an activated gas consisting mainly of SF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is used in a dry etching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The etching process is carried out until the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is exposed at a bottom surface of the first region of the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Afterwards, the photoresist pattern <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is removed. In this case, the curved inner sidewall surface of the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the first region facilitates the removal of the remaining photoresist pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>G, using the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as a mask, the exposed portion of the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is etched at a fixed thickness to form a via hole pattern within the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In this case, the via hole pattern within the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is formed by an etching process using a plasma having an etch selectivity higher than that of the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The plasma having such etch selectivity is used with a C<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>&plus;C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>(wherein a, b, x, y, and z are integers) based gas combined with another gas such as O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or Ar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A via hole pattern is only formed within an inter-metal dielectric that is not protected by the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>through such plasma etching process. Due to the curved sidewall surface of the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the first region, the via hole pattern formed within the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has a sloped shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>H, using a plasma whereby a hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>etching is faster than an IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> etching, the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of the second region is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, using the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>having only a trench pattern as a mask, the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with a via hole pattern is selectively etched to form a via hole and a trench at the same time, whereby the via hole penetrates the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to reach a lower metallic line <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In this case, using a plasma whereby etching an IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is faster than etching the hard mask <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, the plasma having such etch selectivity is used with C<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>&plus;C<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>(wherein a, b, x, y, and z are integers) based gas combined with another gas such as O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or Ar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The sloped via hole pattern within the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> enables the via hole to form a positive slope which facilitates a later process of filling the via hole with a metallic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, after removing the remaining hard mask material through a plasma etching process, a metallic material thick enough to completely bury the via hole and the trench is deposited and planarized by a CMP process, so that an upper surface of the IMD <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is exposed, thereby forming (not shown) and an upper metallic line (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned method for forming a dual damascene line structure according to the present invention has the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> First, by minimizing the thickness of a photoresist for patterning a hard mask, a fine pattern can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> This facilitates the size control of a via hole or a trench and enables accurate critical dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Then, by using a hard mask with a double pattern consisting of a via hole pattern and a trench pattern at the same time, the process can be simplified. In addition, an etching process of an IMD is carried out in a state with absolutely no photoresist, thereby reducing the amount of metallic polymer produced during the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Finally, by forming the via hole to have a positive slope, the process of filling the via hole with a metallic material is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The foregoing embodiments are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teachings can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
