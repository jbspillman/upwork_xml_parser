<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A bandwidth control circuit and method for track-crossing signals used in an optical storage drive is used to generate a second track-crossing signal according to a first track-crossing signal transmitted from an pick-up device of the optical storage drive. The bandwidth control circuit has a first and a second low pass filters for filtering noise of the first track-crossing signal, and a track-crossing velocity calculation device for calculating a frequency of the second track-crossing signal. When the frequency of the second track-crossing signal is higher than a predetermined value, the first low pass filter is used to filter the noise of the first track-crossing signal. Otherwise, the second low pass filter is used to filter the noise of the first track-crossing signal. The method dynamically switches the low pass filters according to the frequencies of the track-crossing signals. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a bandwidth control circuit for track-crossing signals used in an optical storage drive, and more particularly, to a bandwidth control circuit having a track-crossing velocity calculation device for dynamically selecting a filter device. The bandwidth control circuit of the present invention can be used to select the filter devices with different bandwidths corresponding to each of the track-crossing signals with different velocities (frequencies). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In modern society, there has been a spread in the use of optical storage medium, such as compact discs, for recording a huge amount of high-density digital information. The optical storage media have advantages of lightweight, small size, and large capacity for data storage. Meanwhile, a reproducing apparatus, referred to as an optical storage drive, is indispensable for reading out the information stored on the optical storage medium. In order to allow the optical storage drive to read high-density data rapidly, it is necessary to precisely read the recorded information on the optical storage medium. Therefore, developing a precise control system for the optical storage drive with a high access speed has become an important topic of the information industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Typically, the optical storage medium can be divided along a radial direction into a plurality of tracks on which data is stored. When the optical storage drive reads data stored in the tracks on the optical storage medium, a pickup device of the optical storage drive is moved along the radial direction of the optical storage carrier back and forth. Meanwhile, if data to be read is stored in a position that locates at a finite number of tracks apart from the current position of the pickup device, the pickup device has to perform a long and then short distance track-crossing processes so as to reach the target track. In the long distance track-crossing process, a track-crossing velocity (or a track-crossing frequency) of the pink-up device is accelerated from a lower velocity (or a lower frequency) to a higher velocity (or a higher frequency). Then, when approaching the target track, the pick-up device is decelerated by a brake mechanism so that the pick-up device can be positioned in a vicinity of the target track. Thereafter, the pick-up device is moved precisely to the target track of the optical storage medium during the short distance track-crossing process so as to read data in the target track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the optical storage drive reads data in the optical storage medium, a chipset in the optical storage drive receives a track-crossing signal, which is generally a radio frequency (RF) signal transmitted from the pick-up device of the optical storage drive. After the track-crossing signal is held at peak, the track-crossing signal is filtered by a low pass filter which has a specific bandwidth so as to filter out high-frequency noise that has a great influence on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the track-crossing signal. When the bandwidth of the low pass filter is too wide, the high-frequency noise cannot be filtered out and the SNR of the track-crossing signal is thus reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Generally, the prior chipset manufacturer sets the bandwidth of the above-mentioned low pass filter around 200 KHz. The low pass filter with such bandwidth can thus merely deal with the track-crossing signal at 200 KHz, i.e., the condition of crossing 200,000 tracks of the optical storage medium within one second. However, for a high-speed optical storage drive, the speed of the long distance track-crossing process is much faster, and the frequency of the corresponding track-crossing signal is thus higher. Consequently, the higher frequency of the track-crossing signal is filtered out inappropriately due to the narrow bandwidth of the low pass filter. This situation is more serious if the number of tracks on the optical storage medium is increased. For example, the number of tracks on a digital versatile disc (DVD) is twice as many as the number of tracks on a compact disc (CD). Additionally, since the bandwidth of the prior low pass filter is too narrow, the prior low pass filter can only deal with the track-crossing signals that have low frequencies. Under this condition, for achieving the purpose of reading data accurately, the chipset manufacturer usually utilizes an optical grating to calculate the track-crossing velocity so as to meet the requirements of the long distance track-crossing process. However, the installation of the optical grating further increases the cost of the optical storage drive. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore a primary objective of the claimed invention to provide a bandwidth control circuit and method for track-crossing signals used in an optical storage drive to solve the above-mentioned problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the claimed invention, a bandwidth control circuit for track-crossing signals used in an optical storage drive is used for generating a second track-crossing signal according to a first track-crossing signal transmitted from an pick-up device of the optical storage drive. The bandwidth control circuit comprises an input end for receiving the first track-crossing signal, an output end for outputting the second track-crossing signal, a filter device electrically connected to the input end and the output end for filtering noise of the first track-crossing signal so as to generate the second track-crossing signal, a track-crossing velocity calculation device electrically connected to the output end for calculating a frequency of the second track-crossing signal and then generating a calculation result, and a filter selection device electrically connected to the track-crossing velocity calculation device for controlling the filter device according to the calculation result. The filtering device further comprises at least a first low pass filter and a second low pass filter, and each of the low pass filters has different bandwidths. When the frequency of the second track-crossing signal calculated by the track-crossing velocity calculation device is higher than a predetermined value, the filter selection device controls the filter device to filter the noise of the first track-crossing signal via the first low pass filter. Conversely, when the frequency of the second track-crossing signal calculated by the track-crossing velocity calculation device is lower than the predetermined value, the filter selection device controls the filter device to filter the noise of the first track-crossing signal via the second low pass filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an advantage of the claimed invention that the bandwidth control circuit and method are capable of dynamically switching the low pass filters with different bandwidths according to the different frequencies of the track-crossing signals of the optical storage drive. The bandwidth control circuit and method of the present invention not only can deal with the track-crossing signal with a high speed and a high frequency, but also can maintain the SNR of the track-crossing signal. Consequently, the performance of reading data on the optical storage carrier for the optical storage drive can be substantially improved. </paragraph>

When the distance is longer, the velocity (or the frequency) required by the pick-up device is greater, and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the bandwidth control method of the present invention determines the type of the filter being used in step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, several types of the filters set previously are provided for selection. in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first low pass filter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 100 KHz, the second low pass filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 250 KHz, and the third low pass filter <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 500 KHz are provided.

In the step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, if the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is not higher than the critical frequency of 88 KHz, then the flow goes to the step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the procedure goes to the step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to calculate the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> again. In the step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, if the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is lower than the another critical frequency of 220 KHz, then the flow goes to the step <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to continue using the second low pass filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 250 KHz. Otherwise, the procedure goes to the step <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to calculate the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Finally, when in the step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it is determined the filter being used is the third low pass filter <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 500 KHz, then the procedure goes to the step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to calculate the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. If the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is higher than the critical frequency of 220 KHz, then the flow goes to the step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to continue using the third low pass filter <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 500 KHz. Otherwise, the procedure goes to the step <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. In the step <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, if the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is higher than the critical frequency of 220 KHz, then the flow goes to the step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to continue using the third low pass filter <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 500 KHz. If not, then the flow goes to the step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for using the second low pass filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 250 KHz instead of using the third low pass filter <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. After the steps <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are completed and which of the three low pass filters <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to be used is determined, the procedure of the bandwidth control method ends in the step <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Then, another procedure of the bandwidth control method <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is restarted at the next trigger of the optical storage drive within a predetermined time interval, which is determined by a circuit designer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the bandwidth control method <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the steps <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are used not only to adapt to the variations of the track-crossing velocity, but also to ensure the accuracy of the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Since the track-crossing signals may be affected by glitches or other unexpected noise, the steps <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be performed repeatedly so as to confirm the suitability of the filter. In the actual circuit design, a register may be used to store a value for comparison. When a frequency of a track-crossing signal is higher than a predetermined value, the register automatically adds the value of one to the value. Then, when the value stored in the register is greater than a default value set previously, the frequency of the track-crossing signal can thus be ensured so that the procedure can proceed to the next step. Meanwhile, the value in the register is reset so as to be used in the next trigger of the optical storage drive within a predetermined time interval. Additionally, the method for calculating the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes providing a pulse signal with a predetermined period, then calculating a number of second track-crossing signals <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> within one period of the pulse signal. Incidentally, each of the low pass filters <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> has different bandwidths, and these bandwidths and the critical frequency smaller than the bandwidths of the low pass filters <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, are all determined by a circuit designer for meeting requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram illustrating frequency variations of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> during a long distance track-crossing process. When the pick-up device performs the long distance track-crossing process, the pick-up device is accelerated from a static state to a permitted higher velocity. Then, when approaching the target track, the pick-up device is decelerated by a brake mechanism so that the pick-up device can position in the vicinity of the target track. Thereafter, the pick-up device is moved precisely to the target track of the optical storage medium during a short distance track-crossing process so as to read data in the target track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is gradually increased to a first critical frequency, such as 88 KHz in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the filter selection device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> controls the filter device <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to use the second low pass filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and when the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is lower than the first critical frequency, the filter selection device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> controls the filter device <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to continue using the first low pass filter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Then, when the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is increased to a second critical frequency, such as 220 KHz in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the filter selection device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> controls the filter device <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to use the third low pass filter <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> with the bandwidth of 500 KHz. Likewise, when the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is lower than the second critical frequency, the filter selection device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> controls the filter device <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to continue using the first low pass filter <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> or the second low pass filter <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. After the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> exceeds the second critical frequency, a restriction is imposed on the track-crossing velocity so that the track-crossing velocity has an upper limit of a default value which equals to the bandwidth of the third low pass filter <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the filter device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> continues using the third low pass filter <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is maintained for a period until the number of tracks apart from the target track is below a predetermined value. When approaching the target track, the pick-up device is decelerated and the filter is switched according to the range of the frequency of the second track-crossing signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the same manner as the above-mentioned acceleration procedure. According to the procedures described previously, the optical storage drive of the present invention can thus achieve the purpose of dynamically switching the filters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the prior art, the bandwidth control circuit and method according to the present invention is capable of dynamically switching filters with different bandwidths according to a calculated frequency of a track-crossing signal. According to the present invention, the optical storage drive can not only deal with a track-crossing signal with a high frequency, but also can prevent the alteration of a signal to noise ratio. Furthermore, the optical storage drive of the present invention does not require gratings to compensate a high speed of a long distance track-crossing process, and the cost of the optical storage drive can thus be substantially reduced. Consequently, the optical storage drive with the bandwidth control circuit of the present invention can have high-speed performance through the switching of filters, and eliminates the potential problem for mechanical breakdowns of the gratings. Incidentally, the present invention is especially suitable for use in the mass production of application specific integrated circuits (ASIC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention. Accordingly, the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims. </paragraph>
