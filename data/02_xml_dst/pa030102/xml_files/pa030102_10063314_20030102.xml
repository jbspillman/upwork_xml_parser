<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an articulated hauler or truck, such as a dumper. The truck includes a vehicle part having a drive engine and a load-bearing vehicle part. The vehicle parts are interconnected in an articulated manner about a vertical pin. The load-bearing vehicle part is provided with at least one wheel axle driven by the drive engine via a mechanical transmission and arranged at a distance from the vertical pin. The vehicle part with the drive engine is provided with at least one wheel axle driven by the drive engine and arranged at a considerably shorter distance from the vertical pin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is previously known to provide an articulated truck such as a dumper with all-wheel drive in order to obtain good passability when driving on soft and/or slippery surfaces. To accomplish this, the drive line of the truck includes a front wheel axle arranged in a front vehicle part with a differential that, via a propeller shaft, is driven, via a distribution gearbox, by a gearbox arranged in the drive engine of the truck. The distribution gearbox also transmits the torque of the drive engine to a rear wheel axle differential arranged in a rear vehicle part via a second propeller shaft. In the event that the truck is provided with a second rear wheel axle, the torque of the drive engine is transmitted between the first rear wheel axle and the differential of the second rear wheel axle via a further propeller shaft arranged between the wheel axles. The differentials make it possible for the wheels on one and the same axle to cover distances of different length that may occur, such as when cornering and negotiating obstacles. As long as the wheels have a good grip, this works well. However, if the grip of one of the wheels on a wheel axle worsens, the wheel starts to slip, and the power of the drive engine is consequently led out to the slipping wheel. Accordingly, the grip of the slipping wheel decides the combined driving power of the two wheels. Against this background, a differential lock is usually arranged so as to lock the differential, making the wheels rotate at the same speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As known in the art, a longitudinal differential is also arranged between the front wheel axle of the front vehicle part and the rear wheel axle of the rear vehicle part in a manner corresponding to the differentials described above. This is done in order to make it possible for the wheels on the front and rear wheel axles to cover distances of different length, for example, when cornering or negotiating obstacles. As long as all wheels have a good grip, this works well. However, if the grip of the wheels on one wheel axle becomes worse (usually the front wheel axle in the case of a loaded vehicle), the wheels start to slip, and the power of the drive engine is then led out to the slipping wheel(s). The longitudinal differential is therefore also provided with a differential lock arranged so as to lock the differential, causing all the wheels to rotate at the same speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned differential locks are operated by the driver of the truck, who is therefore responsible for both engaging and disengaging the locks. As trucks of the above-mentioned type are often used on sites with very varied surfaces, for example, alternately mud and asphalt, frequent engagement and disengagement of the differential locks is required in order to avoid increased wear/stress on the transmission of the truck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A particularly marked problem occurs in articulated trucks such as a dumper having a front vehicle part pivotally connected about a vertical pin to a rear vehicle part, where the rear vehicle part has a wheel axle arranged at a distance from the vertical pin, and the front vehicle part has a front wheel axle arranged at a considerably shorter distance from the vertical pin. During cornering, the wheels on the wheel axles run on considerably different turning radii. If the truck is driven through a curve with the longitudinal differential lock engaged, particularly when loaded and/or on a surface with good grip, the transmission is subjected to great restrained torques due the wheels on the front wheel axle trying to rotate at a higher speed than the wheels on the rear wheel axle. In addition to the stresses on the transmission, this also results in increased tire wear and an impaired driving feeling when the truck is under-steered, that is to say, tries to go straight on during cornering. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a solution to the above-mentioned problems by producing an articulated truck in which great restrained torques in the transmission of the truck associated with cornering, are avoided. This is achieved by providing an articulated lorry, such as a dumper, having a vehicle part containing the drive engine and a load-bearing vehicle part. The vehicle parts are pivotably interconnected about a vertical pin. The load-bearing vehicle part is provided with at least one first wheel axle driven by the drive engine via a mechanical transmission, with the axle being arranged at a distance from the vertical pin. The vehicle part bearing the drive engine is provided with at least one second wheel axle driven by the drive engine. This second wheel axle is arranged at a considerably shorter distance from the vertical pin than the first wheel axle. The second wheel axle is also driven via a hydrostatic transmission. As the first wheel axle on the load-bearing vehicle part is driven by the drive engine via a mechanical transmission, the driving torque of the drive engine is transmitted to those wheels which, when the vehicle is loaded, can be expected to have the best grip. At the same time, part of the driving torque of the drive engine can be transmitted to the second wheel axle, even during cornering, without great restrained torques arising. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the hydrostatic transmission comprises a hydraulic pump driven by the drive engine and coupled to a hydraulic motor. The hydraulic motor is arranged for driving the second wheel axle, and is arranged at the differential of the second wheel axle. By arranging the hydraulic motor at the differential of the wheel axle, only one hydraulic motor is required for driving both wheels of the wheel axle, contributing to both weight-saving and simplified installation as relatively little space is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the hydraulic pump is coupled to other hydraulic components arranged on the truck. This results in both weight-saving and simplified installation by virtue of the fact that fewer hydraulic pumps have to be accommodated in the space which is available in connection with the drive engine of the lorry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the hydraulic pump is coupled to tipping cylinders arranged for tipping a container arranged on the load-bearing vehicle part. This enables all of the oil flow delivered by the hydraulic pump to be used for propulsion when the truck is driven. When the truck is stationary, in connection with tipping, all of the oil flow is then available for the tipping cylinders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, a coupling is arranged between the hydraulic motor and the second wheel axle for selective coupling of the hydraulic motor to the second wheel axle. This allows the driving wheels on the hydrostatically driven second wheel axle to be uncoupled, for example, when driving on roads, resulting in reduced transmission losses and, accordingly, reduced fuel consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the coupling is a toothed coupling that is preferably pneumatically operated between a coupled position and an uncoupled position. In this way, a robust coupling is obtained which can be engaged and disengaged during truck trips without being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, a detector is arranged so as to detect a driving situation in which the coupling is adapted so as to uncouple the hydraulic motor from the second wheel axle. By automating the engagement and disengagement of the drive to the second wheel axle based on the current driving situation, unnecessary driving with the drive engaged is avoided, resulting in reduced fuel consumption and reduced wear on the hydrostatic transmission. In this context, the detector is connected to an electronic control unit which engages or disengages the drive on the second wheel axle depending on the detected driving situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the invention involving a driving situation concerning the speed of the tuck, the hydraulic motor is arranged so as to be uncoupled from the second wheel axle when a predetermined speed is exceeded. Another driving situation involves the current gear used in the gearbox of the truck. The above driving situations can be used as indicators that the truck is being driven under conditions wherein the drive of the second wheel axle is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further preferred embodiments and advantages of the invention can be understood by the following description.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a side view of an articulated or articulated frame-steered truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, known as a dumper or dump truck, according to the present invention. The truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a front vehicle part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> containing or housing the drive engine, and a rear load-bearing vehicle part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> connected to the front vehicle part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a vertical articulation pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The load-bearing vehicle part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also provided with a tippable container <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which can be raised/tipped by hydraulic cylinders <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The front and rear vehicle parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are also interconnected in an articulated manner about a horizontal pivot pin (not shown) so that the vehicle parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be rotated in relation to one another about a longitudinal axis of the truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To steer the truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when driven, the front vehicle part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pivots about the vertical articulation pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by means of a pair of hydraulic cylinders (not shown), each being arranged on its own side of the articulation pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the driving torque delivered by the drive engine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is transmitted to a first wheel axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> arranged on the load-bearing vehicle part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via a mechanical transmission <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The transmission <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> includes a first propeller shaft <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged between the gearbox <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the differential of the first wheel axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Between the first wheel axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and an additional wheel axle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> arranged on the load-bearing vehicle part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a second propeller shaft <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for transmitting the driving torque delivered by the drive engine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Each wheel axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided with wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The driving torque delivered by the drive engine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is also transmitted to a second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> arranged on the vehicle part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> bearing the drive engine via a hydrostatic transmission <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The hydrostatic transmission <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is arranged on and driven by the drive engine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and is coupled to a hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for driving the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided with wheels <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An important feature of the truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is the distance between the individual wheel axles <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the vertical pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> about which the vehicle parts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> pivot in relation to one another. The first distance, distance Y, between the first wheel axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the vertical pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is considerably greater than the second distance, distance X, between the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and vertical pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The third and greatest distance, distance Y&plus;Z, is the distance to the vertical pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from the additional wheel axle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> arranged on the load-bearing vehicle part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This results in the first wheel axle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having considerably different turning radii in connection with cornering, as will be described below. The ratio X/Y is within the range of about 0.15 to about 0.5, and preferably is about 0.35. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a view from above, partly in cross section, of an articulated truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The vehicle part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> bearing the drive engine is pivoted about the vertical pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> relative to the load-bearing vehicle part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> when cornering. In this context, the wheel axles <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the load-bearing vehicle part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> follow the turning radius R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> while the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> arranged on the vehicle part <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> bearing the drive engine follows the turning radius R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Obviously, since the turning radius R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is greater than the turning radius R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the wheels <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> must, in connection with cornering, cover a greater distance than the wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the wheel axles <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> arranged on the load-bearing vehicle part <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> simplified hydraulic/mechanical/electronic connection diagram for a hydrostatic transmission <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is described below. In this context, the transmission includes an hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with variable displacement, which is driven by the drive engine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and is coupled, via a reverse valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, to a hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with variable displacement. The reverse valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> changes the direction of oil flow through the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, making it possible to drive the truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> both forwards and backwards. After the oil has passed through the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it is led back to a tank <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to which the suction side <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic pump is coupled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided with a lockable differential <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> arranged in association with an angle gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which, via an intermediate transmission <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (for adapting the speed of the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to a lower speed suitable for the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) and a coupling <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, is coupled to the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Since the coupling <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is arranged between the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be uncoupled when it is not required for propulsion of the truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Engagement and disengagement are effected by a pneumatic operating arrangement (not shown), which in turn is controlled by an electronic control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The electronic control unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> controls the coupling <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> based on the driving situation, such as vehicle speed and gear, that is detected by detectors <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, the coupling <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to uncouple the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is driven at speeds in excess of 20 km/h. The second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can also be uncoupled manually by the driver of the vehicle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, such as by reversing a switch <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> arranged in the cab of the vehicle. When the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is uncoupled from the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the truck <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is propelled via only the mechanical transmission <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which is connected to an output shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the drive engine <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Since the reverse valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, intermediate transmission <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, coupling <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, angle gear <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and differential <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are integrated in a drive unit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a very compact and space-saving installation is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the fact that a dividing valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is arranged on the pressure side <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, upstream of the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also provides a source of power for the tipping cylinders <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in connection with tipping of the container <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a toothed coupling that can be arranged between the hydraulic motor <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the differential <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the second wheel axle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Since the coupling <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is a toothed coupling, no torque whatsoever is transmitted during driving when the coupling is in the uncoupled position. The toothed coupling includes an input shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connected to the intermediate transmission <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, with an input drive wheel <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> provided with coupling teeth <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for interacting with corresponding coupling teeth <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> on an output drive wheel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The output drive wheel <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is arranged displaceably along a splined joint <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, arranged on an output shaft <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, by means of the pneumatic operating arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the invention are contemplated. For example, the coupling can be in the form of a plate coupling instead of the toothed coupling described above. Furthermore, other/additional hydraulic components, such as a crane, can be coupled to the hydraulic pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> While there has been disclosed effective and efficient embodiments of the invention using specific terms, it should be well understood that the invention is not limited to such embodiments as there might be changes made in the arrangement, disposition, and form of the parts without departing from the principle of the present invention as comprehended within the scope of the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
