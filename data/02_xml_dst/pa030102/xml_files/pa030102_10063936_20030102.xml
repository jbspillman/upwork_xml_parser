<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present application claims priority to Swedish Patent Application No. 0101891-0 filed May 28, 2001. Said application is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a load carrier foot arrangement, comprising a load carrier foot which supports a load carrier and which is designed to be mounted on an elongated rail profile which is mounted on a vehicle body, preferably the roof thereof. The rail profile has a cross-section exhibiting a cavity and upturned walls enclosing between them a gap which is in communication with the cavity and wherein the walls in one area thereof exhibit a mounting opening in which the load carrier foot is mounted. At least one of the walls exhibits along its length one or more notches and the load carrier foot has a locking device including a locking plate which is located in the cavity when the load carrier foot is mounted on the rail profile. The locking plate is attached by connecting elements to a locking spindle which is rotatably mounted in the load carrier foot and equipped with a first set of eccentric cams to which the connecting elements are attached in such a manner that the locking plate is moved towards and away from the load carrier foot depending on the direction of rotation of the locking spindle. By this action, the locking plate is brought into engagement with the walls of the rail when moved in the locking direction towards the load carrier foot and in this way the load carrier foot is prevented from moving along the rail profile. The locking spindle has a second eccentric area to which a retaining catch is rotatably mounted. The retaining catch, when the locking plate is moved in the direction of the load carrier foot, is inserted into a notch in the rail when the load carrier foot is so positioned on the rail profile that the retaining catch assumes a position on the rail profile which is aligned with a notch. In this way, any movement of the load carrier foot along the rail profile is prevented through the interference of the retaining catch with the edges of the notch in the event that the load carrier foot shifts on the rail profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A load carrier foot arrangement having similar purpose to that described above is disclosed in Swedish Patent Application SE 9901417-7. The drawback of this earlier solution, however, is that it is possible to mount the load carrier foot on the rail profile in the mounting area and, while the foot is still in this area, to turn the locking spindle to the locked position without either the locking plate or the retaining catch coming into engagement with the rail profile. This results in the load carrier foot not being secured to the rail profile, which can have disastrous consequences if the load carrier comes loose from the rail profile while the vehicle on which it is mounted is in motion. A further drawback of this earlier known solution is that it can be difficult to bring the load carrier foot into such a position on the rail profile that the retaining catch coincides with a notch in the rail. This means that exact fitting is required, which can be perceived as bothersome and irritating. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks by means of an arrangement of the type earlier described and characterized in that the retaining catch possesses a stop face and a sensing element. The retaining catch is prestressed by a tensioning means to a position such that the stop face interferes obstructively with the load carrier foot and prevents rotation of the locking spindle in a locking direction when the sensing element is not actuated. The mounting opening is of such a size that the sensing element is not actuated when the load carrier foot is installed in the mounting opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further characterized in that the sensing element, when the load carrier foot is moved along the rail profile away from its original mounting or installation position, it is continuously actuated in opposition to the prestressing force by the rail wall that exhibits the notches to assume a position such that the stop face can move past the load carrier foot, but in which position the stop face interferes obstructively with the top of the rail wall and prevents rotation of the locking spindle in the locking direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention may further be characterized in that the retaining catch exhibits a stop face and a sensing element and that the retaining catch is prestressed by a tensioning means to a position such that the sensing element contacts the rail wall having the notches as the load carrier foot is moved along the rail profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Further, the sensing element is snapped into the notches by the prestressing force as the sensing element moves past such notches thereby providing an indication of those positions of the load carrier foot on the rail in which the retaining catch can be inserted down into the notch.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows part of a vehicle roof <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to which a rail profile <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fixed. A load carrier foot <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is mounted on the rail profile <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a load carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is attached to the load carrier foot <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a vehicle roof, viewed from above, with two rail profiles fixed thereto. It is readily apparent to one skilled in the art that the intention is that each respective rail profile shall have mounted thereon a respective load carrier foot with a load carrier extending between them. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a rail profile <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in cross-section and from which it appears that the profile possesses a cavity <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with upturned walls <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> enclosing between them a gap <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> which is in communication with the cavity <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It is further apparent that the rail profile has a bottom <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and two walls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. It is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> that the rail profile possesses a mounting opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and that there are notches <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> disposed along the wall <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a load carrier foot <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, viewed from the side and mounted on a rail profile <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For the clearer illustration of the invention, the cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and which covers the load carrier foot is omitted and the side of the rail profile <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> facing the observer is shown in cutaway, or as if it is transparent. As it appears from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the load carrier foot <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes a foot element <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprising a base element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a casing element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The base element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and casing element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be united by welding, riveting and other suitable methods recognized by those skilled in the art. Similarly, the attachment of the load carrier <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the casing element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be similarly effected by welding, riveting and other suitable methods likewise familiar to the persons skilled in these arts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The base element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is attached to an anchor portion by means of screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and including a slide shoe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which supports the base element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and slides on the rail bottom <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. A splined locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted in the casing element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by means of bearing seats <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which are fixed in a known manner to the casing element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> possesses an operating element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by which the locking spindle is easily turned. Mounted on the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are eccentric cams <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> whose function will be apparent from the descriptions of FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> found hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A locking member of plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is rotatably connected to the cams <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by means of connecting elements <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, respectively. The locking plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is guided in the rail profile <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the provision of two posts <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, disposed on a sliding shoe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and passing through respective holes in the locking plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A retaining catch or catch means <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is mounted rotatably and eccentrically on the locking spindle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The base element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> possesses a first and a second integrated downturned tab <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively, between which the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is located when the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is inserted down into a notch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and which prevent the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from moving relative to the base element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the lengthwise direction of the rail profile <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</cross-reference> are respective sectional views taken along the line A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> the load carrier foot is placed in the mounting opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the rail profile. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> the load carrier foot has been introduced into the rail profile in a position between the notches <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> the load carrier foot is shown with the retaining catch in engagement with a notch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In these figures, the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is shown as being hexagonal. This shape is chosen to facilitate the non-rotatable mounting of the eccentric cams and the retaining catch on the locking spindle. It will be evident to one skilled in the art that the hexagonal section transitions to a circular section in the area where the locking spindle is journalled to the bearing seats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is carried by the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and is rotatably supported on a bushing <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which is eccentrically and non-rotatably mounted on the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided with a lug <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to which an elastic element, exemplarily in the form of a helical spring <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, is attached at one end thereof. The other end of the helical spring is attached to the casing element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This achieves a counter-clockwise prestressing of the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Also apparent from the figures are the stop face <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, integrated with the retaining catch, and the sensing element, member or means <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Further apparent from the figures are the eccentric cam <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the connecting element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the locking plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. As can be seen, the connecting element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> exhibits a circular bearing surface <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is engaged by, and actuated by, the eccentric cam <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. It will be evident to one skilled in the art that the cam <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the connecting element <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are designed to have a configuration matching the cam <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the connecting element <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Functioning of the invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The load carrier foot <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is mounted on the rail profile <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by inserting the sliding shoe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> into the mounting opening <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The mounting opening is of such a size that the sensing element <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is not actuated and the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is prestressed by the helical spring <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in a counter-clockwise direction to a position wherein the stop face <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is located above an edge region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the base element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as may be appreciated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. If the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is now turned, the stop face <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will strike against the edge region or blocking means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, whereby further turning of the locking spindle is blocked. By this means or arrangement, it is ensured that the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> cannot be brought into locked position while the load carrier foot is in a mounting position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When the load carrier foot is moved along the rail profile, the sensing element <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> actuated by the wall <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the rail and the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be rotated clockwise to the position that is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In this position the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has been rotated to a position wherein the stop face <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> does not strike the edge region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, however, the wall <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the rail will be struck if the locking spindle is turned in the locking direction. In this way, the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is prevented from being turned to its locked position. As the load carrier foot is moved along the rail profile, the sensing element <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, under the force or bias exerted by the helical spring <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, will snap into an encountered notch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. It is further apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> that the sensing element <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is of an extension and shape such that the sensing element is easily moved past a notch in the rail as the load carrier foot is shifted along the rail profile. Exemplarily, and as illustrated, the sensing means <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> has a dome-shaped button portion that advantageously enables this function. It is from this encounter of the sensing element <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> with a notch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that a indication, for example by a minor increase in resistance to travel, is given that the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in a region where it can be pushed down into the sensed notch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> assuming the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>. In this position, the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be turned to its locked position, and in this locked position, the retaining catch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has been pressed down into the encountered notch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the wall <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the rail. At the same time, the retaining catch is enclosed by the tabs <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the base element. In this way, relative movement between the rail profile and the base element is prevented as may be best appreciated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is further apparent from the figures and readily evident to those persons skilled in the art that as the locking spindle <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotated, the eccentrically arranged cams <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will likewise be rotated from the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to the position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. By this action, the connecting elements <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> raise the locking plate <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> into frictional locking engagement with the rail profile, and in this way locking the load carrier foot to the rail profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The invention is of course not limited by the above description but only by the following claims. </paragraph>
