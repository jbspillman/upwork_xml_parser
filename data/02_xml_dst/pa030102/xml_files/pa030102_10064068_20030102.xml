<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for coronary imaging, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for computed tomographic (CT) imaging of specific artery branches with reduced motion artifacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Computed tomographic (CT) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be utilized to visualize coronary arteries, which are very tiny structures. However, visualization of these structures is difficult, because different coronary arteries are subject to different motions throughout a cardiac cycle. For example, the right coronary artery (RCA) remains on a single plane and undergoes large displacements. The left anterior descending (LAD) vessel, on the other hand, lies on a curved surface and its branches follow different motion patterns. Known electrocardiograph (EKG) driven reconstruction methods and apparatus do not take these variations into account, so it has been difficult to achieve optimum visualization of at least some coronary arteries. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and preceded with the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;an&rdquo; should be understood as not excluding plural said elements or steps, unless such exclusion is explicitly recited. Furthermore, references to &ldquo;one embodiment&rdquo; of the present invention are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also as used herein, the phrase &ldquo;reconstructing an image&rdquo; is not intended to exclude embodiments of the present invention in which data representing an image is generated but a viewable image is not. However, many embodiments generate (or are configured to generate) a viewable image. Included among the embodiments generating a viewable image are some that generate a plurality of images, each corresponding to a different z-axis location. Further as used herein, a &ldquo;segment&rdquo; of a coronary artery branch is considered as any portion of the branch that is adequately characterized, for image motion artifact reduction purposes, by a single low motion cardiac phase. Thus, it is not impossible that, in some cases, an entire branch may be considered as constituting a single segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition, as used herein, a &ldquo;given&rdquo; or &ldquo;desired&rdquo; cardiac phase refers to all or part of a contiguous range of phases around a targeted cardiac phase. The range is such that, were a sufficient number and angular range of views within the range available for a specified portion of the heart, that portion would appear sufficiently stationary such that a substantially artifact-free image could be reconstructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a computed tomography (CT) imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown as including a gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> representative of a &ldquo;third generation&rdquo; CT scanner. Gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has at least one x-ray radiation source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that projects a beam of x-ray radiation <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> toward a detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the opposite side of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Radiation beam <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is, for example, a fan beam, a cone beam, or a parallel beam. Detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed by detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that together sense the projected x-rays that pass through an object <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for example a medical patient. Each detector element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> produces an electrical signal that represents the intensity of an impinging x-ray beam and hence the attenuation of the beam as it passes through patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. During a scan to acquire x-ray projection data, gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the components mounted thereon rotate about a center of rotation <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fabricated in a multi-slice configuration. In a multi-slice configuration, detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a plurality of rows of detector elements or cells <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, only one of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. One or more additional rows of detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in such configurations are arranged parallel to the illustrated row, and each row is transverse to the translation direction of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (i.e., the z-axis or patient axis). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Rotation of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the operation of x-ray source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are governed by a control mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of CT system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Control mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes an x-ray controller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that provides power and timing signals to x-ray source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a gantry motor controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that controls the rotational speed and position of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A data acquisition system (DAS) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in control mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> samples analog data from detector elements or cells <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and converts the data to digital signals for subsequent processing. An image reconstructor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> receives sampled and digitized x-ray data from DAS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and performs high speed image reconstruction. The reconstructed image is applied as an input to a computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which stores the image in a mass storage device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> also receives commands and scanning parameters from an operator via console <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that has a keyboard. An associated cathode ray tube display <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> allows the operator to observe the reconstructed image and other data from computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The operator supplied commands and parameters are used by computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to provide control signals and information to DAS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, x-ray controller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and gantry motor controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In addition, computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> operates a table motor controller <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which controls a motorized table <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to position patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Particularly, table <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> moves portions of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through gantry opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In a helical scan as performed in one embodiments of the present invention, table <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> moves while projection data is being collected and gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotating. The &ldquo;helical pitch&rdquo; is a measure of the amount of movement of table <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> per rotation of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for reading and writing onto removable media <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. For example, device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a floppy disk drive, a CD-R/W drive, or a DVD drive. Correspondingly, media <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is either a floppy disk, a compact disk, or a DVD. Device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and media <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are used in one embodiment to transfer acquired projection data from imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to another computer for further processing, or in another embodiment to input machine readable instructions that are processed by computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> segment of a coronary artery branch of patient is selected <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for imaging. A data compilation of coronary artery branch segments and their corresponding low motion cardiac phases is provided. Utilizing this data compilation, a low motion cardiac phase is selected <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the selected coronary artery branch segment. A volume of the heart of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then scanned <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to acquire projection data. The volume scanned includes at least the selected coronary artery branch segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> To facilitate image reconstruction, a rate of rotation of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is set according to the cardiac cycle of the heart of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, or to a measured average cardiac cycle rate. For example, computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used to detect occurrences of R peaks of an EKG measured by EKG machine <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The rotation rate of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is selected so that, at the same phase of different cardiac cycles, projection data is acquired from a variety of view angles. Projection data is collected from a sufficient range of view angles to reconstruct an image entirely from projection data acquired at the given cardiac phase. For a helical scan, a multislice detector array is used so that projection data at or near a plane of reconstruction (POR) is acquired by at least one detector row in different cardiac cycles as the scan proceeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the projection data acquired during a scan includes projection data acquired during the selected cardiac phase of a plurality of different cardiac cycles of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This acquired projection data is used to reconstruct <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> an image of at least the selected coronary artery branch segment. In one embodiment, to effectively reduce motion artifacts of the selected coronary artery branch segment in the reconstructed image, only that projection data acquired during the selected cardiac phase (i.e., the small, contiguous range of phases referred to above) is utilized, to the exclusion of other projection data. Because different portions of the heart undergo minimum displacement velocities at different cardiac phases, the reconstructed image may not be optimized for all parts of the heart appearing in the image in all cases. However, a relatively artifact-free image is obtained of the selected coronary artery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, projection data acquired during the selected cardiac phase is used together with other projection data to reconstruct an image. However, to effectively reduce motion artifacts of the selected coronary artery branch segment in the reconstructed image, weights are applied to the projection data to more heavily weight the projection data acquired during the selected cardiac phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Identification and selection of projection data corresponding to a selected cardiac phase is facilitated by the simultaneous recording of an EKG signal from EKG machine <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> during acquisition of the projection data. For example, R peaks in a signal from EKG machine <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are recorded and located by computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and views of the projection data are tagged with numbers representing cardiac phases as a percentage of time between R peaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although the cardiac periods of patients vary, a rest period of a particular segment of any given artery expressed as a percentage of a cycle type can be expected to be relatively constant. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, a data compilation of low motion cardiac phases corresponding to various coronary artery branch segments is derived from observations of a plurality of individuals. For example, low motion phases of a number of coronary arteries in different patients are observed from arteriograms collected from a plurality of individuals. The observed low motion phases (measured, for example, as a percent of a cardiac cycle from the most recent R peak of an EKG signal) are statistically combined, so that, for example, the data compilation contains low motion cardiac phases for each of the different observed cardiac artery branch segments, averaged over the plurality of patients observed. Methods such as those described by Wang et al. (&ldquo;Cardiac Motion of Coronary Arteries: Variability in the Rest Period and Implications for Coronary MR Angiography,&rdquo; Radiology 1999, 213:751-758) are suitable for assembling a catalog of rest periods for segments of a collection of arteries as a percentage of the R-peak-to-R-peak time of an EKG. The data compilation can include, but does not have to be based upon observations of the patient being scanned. Thus, in one embodiment, the data compilation is based upon observations of a plurality of individuals that exclude observations of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In some cases, low motion cardiac phases for different segments of the same coronary artery branch or of different coronary artery branches may be the same. In such cases, selection of a single low motion cardiac phase may suffice for artifact-free images of more than a single coronary artery branch segment. However, in some cases, it may be necessary or desirable to produce low artifact images of cardiac artery branch segments that have different low motion cardiac phases. Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> first cardiac phase corresponding to a low motion period of a first selected coronary artery branch segment of the heart of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is selected <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Also, a different, second cardiac phase corresponding to a second, different selected coronary artery branch segment is selected <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. A volume of the heart of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is scanned <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> using imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to acquire projection data. The volume scanned includes at least the first selected coronary artery branch segment and the second selected coronary artery branch segment. Imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thus acquires projection data that includes projection data representing the first selected coronary artery branch segment acquired during the first selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The acquired projection data also includes projection data representing the second selected coronary artery branch segment acquired during the second selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Using the acquired projection data, a single image including the first coronary artery branch segment and the second coronary artery branch segment of the heart of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is reconstructed <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The reconstruction selectively utilizes the projection data acquired during the first selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles to reduce motion artifacts of the first selected coronary artery branch segment on the single image. The reconstruction also selectively utilizes the projection data acquired during the second selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles to reduce motion artifacts of the second selected coronary artery branch segment on the single image. In one embodiment and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the selective utilization of projection data comprises reconstructing <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> a first image including the first selected coronary artery branch segment utilizing projection data obtained only during the first selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles. In addition, a second image is reconstructed <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> including the second selected coronary artery branch segment utilizing projection data obtained only during the second selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles. The first image provides a low motion artifact portion that includes the first selected coronary artery branch segment, and the second image provides a low motion artifact portion that includes the second selected coronary artery branch segment. The two images are selectively weighted and combined <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (e.g., &ldquo;morphed&rdquo;) into the single image. The weighting and combining is such that, in a portion of the single image containing the first selected coronary artery branch segment, the contribution of the first image predominates. Similarly, in a portion of the second image containing the second selected coronary artery branch segment, the contribution of the second image predominates. In this manner, motion artifacts of both selected coronary artery branch segments are effectively reduced in the reconstructed single image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the projection data is selectively combined by differentially weighting the projection data acquired during the two different selected cardiac phases so that projection data acquired during the first cardiac phase in a plurality of cardiac cycles contributes more heavily in reconstruction to a portion of the image in which the first selected cardiac artery branch segment appears.

Method <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes, scanning <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> a volume of the patient&apos;s heart with CT imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to acquire projection data, the volume including at least a first selected coronary artery branch segment and a second selected coronary artery branch segment, and the acquired projection data including a first projection dataset representing the first selected coronary artery branch segment acquired during the first selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles of the patient and a second projection dataset representing the second selected coronary artery branch segment acquired during the second selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles of the patient, and selecting <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> a first cardiac phase corresponding to a low motion period of the first selected coronary artery branch segment of a patient&apos;s heart and a different, second cardiac phase corresponding to the second, different selected coronary artery branch segment of the patient&apos;s heart. Method <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also includes reconstructing <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> a first 2D image of the first selected coronary artery branch segment utilizing the first projection dataset acquired during the first selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles to reduce motion artifacts of the first selected coronary artery branch segment, reconstructing <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> a second 2D image of the second selected coronary artery branch segment utilizing the second projection dataset acquired during the second selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles to reduce motion artifacts of the second selected coronary artery branch segment, and reconstructing <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at least one 3D image of the coronary artery utilizing the first 2D image and the second 2D image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, method <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes selecting <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> a first cardiac phase corresponding to a low motion period of a first selected coronary artery branch segment of a patient&apos;s heart and a different, second cardiac phase corresponding to a second, different selected coronary artery branch segment of the patient&apos;s heart, and scanning <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> a volume of the patient&apos;s heart with CT imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to acquire projection data, the volume including at least the first selected coronary artery branch segment and the second selected coronary artery branch segment, and the acquired projection data including a first projection dataset representing the first selected coronary artery branch segment acquired during the first selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles of the patient and a second projection dataset representing the second selected coronary artery branch segment acquired during the second selected cardiac phase of a plurality of cardiac cycles of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As described herein, for each cardiac segment, a different cardiac phase can be utilized to generate a plurality of 2D images representative of the plurality of artery branch segments at different phases. The plurality of 2D images are then combined to form a single 3D image representative of the coronary artery branch. For example, a first cardiac phase corresponding to a low motion period of a first desired coronary artery branch segment is used to reconstruct a first 2D image. A second cardiac phase corresponding to a low motion period of a second desired coronary artery branch segment is used to reconstruct a second 2D image of a patient&apos;s heart, and a third cardiac phase corresponding to a low motion period of a third desired coronary artery branch segment is used to reconstruct a third 2D image. The first 2D image of the first segment, the second 2D image of the second segment, and the third 2D image of the third segment are then combined to generate a single 3D image of the artery (i.e. all the segments combined). As described herein a plurality of 2D images of a plurality of segments are combined to form a 3D image. Also, as described herein the plurality of segments may include segments acquired during the same cardiac phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Method <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> facilitates allowing the operator to select the best segment, i.e. selecting the best phase or the low motion phase to reconstruct the 3D image of the coronary artery. The additional steps that are added to the above-described embodiments to extend their applicability to images having three or more selected coronary artery branch segments should, by now, be apparent to those skilled in the art. In general, an additional coronary artery phase is selected for each additional selected coronary artery branch segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and/or image reconstructor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, either alone or in combination, provide the processing power necessary to perform the computational steps described above in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Instructions for performing the computational steps and the compilation of low motion cardiac phases corresponding to different coronary artery branch segments are stored in an associated memory, such as mass storage device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, read only or read/write memory (not shown separately in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), or media <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In at least one embodiment of the present invention, a computer system separate from imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (for example, a workstation, not shown in the figures) is provided to reconstruct images using projection data acquired by imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In these embodiments, acquired projection data and corresponding cardiac phase information is transferred from imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the separate computer system via a network (not shown) or suitable media <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As a free-standing, separate computer system, these embodiments do not require a rotating gantry, a radiation source, or a detector array of their own. Also, these embodiments are configured to read or input projection data previously acquired by a CT imaging system. In other ways, they are configured in manners similar to the other apparatus embodiments discussed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the present invention include machine-readable media <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having recorded thereon instructions configured to instruct a computer system to perform steps of one or more of the methods described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiments will be recognized as achieving improved visualization of selected coronary artery branch segments as compared to known methods. Moreover, some of the above-described embodiments take into account variations in motion patterns between different coronary artery branch segments in a single image. These embodiments provide simultaneously improved visualization for both segments in a single image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated in detail, it is to be clearly understood that the same is intended by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation. In addition, the CT system described herein is a &ldquo;third generation&rdquo; system in which both the x-ray source and detector rotate with the gantry. However, many other CT systems including &ldquo;fourth generation&rdquo; systems wherein the detector is a full-ring or partial-ring stationary detector and an x-ray source could rotate with the gantry or includes distributed sources along a ring, along a line, or over an area, may be used. While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims. </paragraph>
