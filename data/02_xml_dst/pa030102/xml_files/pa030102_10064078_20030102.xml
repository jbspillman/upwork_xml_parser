<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates in general to a display, and more particularly, to a planar field emission display that prevents abnormal discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A display is a common apparatus in daily lives. An image is displayed to a user via a display. There are various kinds of displays, of which the cathode ray tube (CRT) is the most common one. However, the conventional cathode ray tube display occupies a large space. Lately, a liquid crystal display (LCD) occupying a smaller space has been developed. In addition, a field emission display applying the operation theory of cathode ray tube, but retaining the characteristics of liquid crystal display, has also been developed. The images of the field emission display are constructed by pixels, and the space occupied by the field emission display is smaller than that of cathode ray tube display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the operation theory of a conventional field emission display. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> micro-tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is formed on a resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A net column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is under the resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. On top of the micro-tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, there is a gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has a hole <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> allowing the tip of the micro-tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to be exposed. An anode plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed on the gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In addition to a display substrate, the anode plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further comprises a conductive layer and a fluorescent layer. The anode plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is made to conduct by applying a positive voltage to the conductive layer thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To discharge the micro-tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and display on the anode plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is grounded and a voltage is applied to the gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to induce the tip of the micro-tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to emit electrons. The emitted electrons are accelerated and attracted by the anode electrode plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to bombard the fluorescent layer of the anode plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which then emits fluorescent light. The fluorescent light transmits through the substrate to display the image pixels. The light beam of the pixels constructs an image. This display theory is similar to that of the cathode ray tube display. However, due to the different discharge structure and a thinner space, the field emission display is a planar display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the conventional field emission display, the formation of the cathode requires six photolithography and etching processes and six thin film deposition processes. Once formed, the cathode is sealed with the anode by a glass paste. A top view of the cathode of the field emission display is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. The cathode of the field emission display comprises a net column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has several micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> thereon. The micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are cone shaped structures, for example. At the same height of tips of the micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is formed. A hole <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> corresponding to the micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is formed in the gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. An insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed under the gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for isolation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view of the conventional field emission display cutting along the line I-I in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the conventional field emission display has a substrate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A net column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and covers the column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. An insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with openings exposing the resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed on the resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A micro-tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is disposed in the opening. Gate row lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are formed on the insulation layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are formed on the exposed resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the openings. Openings corresponding to the gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are formed around the tips of the micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The gate row lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are spaced with a distance. After formation of the cathode, an anode plate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed on the gate row lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with a vacuum space in between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Being induced by the gate row lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the tips of the micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> emit electrons.

During the process of bombardment by the electrons or the electron emission of the micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, residual formed on the micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may produce charged particles. Such charged particles falling on the silicon oxide between the gate row lines may cause charge accumulation. When the charge accumulation reaches a certain level, a short circuit or abnormal discharge on adjacent gate row lines may occur. The abnormal discharge occurs between an operating gate row line and adjacent non-operating gate row line. The voltage between an operating gate row line and adjacent non-operating gate row line causes the accumulated charges to discharge abnormally. The short circuit and the abnormal discharge on adjacent gate row lines damage the device. Consequently, defects like non-uniform brightness or open circuit of the field emission display may occur. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the insulation layer covering the area , which is not covered with the gate row lines of a cathode of a field emission display formed by six photolithography and etching processes, is removed to expose the underlying resistance layer. The method of removing the insulation layer includes etching. When the field emission display is operated, the excessive accumulated charges falling on the area between the gate row lines are grounded through the resistance layer or a ground line. Therefore, the short circuit and abnormal discharge occurring between the gate row lines are effectively avoided. The damage caused thereby is consequently prevented to enhance the endurance of the field emission display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The following is an embodiment to introduce the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view of a field emission display according to the embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the field emission display is similar to the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. The difference of the invention is the formation of a trench or opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that effectively prevents a short circuit or abnormal discharge from occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The field emission display of the present invention includes a cathode substrate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, for example, a silicon oxide glass. A column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is formed on the cathode substrate <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment, the column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is the net structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> such that a plurality of lumps appears in the cross-sectional view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is formed to cover the column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a doped silicon layer, for example. The doped silicon layer can be formed by deposition of a polysilicon layer, followed by a doping step. The doping step can also be performed in situ to forming the polysilicon layer. The resistance of the resistance layer depends on the doping level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> having a conical shape, for example, are formed on the resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are made of chromium (Cr), for example. An insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed, covering the resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is made of silicon oxide, for example. The tips of the micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be exposed. Openings are formed in the insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> such that the micro-tips <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> located in the openings of the insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are exposed. A conductive layer (not shown in FIGS.) is formed on the insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The conductive layer is patterned as a gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is under the gate row line <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While forming the cathode of the field emission display, other parts may be formed simultaneously. While forming the contact window, the insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> between the gate row lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is consequently removed to form an opening or a trench <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to expose the resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The formation of the trench <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is the key feature of the invention. There are several methods for forming the trench <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The function of the trench <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has been mentioned above. Redundant charges falling on the regions between the gate row lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as the resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is exposed to the redundant charges, are thus directed to the column line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> connected to ground via the resistance layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The accumulated charges are thus released from the spaces between the gate row lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the short circuit and abnormal discharge are effectively prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The method for implementing the invention includes removing the insulation layer <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> between the gate row lines <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> only. That is, no additional process is introduced and the problems of short circuit or abnormal discharge are effectively resolved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the invention will appear to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples to be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims. </paragraph>
