<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to calculators. Specifically, it relates to calculators used to compute the amount of the tip that user would want to leave after obtainment of such services as being served with food, getting a cab fare, and in any other circumstance when it is customary to leave a gratuity tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Almost everyone encounters a frequent need to leave a tip after a meal, after a cab ride, or after being served in other ways. Almost at every one of these occasions one has to pause and try to perform a mental calculation of just how much to tip. This problem is further complicated when a group of people are served, for example, at a dinner table in a restaurant. Now there is a need to calculate how much each person in the group has to pay for his or her meal and on top of it there is a need to calculate how much he or she should contribute to the tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a customary amount for the tip that is a certain percentage of the charge may vary from industry to industry. In addition, a person leaving a tip might want to leave a greater or lesser amount than what would be considered the norm depending on the degree of satisfaction with the service received. Existence of so many different mathematical problems in tip calculation often confuses people and may even embarrass those who are not comfortable with performing mathematical calculations in their head. Of course, one can always use a regular calculator, but the required calculations involve a number of steps that many people are unfamiliar with, while a majority of the public simply doesn&apos;t even carry calculators as they go about everyday business. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> All of these problems could be solved easily and conveniently with the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</cross-reference>, that is designed and pre-programmed to assist in performing of tip calculations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is comprised of a base member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The base member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a face side <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The face side <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a plurality of groupings of buttons. The plurality of groupings of buttons is comprised of a first grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a second grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a third grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The first grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes buttons designating whole numbers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> from &ldquo;0&rdquo; to &ldquo;9&rdquo;, and buttons designating at least mathematical functions <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of a decimal point (.), addition (&plus;), subtraction (&minus;), multiplication (&times;), division (/), and sum total (&equals;). The first grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used to enter in a bill amount and such entry could be done by a waiter or whoever else performed the service. The bill amount will appear on a main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The first grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> could also have such buttons as an on button <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> marked as &ldquo;ON/AC&rdquo; button for turning on of the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a clear button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> marked as &ldquo;C/CE&rdquo; button for clearing of the main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from any previously entered or obtained values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The first grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can also have an off button for turning off of the tips calculator. The off button is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</cross-reference> since in the shown preferred embodiments, the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> could have a timing mechanism for turning off of the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> after a certain time of non use, which mechanism has a construction that is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The first grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> could also be used for performing regular types of calculations performed with a calculator, thus providing a convenient two in one arrangement since the same device could be used as a regular calculator and as a tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The second grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes buttons designating tip amounts as percentages of the bill amount <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</cross-reference>. For example, there could be a button that has &ldquo;10%&rdquo; drawn on it, another button with &ldquo;11%&rdquo;, another with &ldquo;12%&rdquo; and so on, in one percent increments up to &ldquo;25%&rdquo; or some other appropriate limit for the highest tip. The user would see the bill amount on the main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and press a button that indicates the desired amount of tip percentage, for example a &ldquo;20%&rdquo; button. Each button designating a tip amount as a percentage of the bill amount <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the second grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is programmed to engage the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to perform a series of calculations, which calculate the tip amount for the chosen percent of the tip. In effect, if the bill amount was $100.00, a single press of a &ldquo;20%&rdquo; button will result in main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> showing &ldquo;20.00&rdquo; (result of 100.00&times;0.2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The second grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also includes a button for a total amount <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, which could be marked as &ldquo;TOTAL&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The total amount is a sum of the bill amount and the tip amount. A single press of the &ldquo;TOTAL&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will automatically add up the bill amount and the tip amount and display the sum on the main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In our example, the main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> would now show the total amount of &ldquo;120.00&rdquo; (result of 100.00&plus;20.00). Now the user knows how much money he or she should pay without trying to perform all the necessary calculations in his or her head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The above-described method of calculation of the tip amount by a single user is outlined in the flow chart of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The third grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is there to assist groups of people who are served together. The third grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes buttons designating numbers of members in a group <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as whole sequential numbers such as &ldquo;2&rdquo;, &ldquo;3 &rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo;, and so on up to &ldquo;<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&rdquo; or some other convenient number, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</cross-reference>. A single press of a button designating a number of members in a group <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the third grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will engage the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to compute an individual share, which is a product of a division of the total amount by the number of members in a group, and display the individual share on the main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, if the total amount to be paid together with a 20% tip was $120.00, and there were 4 people at the table dining together, then a single press of a &ldquo;4&rdquo; button in the third grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will engage the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to compute an individual share, and the main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will display &ldquo;30.00&rdquo; (result of 120&divide;4). Now each member of the four-person group would know that his or her share is $30.00 to be contributed to the total amount, which includes the bill amount and the tip amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The third grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> could also have a share button <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which could be marked as &ldquo;EACH&rdquo; button. In conjunction, the display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> would have a share display area <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Pressing of share button <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (marked as &ldquo;EACH&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</cross-reference>) prompts display of the individual share in the share display area <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> during performance of consecutive calculations on the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user can compare what his individual share would be if a different percentage of the tip was selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In order to clear the share display area <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the user can press the clear button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;C/CE&rdquo; button) clearing all values from the main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and pressing again of the clear button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> clearing all values from the share display area <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the user can press the on button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (&ldquo;ON/AC&rdquo; button) clearing all values from the main display area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and pressing again of the on button <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> clearing all values from the share display area <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The above-described method of calculation of the tip amount for each user in a group is outlined in the flow chart of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> All the programming and construction of the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> aimed at performing of functions and calculations designated by buttons in the plurality of groupings of buttons is accomplished by means well know in the art. Similarly, means for display of values, functions and results of calculations on the display screen <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a means well known in the art. Additionally, functioning of a necessary power source for the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is accomplished by means well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The dimensions of the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> could vary. In one preferred embodiment, the base member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> could have a size and shape that allows for convenient placement inside of a check presentation book. The waiter would enter the bill total on the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using the buttons in the first grouping of buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and present the check in the check presentation book. Upon opening of the check presentation book, the user only has to press a few buttons on the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to know how much to pay with tip added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the base member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> could also have a credit card size, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which allows for easy storage in a wallet. With tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> always at hand in the wallet of the user, calculation of a tip for a taxi ride or a haircut is now a simple and convenient task since calculation steps have been simplified. Also, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the base member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> could have an oblong &ldquo;ruler&rdquo; shape, which has an added advantage of serving a function of a ruler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the face side <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the base member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the tips calculator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> could have an advertisement area <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for display of an advertisement information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It will be further understood that the embodiments described herein are merely exemplary and that a person skilled in the art may make variations and modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. All such variations and modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
