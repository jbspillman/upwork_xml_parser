<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a blow-by gas separator and more particularly to an improved separation system for use with internal combustion engines in connection with crankcase gas recirculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In order to improve the emission qualities of internal combustion engines, they have been provided with recirculated crankcase ventilation systems wherein the blow-by gases from the crankcase are returned to the combustion chambers for further combustion of undesirable constituents such as hydrocarbons. The conventional type of system employs a combined oil separator and oil return device that receives the crankcase gases and separates oil from them with the separated oil being returned to the crankcase chamber. The thus purified crankcase gases are then delivered to the induction system for introduction into the combustion chambers wherein any unburned hydrocarbons that have not been separated can be reduced by further combustion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> are cross sectional views taken through a portion of the induction system utilized in conventional engines wherein the crankcase ventilation system is shown partially and identified generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The crankcase ventilation system <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes an oil separator, indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This oil separator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is positioned in a first conduit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that receives crankcase gases from the crankcase ventilation system via a positive crankcase ventilation valve, which is not shown in this figure, in the flow direction indicated by the arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The oil separator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is comprised of an outer housing that defines an oil separating chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which functions to remove oil from the blow-by gases in any suitable manner. In these and subsequent figures, a centrifugal type separator is depicted wherein the crankcase gases are delivered in a tangential direction to the chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so that the swirling will cause oil to deposit on the inner wall of the chamber. Of course, there are other types of oil separators with which this invention can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The crankcase gases from which the oil is separated are then returned to the induction system through the conduit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and specifically through a return path <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that flows in a direction indicated by the arrow B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> At the lower end of the separation chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, there is provided an oil accumulating or oil return chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> communicates with the lower part of the separator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through a flow opening <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which is valved by a drain valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The drain valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is pressure responsive and opens and closes in response to differences in the pressure in the chambers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (intake pressure and crankcase pressure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The oil return chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, in turn, has a discharge opening that communicates with the crankcase chamber through an oil return line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. This opening is controlled by a pressure responsive valve <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which, in most instances, is of the duck bill type and will open in response to pressure differences between the oil reservoir <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the oil return line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Basically, the theory of operation is that as the engine is running, oil will be separated in the oil separator chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and under some running conditions will flow to the return chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> when the pressure responsive valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is opened as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Under other running conditions, the pressure in the oil return chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will be greater than the pressure in the crankcase chamber and return line <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the check valve <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> will open and the oil will be returned to the crankcase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the desired performance does not always occur under all running conditions and with all engines, particularly with engines where pressure in the induction system can at times be greater than atmospheric. This happens with supercharged engines of various forms such as turbocharged engines although it may occur in other types of engines as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The problem with this type of construction can be best understood by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> showing the condition in a normal engine having a pressurized induction system such as a turbocharged engine when operating at idle. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the condition when operating under full load with the throttle open. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows how the problem can arise with this type of construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the engine is operating at idle, the crankcase ventilating gases from the PCV valve are delivered through the conduit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the separator chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as shown by the arrow A. When this occurs, the pressure in the intake manifold is in the range of &minus;70 to &minus;60 kPa. At that time, the pressure in the crankcase chamber and the conduit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> will be in the range of &minus;0.2 to 0 kPa. Thus, under this condition, the pressure in the crankcase chamber is always higher than the pressure in the intake chamber and hence, the pressure responsive valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will be opened and oil can flow through the passage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to accumulate in the oil return chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as shown by the shaded area indicated in the oil in this figure. As a result, no oil will be accumulating in the separator chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and oil free crankcase ventilating gases will be returned to the induction system so that any hydrocarbons that are present can be burned by further combustion in the combustion chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As the load on the engine increases and the throttle valve is opened, the pressure in the intake manifold and hence, conduit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can rise to pressures in the range of &minus;50 to &plus;90 kPa. Under the same conditions, the crankcase chamber pressure ranges from &minus;6.5 to &plus;0.5 kPa. When this occurs, the check valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will close as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and when the pressure in the crankcase chamber is below the trapped pressure in the oil reservoir chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the drain check valve <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> will open and oil can flow to the crankcase. This does not occur, under all running conditions, however. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, there may exist a condition where oil has been accumulated in the return chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as shown in FIG.<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but the pressure in the induction system is high enough to close the pressure response valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> before the drain check valve <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has had a chance to open. As a result, further oil will accumulate in the separator chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and this oil can then pass into the induction system, a condition which is not desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, a principal object to this invention to providean improved crankcase ventilation system including an improved blow-by gas separator wherein it will be insured that oil cannot accumulate in the separator chamber under any running conditions so that the oil is totally precluded from being able to pass into the induction system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> This invention is adapted to be embodied in a crankcase ventilation oil separator for an internal combustion engine. The separator comprises a housing defining an oil separation chamber having a blow-by inlet receiving crankcase blow-by gasses from the associated engine. A separated gas return delivers gasses from which oil has been separated to an induction system of the associated engine. A separated oil receiving chamber is formed at a lower portion of the oil separation chamber for receiving oil separated from the crankcase blow-by gasses. An oil return passage is formed in a lower portion of the separated oil receiving chamber communicating with the crankcase of the associated engine. The oil return passage includes a flow opening for providing the communication with the crankcase of the associated engine. A pressure responsive flow control valve controls the flow through the flow opening. The pressure responsive valve comprises a first valve element disposed on one side of the flow opening and a second, interconnected valve element disposed on the other side of the flow opening. The first valve element restricts the flow opening when the pressure in the oil separating chamber is greater than the pressure in the oil return passage, The second valve element restricts the flow opening when the pressure in the oil return passage is greater than the pressure in the oil separating chamber.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now in detail to the drawings and initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, these are cross sectional views taken through a single cylinder of an internal combustion engine constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, which engine is indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Basically, except for the crankcase ventilation system and the oil separator therefore, the engine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be of any general type and although the invention has particular utility in conjunction with engines that are either supercharged by turbo charging or otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes a cylinder block assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in which a plurality of cylinder bores are formed. Although the described embodiment illustrates an in-line engine, it should be readily apparent that the engine may be of any type including V-type or opposed engines and engines having any number of cylinders. At the lower end of the cylinder block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> there is formed a crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in which lubricant is contained at a level indicated at <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A crankshaft <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> driven by the pistons of the engine through connecting rods is rotatably journalled in the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> in a known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A cylinder head assembly, indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, is affixed to the cylinder block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in a suitable manner, including an integral construction. The cylinder head assembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> contains the intake and exhaust valves for the engine, which are not shown, and which are operated by camshafts contained within cam chambers <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> associated with an exhaust camshaft <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and an intake camshaft <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is provided with an induction system many components of which are shown schematically for the aforenoted reasons (ie., they may be of any desired type). This includes an air inlet device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that may include a filter and which supplies this atmospheric air to the inlet side of a turbocharger, indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, through an intake pipe <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The turbocharger <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is driven by an exhaust turbine as is well known in this art and compresses the inducted air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The compressed air is discharged through the turbocharger outlet <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to an intake manifold plenum chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. This plenum chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has individual runner sections <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> that extend to the intake ports of the engine, which are valved by the aforenoted poppet valves, controlled by the intake camshaft <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Lubricating oil is circulated through the engine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in any appropriate manner. The engine body is provided with a pair of communication passages <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> on the exhaust and intake sides respectively that communicate the valve chambers <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and which permit return oil to flow thereto as well as ventilating air circulation, as will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The turbocharger <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may be also lubricated and it has a return path <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> that extends from its lubricant sump back to the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The engine <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is provided with a crankcase ventilating system which includes a PVC valve <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that is mounted in an exhaust cam cover <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> fixed over and clothing the exhaust cam chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. This PVC valve <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> delivers blow-by gases as shown by the solid line arrows to a pair of conduits <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> which extend to the inlet and outlet sides of an oil separator, indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and which has a construction as will be described shortly by reference to either <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The conduit <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> delivers the ventilating gases back to the intake system for example to the intake runners <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> or any other appropriate location as is known in this art. Oil removed by the separator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is returned, in a manner to be described, to the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> through a return conduit <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The ventilating system includes a further ventilating path which is operates to provide atmospheric air to the engine under certain running conditions such as idle or less than wide open throttle. This includes an inlet conduit <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that extends from a second oil separator, also indicated by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and second conduit <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, which communicates with the intake camshaft chamber <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> For oil draining purposes, an oil drain <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> extends from the second vapor separator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the supercharger return line <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and, accordingly, to the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Under these other certain running conditions, all of the ventilating air will flow through both of these paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when operating under wide open throttle when the intake manifold pressure is higher than the crankcase chamber pressure the flow path is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In this condition, the intake air for the ventilating system is delivered through the PVC valve <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> a shown by the white arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> from the first vapor separator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> disposed on the intake side of the engine. This atmospheric air is drawn from the intake system and specifically one or more of the intake manifold runners <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and flows through the conduits <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> into the exhaust cam chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> through the PVC valve <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Under this condition, the blow-by gases are delivered to the induction system upstream of the turbocharger <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> through the passages <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the second oil separator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> associated with the exhaust side of the engine. Thus, it should be radially apparently that the construction permits a very effective flow of filtered atmospheric air to the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for ventilation under all running conditions and also insures that any oil contained in the crankcase gases that are discharged back into the induction system will be separated by either or both of the separators <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The construction of one embodiment of the separators <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> will now be described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, the separator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is identified generally by the same reference numeral and includes an outer housing that forms an oil separation chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that communicates with the engine ventilation system through conduits indicated generally at <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. In the case of the vapor separator associated with the exhaust chamber <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, these includes the conduits <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> while if it is the separator <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> associated with the intake chamber <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, it would include the conduits <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The former numbers are employed in the description of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Unlike the prior art arrangements, the lower end of the oil separation chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> communicates with a valve mechanism, indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which includes an internal chamber that is divided into an upper portion and a lower portion by a dividing wall <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> having a flow opening <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> formed therein. The upper of these two portions above the wall <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> communicates with the discharge end of the oil separating chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> through a restricted by un-valved opening <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. The lower portion below the wall <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> communicates with a discharge nipple <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which communicates with either of the oil return passages <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> of the previously mentioned constructions in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> and thus returns oil to the crankcase chamber <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The valve mechanism <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> further includes an upper disk valve <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and a lower disk valve <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> that are interconnected to each other in spaced relationship by a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that passes through the opening <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> with a substantial clearance. Under normal idle operation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the crankcase pressure is greater than the induction system pressure and the valve disk <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> is held in flow restricting position with the underside of the wall <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and, in this embodiment, completely closes the opening <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Thus, the separated oil will accumulate as indicated by the oil level &ldquo;Oil&rdquo; in this figure. However, the amount of accumulated oil is such that the oil will be separated from the separator chamber <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by the restricted opening <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. Thus this separated oil cannot reenter the induction system for ventilating air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Under normal running off idle as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the valve disk will be moved between the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Thus, for the most part the passage <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> will be maintained opened and can drain oil. Even during those periods when it is closed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the amount of accumulated oil will be relatively small and still well below the opening <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> so reentry to the ventilating air is not permitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 11</cross-reference> shows another embodiment, which is substantially the same as embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</cross-reference>. For that reasons, components of this embodiment, which are the same, have been identified by the same reference numerals and will not be described again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the condition shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is precluded by providing a small slotted opening <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> on the upper surface of the wall <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> from an area radially outwardly beyond the periphery of the valved disk <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> so that even when the valve is in its flow restricting position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an oil drain clearance <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will be provided so that oil can continue to drain. Thus no oil will be accumulated that could in any way enter the ventilating air system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Thus, from the foregoing description, it should be readily apparent that the described embodiments of the invention provide a very effective oil separation system for the crankcase ventilation of an engine and particularly one such as a supercharged engine when at times the intake manifold pressure may be greater than the pressure in the crankcase chamber. Thus, the problem of oil accumulation with the previously proposed types of devices are avoided. Of course, the foregoing description is that of preferred embodiments of the invention and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
