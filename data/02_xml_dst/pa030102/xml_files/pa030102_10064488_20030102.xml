<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The Strainer Drainer/Colander Caddy is a means of elevating strainers/colanders (either in the form of removable/detachable/foldable/collapsible legs or base or as a separate universal fitting device) in a stable fashion, built using either food grade or non-food grade materials, while providing drainage for strainers/colanders in order to minimize the risk of food stuffs becoming contaminated by the backup of waters in a sink/basin. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The basic strainer/colander is a tool which was invented long ago and for which there is no longer patent protection other than design patents that are issued from time to time. The problem with the tool is that, over time, improvements have not been made to account for its modern day use in sinks/basins while still being of a size to fit in dishwashing machines. Typically, the tool comes with permanently attached legs or a base upon which it rests. The drawback is that the legs or base cannot be of a length which affords sufficient protection from coming into contact with fluids that may back up in a sink or basin due to inadequate drainage rates. Were sufficient legs or base added to afford protection, the tool would no longer conveniently fit into dishwashers (particularly the top rack as may be recommended for many plastics). In addition, larger permanent legs or base would necessarily consume additional storage space, a commodity in most kitchens. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention is the creation of a non-permanent base for strainer/colanders in two ways: First, the creation of a portable and universal device separate and apart from existing strainers/colanders which provides an adequate base to support food strainers/colanders and stably elevate such devices while providing adequate drainage for the strainer/colander and thereby prevent the contamination of the food products contained in the strainer/colander from fluids which may not otherwise be capable of adequately draining in a time or manner which would prevent such unsanitary contact. Second, the creation and use of a new strainer/colander which incorporates either removable, detachable, foldable or collapsible legs or base which provides an adequate base to support the strainer/colander and elevate it while providing adequate drainage thereby preventing contamination of the food products contained in the strainer/colander from fluids which may not otherwise be capable of adequately draining in a time or manner which would prevent such unsanitary contact. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The first five devices depicted (numbered <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) in the drawings are exemplars of potential designs that the claimed art can be created for the universal, separate device described in claims 1, 3 and 4. For the detachable, removable, foldable or collapsible legs or base, described in claims 2, 3 and 4, the last depicted device (numbered <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) depicts one such new strainer/colander with folding legs (shown in the folded position). In addition, the first five devices depicted could be used as an attachment to the new type of strainer/colander described in claims 2, 3 and 4 by either: pressure fitting, tongue-in-grove with pressure release or release tab(s), threads, collapsible inserts, or removable or foldable legs that insert and are held in place by any of the foregoing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This is a kitchen accessory device which uses either food grade or non-food grade material to elevate food strainers/colanders in sinks/basins so as to avoid the risk of overflow waters backing up in the sink/basin drain and creating an unsanitary condition by contaminating the food products in the strainer/colander in a manner such as is claimed and described in this application and for which exemplars are depicted in the drawings which form part of this submission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the claims, descriptions, and drawings of this submission are merely exemplary and that a person or company analyzing the art may make many variations, stylistic changes, and modifications without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention. For example, there are many materials from which the invention may be constructed, including plastics, metals, woods, etc. In addition, the shape of the device by which the elevation and drainage is provided could easily be modified (circle, square, hexagon, octagon, oblong, hourglass, etc.) without significantly altering the use of the invention which is claimed. All such modifications, stylistic changes, variations, and modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>

<subdoc-claims>
<claim id="CLM-00001">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. We claim the creation and use of a portable and universal device (made from either food grade or non food grade materials) separate and apart from existing strainers/colanders which provides an adequate base to support food strainers/colanders and elevate such devices while providing adequate drainage for the strainer/colander and thereby prevent the contamination of the food products contained in the strainer/colander from fluids which may not otherwise be capable of adequately draining in a time or manner which would prevent such unsanitary contact. </claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00002">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. We claim the creation and use of a new strainer/colander (made from food-grade materials) which incorporates either removable, detachable, foldable, or collapsible legs or base attachment (made from either food grade or non food grade materials) which provides an adequate base to support food strainers/colanders and elevate such devices while providing adequate drainage for the strainer/colander and thereby prevent the contamination of the food products contained in the strainer/colander from fluids which may not otherwise be capable of adequately draining in a time or manner which would prevent such unsanitary contact. </claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00003">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. We claim that the height of such devices being such that the strainer/colander is elevated more than 1.1 inches from the surface on which it rests for purposes of stability and affording sufficient elevation to allow for adequate drainage and, as to the universal device, being greater than 3.0 inches in diameter on the top and greater than 3.25 inches in diameter on the bottom for purposes of stability and affording a universal fit to both sink/basin drains and strainers/colanders. </claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00004">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. We claim the devices as set forth in the drawings of this submission, which are merely exemplary, recognizing that a person or company analyzing the art may make many variations, stylistic changes, and modifications without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention. For example, there are many materials from which the invention may be constructed, including plastics, metals, woods, etc. In addition, the shape of the device by which the elevation and drainage is provided could easily be modified (circle, square, hexagon, octagon, oblong, hourglass, etc.) without significantly altering the use of the invention which is claimed. All such modifications, stylistic changes, variations, and modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention and are hereby claimed. </claim-text>
