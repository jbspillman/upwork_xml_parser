<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Described is a vehicle roof for a passenger car or the like with a roof panel and with the peculiarity that the longitudinal side of the roof panel (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is designed with fixtures (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), formed out of the roof plane, for the fastening arrangement of roof-load crossmembers (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a vehicle roof for a passenger car (limousine, coupe, station wagon, van, or minibus) with a roof panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Roof load supports are frequently installed on the roof panel of passenger cars of the aforementioned kind in order to transport very different kinds of objects. On passenger cars of the older generation, the fastening arrangement of roof load supports was located on the drip rails (DE 27 10 222 A1), which are no longer common in modern vehicles. The modern arrangement of roof load supports on a vehicle roof generally provides for roof rails, which are permanently attached to a vehicle roof and to which detachable roof load crossmembers can be attached (DE 28 04 588 A1). A roof rail of the cited art usually consists of at least one boom on each side of the roof and at least two railing feet, each of which carries a boom. The booms and feet are stuck together for assembly and the feet are equipped with threaded bolts whose extended ends are fed through borings in the roof panel. Nuts are attached onto the threaded bolts from the other side of the roof panel (DE C4 004 829). The cost of manufacturing a conventional roof rail is considerable, as is its assembly. Well known is the arrangement of fastening two rails along the longitudinal side regions of the roof panel (DE 198 03 232 A1) and fitting detachable roof rail crossmembers to them. Here too, there is a high expense for manufacturing the rails and assembling them with their sealing problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Starting with a vehicle roof of the art cited in the introduction, it is the objective of the invention to take precautions that the arrangement of roof load crossmembers on a passenger car&apos;s roof panel is accomplished much more easily and at less expense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To solve this task, it is provided according to invention that the longitudinal sides of the roof panel are designed with materially uniform fixtures, which are shaped upwards from the roof panel, consist of beads issuing upwards, and almost extend across the roof panel&apos;s entire length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The special advantage of the invention consists of the fact that the fixtures are no longer rails or bars that are separately manufactured and mounted, but integral components of the vehicle roof, designed as the same piece and materially uniform with the roof panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The beads issuing upwards can be manufactured at completely neutral cost and in the same working cycle with the forming work of the roof panel, which must be performed anyway, and they provide the additional advantage of stiffening the roof. Due to the fact that the fixtures, which are designed as beads, extend along nearly the entire length of the roof panel, nearly any desired fastening arrangement for the roof load crossmembers is possible along the entire length of the bead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Fasteners, such as the claws of the roof load crossbeams, can lock to the fixtures with positive fit in that, in the development of the invention, the fixtures feature, at least in the regions of the crossmember/fastening arrangements, impressions that prevent the crossmembers from shifting in the event of an accident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To prevent deformation or other damage to the fixtures, another further development of the invention provides that the fixtures designed as beads are internally stiffened with formed pieces inserted or infused into them.</paragraph>
</summary-of-invention>
<brief-description-of-drawings>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To take into account an effort of car manufacturers to make more extensive use of modular components in the future, another further development of the invention consists of that the roof panel, which is designed with fixtures for the fastening arrangement of roof load crossbeams, forms a prefabricated assembly unit in combination with a roofliner attached to it. Here the roofliner may be fitted with a roofliner covering, and/or interior trim paneling, sun visors, inside rearview mirror, interior lighting devices, cabling, control and display units, sliding roof or sunroof and its framework and driving elements, supporting straps, etc. It is recommended that the prefabricated assembly unit feature a connecting configuration that fits the locations of the pillars&apos; joints and/or the vehicle body&apos;s roof frame. An example of the invention will be explained in more detail based on the drawing. The drawing shows: </paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The vehicle roof features a roof panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which, on its longitudinal side regions of which only one is illustrated, possesses fixtures <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> shaped upwards for a fastening arrangement of sustainers or claws <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of roof load crossmembers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The drawing only illustrates one roof load crossmember <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with one claw <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Every fixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> consists of a bead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the roof panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issuing upwards and is thus an integrated component of the roof panel. To produce a connection with positive fit between each claw <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and each fixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the beads <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> each feature an impression <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which a corresponding claw projection engages locking tightly. The impression <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may also extend across nearly the entire length of bead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. An undesired deformation of fixture <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which could occur front the claws <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> splitting open too strongly, can be prevented by arranging a formed piece <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> within each bead <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The roof panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fastened to a side-panel frame <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> belonging to the vehicle body by a fastening arrangement formed by gluing, soldering, welding, screwing, or riveting. A weatherstrip, which isn&apos;t illustrated, or another sealant may be arranged between the roof panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the side frame <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The vehicle roof additionally features the peculiarity, that it may consist of one roof module as illustrated that also features fixtures <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the fastening arrangement of roof load crossmembers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the example, the roof module consists of the roof panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the fixtures <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a roofliner <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and an intermediate layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between roof panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and roofliner <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The roof module consequently features a sandwich construction, wherein the intermediate layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of plastic foam, for example. Glued joints can be provided between roof panel <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and intermediate layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on one side, as well as between the intermediate layer and the roof liner <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the other side, wherein both physically-binding and chemically-binding adhesives can be used. A roof frame or pillar lining <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be attached to the roof lining <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, as shown in the drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It must also be mentioned that the beads <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> also serve as styling elements of a roof rail, and that the fixtures formed by the beads <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> produce a positive side effect to the extent that they prevent rainwater located on the vehicle roof from penetrating into the passenger compartment when the door is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Although not presented in detail, the roof module may feature one or more add-on pieces in pre-assembled arrangement. Roofliner covering, interior trim paneling, sun visors, interior lighting devices, supporting straps, etc. constitute examples. </paragraph>
