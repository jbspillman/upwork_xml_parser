<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an audio signal processing and reproducing method for processing and reproducing an audio signal while adjusting a sound quality of a music reproduced by the audio signal, an audio signal processing apparatus for processing an audio signal with sound quality controlling information indicating various sound qualities of a music reproduced by the audio signal, a recording medium for recording an audio signal with sound quality controlling information indicating various sound qualities of a music reproduced by the audio signal, and an audio signal reproducing apparatus for reproducing an audio signal while adjusting a music reproduced by the audio signal to a desired sound quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Also, the present invention relates to an audio signal processing and reproducing method for processing and reproducing an audio signal while reducing a volume of data indicating the audio signal, an audio signal processing apparatus for processing an audio signal while reducing a volume of data indicating the audio signal, a recording medium for recording an audio signal in which a volume of data indicating the audio signal is reduced, and an audio signal reproducing apparatus for reproducing an audio signal processed to reduce a volume of data indicating the audio signal. Also, the present invention relates to an audio signal processing and reproducing method for processing and reproducing an audio signal while adjusting an output level of the audio signal, an audio signal processing apparatus for processing an audio signal with a test tone signal to automatically mute an output sound of the test tone signal in a reproducing operation of the audio signal, a recording medium for recording an audio signal with a test tone signal, and an audio signal reproducing apparatus for reproducing an audio signal with a test tone signal while adjusting an output level of the audio signal and muting an output sound of the test tone signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2.1. FIRST PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED ART: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In general, in cases where an audio signal recorded in a recording medium such as a compact disk (or disc) (CD) or a digital versatile disk (or disc) (DVD) is reproduced by using a speaker, a user can entertain a music reproduced by the audio signal at a desired sound quality when the user manually operates an equalizer of an audio signal reproducing apparatus to appropriately adjust a level of each frequency band such as a low tone or a high tone, a balance of levels of frequency bands, a level balance of speakers of five channels (or right and left channels) and reverberation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 2.2. SECOND PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED ART: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a first conventional audio signal reproducing method, when a digital audio signal is written in a CD or DVD as an original signal, a level of the original signal is generally heightened to improve a sound/noise (SIN) ratio in the original signal. Also, in cases where a level of an original signal read out from the CD or DVD is too high, the level of the original signal is lowered in a reproducing operation to prevent the original signal from giving an unpleasant feeling to a listener or to prevent a speaker from being broken. In this case, a user can reproduce the original signal at a desired level by manually adjusting the level of the original signal in the reproducing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, in a second conventional audio signal reproducing method, when a test tone recorded in a disk (or disc) at a maximum level for each channel of a stereo or multichannel is reproduced, an operator manually mutes an output sound including the test tone and manually adjusts the balance of levels of the test tones in a plurality of channels while observing the levels indicated in a level meter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 2.3. PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, when the user entertains a music at a desired sound quality, the user is required to manually operate many buttons for appropriately adjusting a level of each frequency band, a balance of levels of frequency bands, a level balance of speakers of five channels and reverberation. Also, to appropriately adjust the buttons, a skillful person having a superior keen sense of hearing such as a professional mixer is required. Therefore, the user cannot hear a music at a desired sound quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Also, in the first conventional audio signal reproducing method, because a level of an original digital audio signal is shifted and the signal is recorded, the user is required to adjust the level of the signal when the user reproduces the signal at an original level thereof. Therefore, there is a drawback that the digital audio signal cannot be automatically reproduced at the original level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Also, in the second conventional audio signal reproducing method, because it is required to record one test tone in each of all recording blocks of a disk (or disc), a recording area of the disk (or disc) cannot be efficiently used for digital recording signals. To prevent this drawback, there is an idea that each of test tones is recorded in an area of the disk (or disc) with a mute flag and an output of an audio signal for which one mute flag is set is muted. In this idea, the burden for watching the mute flags is increased in an audio signal reproducing apparatus when an occurrence frequency of the mute flags is heightened. For example, one mute flag is set for each frame ({fraction (1/600)} second). Also, when an occurrence frequency of the mute flag is lowered, a fine mute control for the audio signal cannot be performed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> audio signal encoding means for adding a plurality of pieces of sound quality control information, which each denote information for adjusting a sound quality of a music indicated by the analog audio signal, to the digital audio signal and encoding the digital audio signal and the pieces of sound quality control information to produce packed data, the packed data being transmitted or recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the above steps and configuration, a plurality of pieces of sound quality control information are added to a digital audio signal obtained from an analog audio signal indicating a music. Because each piece of sound quality control information denotes information for adjusting a sound quality of the music and the digital audio signal is recorded with the pieces of sound quality control information as packed data, when a user selects a piece of particular sound quality control information from the pieces of sound quality control information after the packed data is read out, levels of the pieces of audio data of the digital audio signal are adjusted according to the particular sound quality control information, and a sound quality adjusted digital audio signal is obtained. </paragraph>

Therefore, even though the original levels of the pieces of PCM audio data are shifted to the shifted levels in the audio signal processing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the shifted levels of the pieces of level-shifted PCM audio data can be automatically returned to the original levels of the pieces of PCM audio data. Here, because the audio-CONT packs including the level shift control data are basically arranged at regular intervals of the audio time of 0.5 second, the differential level (0&minus;Lmax<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) can be automatically adjusted for each 0.5 second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, in the equalizing unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the level balance control unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the reverberation control unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>the original levels of the pieces of PCM digital audio data are changed to set a music indicated by the analog audio signal input to the audio signal processing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a user&apos;s desired sound quality, and a sound quality adjusted PCM digital audio signal composed of a series of sound quality adjusted PCM audio data are produced in the level and sound quality control unit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Thereafter, because the pushing of the mute button <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>currently performed by the user indicates the mute instruction, the mute control is selected, and the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is set to a &ldquo;ON&rdquo; condition in a step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. That is, the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is set to an operation condition. Therefore, an output sound of the sound quality adjusted analog audio signals is muted in the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, so that the user cannot listen to a music. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the user can manually and alternately select the performance of mute control and the no-performance of mute control by pushing the mute button <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Also, in cases where the pushing of the mute button <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is not judged in the step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, it is judged in a step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> whether or not a mute flag Fm arranged in an A-CONT pack is detected. Because a plurality of A-CONT packs are arranged at normal intervals of 0.5 second, the mute flag is detected every 0.5 second. In cases where any mute flag is not detected, the judgement in the step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is repeated. In contrast, in cases where a mute flag Fm is detected in the step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, a mute control based on the mute flag is started in this current routine. That is, it is judged in a step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> whether the mute flag Fm is equal to 1 or 0. In cases where the mute flag Fm&equals;1 is satisfied because the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> set to the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; condition is required. It is judged in a step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> whether a previous mute flag Fpm stored in the previous mute flag buffer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is equal to 1 or 0. In cases where the previous mute flag Fpm&equals;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is satisfied, because the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> has been already set to the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; condition in a previous routine of the mute control, even though the mute flag Fm&equals;1 instructs the operation of the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in this current routine, the setting of the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; condition in the step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is not required. Therefore, the mute flag Fm is stored in the previous mute flag buffer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as a previous mute flag Fpm currently defined in a step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and the current routine is finished. The previous mute flag Fpm currently defined is used for a next routine of a mute control based on a next mute flag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in cases where the previous mute flag Fpm&equals;0 is satisfied in the step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, because the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is set to the &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition in a previous routine of the mute control, the mute flag Fm is stored in the previous mute flag buffer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as a previous mute flag Fpm currently defined in a step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is set to the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; condition in the step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the current routine is finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> Also, in cases where the mute flag Fm&equals;0 is satisfied in the step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> because the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> set to the &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition is required in this current routine, it is judged in a step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> whether a previous mute flag Fpm stored in the previous mute flag buffer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is equal to 1 or 0. In cases where the previous mute flag Fpm&equals;0 is satisfied, because the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> has been already set to the &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition in a previous routine of the mute control, even though the mute flag Fm&equals;0 instructs the stopping of the operation of the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in this current routine, the setting of the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to the &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition in the step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is not required. Therefore, the mute flag Fm is stored in the previous mute flag buffer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as a previous mute flag Fpm currently defined in a step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, and the current routine is finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in cases where the previous mute flag Fpm&equals;1 is satisfied in the step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, because the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is set to the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; condition in a previous routine of the mute control, the mute flag Fm is stored in the previous mute flag buffer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> as a previous mute flag Fpm currently defined in a step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is set to the &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition in the step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the current routine is finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in cases where the mute flag Fm&equals;1 arranged in one A-CONT pack is detected, because one series of test tone data is arranged in one of audio packs following the A-CONT pack, the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> can be automatically set to the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; condition to mute an output sound of the test tone signal obtained from the series of test tone data. Therefore, there is no probability that an output sound of the test tone signal gives an unpleasant feeling to the user, the speaker is broken or the user has a pain in his ear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Also, in cases where the mute flag Fm&equals;0 arranged in one A-CONT pack is detected, because a series of test tone data is not arranged in any audio pack following the A-CONT pack, the mute circuit <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> can be automatically set to the &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; condition to output a music indicated by a plurality of analog audio signals relating to a plurality of series of user data which are arranged in a plurality of audio packs following the A-CONT pack. Therefore, the user can entertain the music without being disturbed by the test tone signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Also, because a plurality of A-CONT packs are arranged at normal intervals of 0.5 second, a mute flag arranged in each A-CONT pack is detected every 0.5 second. Therefore, the burden of the control unit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> for observing the occurrence of the mute flag in the DVD decoding circuit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> can be reduced as compared with the observation performed for each frame ({fraction (1/600)} second) in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Next, a modification of the third embodiment is described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, an audio signal reproducing apparatus <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> comprises the demodulating circuit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the DVD decoding circuit <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, the displaying unit <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the operating unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the control circuit <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the previous mute flag buffer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the mute button flag buffer <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, the data memory <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> a level meter <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> for indicating levels of the sound quality adjusted PCM digital audio signals obtained in the signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for each channel, </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> the D/A converter <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the low pass filter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the deciphering unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> In the above configuration, because an output sound of a digital audio signal relating to the test tone signal is automatically muted, the user can easily adjust levels of the sound quality adjusted PCM digital audio signals without any unpleasant feeling based on the output of the test tone signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Having illustrated and described the principles of the present invention in a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles.
