<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a disposable body fluid absorbent wearing article such as a disposable diaper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application No. 1995-112003A discloses a disposable absorbent pad comprising a pad itself and an elastic waist band. This absorbent pad comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet, a liquid-impervious backsheet and a liquid-absorbent core disposed between these two sheets wherein respective end regions of end flaps extending outward beyond longitudinally opposite ends of the core are connected to the elastic waist band. The absorbent pad is formed with side flaps transversely extending from the pad and being elastically stretchable in longitudinal direction thereof. These side flaps are folded back at least partially in the longitudinal direction toward the inner side of the absorbent pad. This absorbent pad of well known art is described to ensure that the pad itself comes in close contact with the wearer&apos;s skin between groins of the wearer&apos;s thighs as the elastic waist band is put around the wearer&apos;s waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Japanese Patent Application No. 1995-155344A discloses disposable pants comprising a stretchable pants-member and a pad member. The pad member comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet, a liquid-impervious backsheet and a liquid-absorbent core disposed between these two sheets wherein end flaps and side flaps extend from longitudinally opposite ends and transversely opposite side edges, respectively. Front and rear end regions of the end flaps are fixed to the pants-member in the vicinity of the waist line. The side flaps are elastically stretchable in the longitudinal direction and form a pair of pockets opening inwardly of the pad member. Such disposable pants are described to ensure that the pad member comes in close contact with the wearer&apos;s skin between groins of the wearer&apos;s thighs as the pants-member is put on the wearer&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The body fluid absorbent pads such as the pad itself disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application No. 1995-112003A and the pad member disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application No. 1995-155344A commonly intend to ensure that the pad comes in close contact with the wearer&apos;s skin between the groins of the thighs. To achieve this, a width of the pad in the crotch region, in other words, surface area as well as volume available for absorption of body fluid should be inevitably limited and it may be often difficult for the pad to absorb body fluids rapidly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide a disposable body fluid absorbent wearing article improved so that body fluids can be rapidly absorbed although the width of the body fluid absorbent pad in the crotch region is dimensioned to be relatively narrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, there is provided a disposable body fluid absorbent wearing article having a front waist region, a rear waist region and a crotch region, comprising a body fluid absorbent pad including a liquid-absorbent core, a casing covering at least a body facing side of the absorbent core and extending outwardly from a circumferencial edge of the core, and a means to retain the body fluid absorbent pad on a wearer&apos;s body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The pad is further formed in its transversely opposite sides in the crotch region with a pair of darts, by folding parts of the casing, in a manner that the pair of darts are opposed to each other and in a shape of circular arcs which are convex toward a center line bisecting a width of the pad. The pad comprises a central core section lying between the pair of darts and lateral core sections lying outside the respective darts so that the central and lateral core sections are contiguous to each other at least one of regions beyond forward and rearward the pair of darts in longitudinal direction of the pad. The core has its outer peripheral edge surrounded by end flaps and side flaps both being contiguous to the casing and extending outward beyond the outer peripheral edge of the core. The side flaps extending outward beyond transversely opposite side edges of the core are folded back toward a body facing surface of the pad and longitudinally opposite end regions of respective side flaps are fixed to the body facing surface so that pockets opening inwardly of the pad are formed between respective the side flaps and respective lateral core sections. The side flaps folded back toward the body facing surface of the pad respectively have body facing side edge regions provided in parallel to the center line with elastic members secured under tension to these inner side edge regions.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Details of a disposable wearing article will be more fully understood from the description of a disposable diaper as one embodiment of this invention given hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A disposable diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in a perspective view as partially cutaway basically comprises a cover or chassis <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of pants-type and a body fluid absorbent pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> attached to the inner side of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a front waist region <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a rear waist region <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and a crotch region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> respectively have transversely opposite side edge regions joined together along welded zones so as to define a waist-hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a pair of leg-holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed of a laminated sheet composed of a liquid-impervious plastic film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Elastic members <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> respectively extend along peripheral edge regions of the waist-hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the leg-holes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a circumferential direction and are secured under tension to the inner surface of the film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and/or the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extends along the inner surface of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> across the crotch region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to waist-opening peripheral edge regions of the front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a partially cutaway plan view showing the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as pulled to opposite directions shown by arrows <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to separate the front and rear waist regions of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> along the welded zones <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is hourglass-shaped and transversely opposite side edge regions in the crotch region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> curve inwardly in a shape of circular arcs. Longitudinal center line of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extending between the waist-hole peripheral edge regions of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> lies on a center line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> bisecting a width of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> facing the wearer&apos;s body, a liquid-impervious backsheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> facing the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a liquid-absorbent core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> disposed between these sheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The topsheet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the backsheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> respectively form parts of a casing for covering the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and a crotch region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Between the waist-hole peripheral edge regions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, dimensions of these regions <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are substantially in conformity with those of the corresponding regions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extend outwardly beyond an outer peripheral edge of the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and are water-tightly joined together in these extensions to form longitudinally opposite end flaps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and transversely opposite side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> around the outer peripheral edge of the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The longitudinally opposite end flaps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are joined to the inner surfaces of the respective waist-hole peripheral edge regions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of adhesive <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are folded back toward the inner surface of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Longitudinally opposite end regions <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are joined to the inner surface of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of hot melt adhesive <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and intermediate regions of the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> defined between the end regions <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> thereof are not joined to the inner surface of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Inner side edge regions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the respective side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are folded back to form tubular spaces extending in parallel to the center line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and elastic members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending also in parallel to the center line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are secured under tension to the inner surfaces of the respective tubular spaces (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). In the crotch region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed with a pair of darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> transversely opposite to each other about the center line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> so that these darts curve toward the center line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in a shape of circular arcs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> also is substantially hourglass-shaped and, in the crotch region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, divided into a central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> lying between the pair of darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and a pair of lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> lying outside the respective darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. These central and lateral core sections <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> extend forward and rearward beyond longitudinally opposite ends of the respective darts so that the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has its width gradually enlarged toward the rear waist region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> until the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is joined with the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in a rearward region near the rear waist region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> while the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is separated from the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in a front region near the front waist region <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view taken along the center line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As shown, the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises the film <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the nonwoven fabric <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> intermittently bonded to each other by a means of adhesive or welding (both not shown). In the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the topsheet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the backsheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which extend outwardly beyond the longitudinally opposite ends of the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, form the front and rear end flaps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is joined to the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> not only at the end flaps <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by means of adhesive <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> but also at locations on the center line and other appropriate locations thereof by a means of adhesive <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are cross-sectional views taken along lines IV-IV, V-V and VI-VI, respectively, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The line V-V corresponds to a center line bisecting the longitudinal length of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extend beyond the peripheral edge of the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and are overlaid and bonded to each other. The backsheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> further extends outwardly beyond the topsheet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to form a major part of the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. These side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are folded back inwardly of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to extend above the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and thereby to form a pair of pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> directed inward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in the respective darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> formed on the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the lower surfaces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> covering the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> lying between the pair of darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and the lower surfaces <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> covering the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> lying outside the region of the darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, are respectively overlaid with the lower surfaces facing each other and joined together by means of adhesive or welding. In the crotch region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> constituting the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are separated each other in the transverse direction of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with the respective darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> therebetween (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> covering the respective lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> extend outwardly beyond the side edges of these lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> comprising a portion of the side edges of the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and joined together. The backsheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> further extends outwardly beyond the side edges so as to constitute a major part of the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In the crotch region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of such pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, side edge regions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> including the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> tend to hang down obliquely from the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with the darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> composed of the overlaid sheets and functioning as hinge joints, if the core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is in a horizontal state as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, are folded back in the vicinity of outermost side edges of the respective lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> so as to extend obliquely upward and the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> also extend obliquely upward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> functioning in this manner may be obtained by, in the crotch region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, drawing the contour of the transversely opposite side regions of the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> toward the center line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in a shape of circular arcs as is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and joined the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> along these circular arcs as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in a shape of circular arcs have respectively apices <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> adjacent to the center line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the inner side edge regions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the respective side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are positioned above the respective darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the apices <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> thereof so that the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be formed between the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, respectively. The pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is formed with the darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and consequently lines <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> along which the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are folded back in a shape of circular arcs which are convex inwardly of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Formation of the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will be apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> also. It should be understood that the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is narrower in the front waist region <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> than that in the rear waist region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and does not extend to the bottom of the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. While it is possible to dimension the width of the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the front waist region <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to be as large as in the rear waist region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the width of the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the front waist region <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be dimensioned to be relatively narrow in order to prevent the front waist region <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from becoming bulky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the wearing article diagram schematically illustrating a state in which the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has been worn and the crotch region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comes in contact with the wearer&apos;s skin. The central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> lying between the darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is placed against a region <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> defined between the wearer&apos;s groins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> indicated by an imaginary line. The darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> extend toward the groins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and it will be apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> that the darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> function as the hinge joints about which the side regions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> including the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> hang down obliquely along inner sides of the respective groins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> deforms itself in a curve along the wearer&apos;s body in a U-shape about the crotch region <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> upward toward the front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and thereupon contraction of the elastic members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> associated with the respective side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> causes the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to uprise on the surface of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this way, the inner side edge regions <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are placed against the vicinity of the groins <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> from below. Thus the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having the openings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are formed between the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is so dimensioned to be neatly positioned in the space defined between the groins of the thighs <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, in this sate of the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, without formation of many wrinkles. However, even if body fluids discharged on the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can not be rapidly absorbed by the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> alone, the excessive quantity of the body fluids flows sideways as indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> into the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and therefore it is not apprehended that such excessive quantity of body fluids might leak out from the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The excessive quantity of body fluids is absorbed also by the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> so that a limited absorbing capacity of the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be sufficiently compensated. As is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are contiguous to the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the rearward regions near the rear waist region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Even if a relatively large quantity of body fluids flows into the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and saturates the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> with the fluids, the excessive quantity of body fluids permeates from the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to the region near the rear waist region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> formulated to be relatively wide in dimension to absorb more quantity of the body fluids in the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In this way, the quantity of body fluids which would be received by the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be decreased and thereby the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> can maintain the absorbing capacity of the body fluids for a longer period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is divided in the crotch region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, so the side regions <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> including the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are easily bent along the darts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and brought in close contact with the thighs. In addition, the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is separated from the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> also in the front region near the front waist region <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> so that the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> does not obstruct movement of the diaper wearer&apos;s legs. Without departing from the scope of this invention, it is possible to arrange the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> vice versa with respect to the illustrated embodiment so that the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is contiguous to the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in the front region near the front waist region <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and separated from the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in the rearward region near the rear waist region <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. It is also possible to arrange the core <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> so that the central core section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is contiguous to the lateral core sections <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in the regions near the front and rear waist regions <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a view similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> but partially showing another embodiment of this invention. According to this embodiment of this diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, in the vicinity of the center line V-V (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) bisecting the longitudinal dimension of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the inner surface of each side flap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is joined in a region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the topsheet <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> covering each lateral core section <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> by means of adhesive <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and this flap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is substantially upright above the region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. If the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is in the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is an anxiety that, depending on how the diaper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is worn, the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the regions lower than the respective elastic members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> might be slackened to reduce an inner volume of the respective pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the slackened side flaps might prevent the body fluids from smoothly flowing into the pockets <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Such anxiety can be reliably avoided by the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> adapted to rise substantially upright between the elastic members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the regions <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, the means to retain the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> against the wearer&apos;s body is not limited to the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of pants-type used in the illustrated embodiment. For example, waist belt may be used as a retaining means and front and rear end regions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may be attached to this belt. In the case of pants-type cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is also possible to form the entire pants either by a liquid-pervious sheet or by a liquid-impervious sheet. While the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment have proximal end regions <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) formed by the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the remaining regions formed by the backsheet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> alone, it is also possible to form the side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by a sheet prepared separately of the top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and bonded to any one of these top- and backsheets <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. These side flaps <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are preferably liquid-impervious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The disposable body fluid absorbent wearing article according to this invention is characterized in the arrangement such that the parts of the liquid-absorbent core lying outside the darts formed on both side regions of the body fluid absorbent pad hang down so as to extend along the wearer&apos;s legs and these parts cooperate with the side flaps to form the pockets opening inwardly of the pad. This unique arrangement enables body fluids to be rapidly absorbed by the core although the core is dimensioned to be relatively narrow in the crotch region so that the core can be brought in close contact with the wearer&apos;s skin between the groins of the thighs without formation of many wrinkles. The core comprises the central core section lying between the darts and the lateral core sections lying outside the respective darts which are continuous to each other in the region beyond forward or rearward the darts. Such unique arrangement allows the quantity of body fluids by the lateral core sections lying outside the respective darts to spread to the relatively wide central core section. In this way, the lateral core sections can maintain an absorbing capacity of the body fluids for a longer period of time. </paragraph>
