<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to polymer polyol compositions for producing polyurethane resins, methods for producing the polymer polyol compositions, and a method for producing polyurethane resins or foams thereof using the obtained polymer polyols. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Polymer compositions or mixtures obtained by polymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated compound in a polyol are generally referred to as polymer polyols, and are used widely as the materials of polyurethane resins such as polyurethane foams or polyurethane elastomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is known that the content of polymer particles in a polymer polyol may be increased to produce a polymer polyol that provides a high quality polyurethane with a greater hardness and a higher elastic modulus. Known methods to obtain such a polymer polyol include a method of polymerizing a vinyl monomer in the presence of a modified polyol, a portion of which has been allowed to react with a coupling agent (a silicon-containing compound, tetrakisalkoxy orthoformate, trialkoxyalkane, dialkoxyalkane, or the like) to increase its molecular weight (e.g. WO 85/04891), a method of polymerizing a vinyl monomer in the presence of a macromer containing an urethane bond (e.g. JP 61(1986)-115919 A), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, the polymer polyol compositions obtained by the above methods have deficiencies such as poor dispersion stability or deteriorated miscibility with an isocyanate when forming a polyurethane resin, and there were difficulties in handling. Thus, it has been difficult to obtain a polymer polyol composition having good dispersion stability even when the content of polymer particles is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present invention have made earnest investigations to solve the above problems, and found that a polymer polyol composition that provides a high quality polyurethane and has a low viscosity can be obtained by having a content of oligomers of not more than a specified amount, thus reaching the present invention. Furthermore, it was also found that the same polymer polyol composition can be obtained by mechanically dispersing or crushing a polymer polyol obtained by polymerizing a monomer in the presence of a specific dispersant, thus reaching the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the inventors found that the use of a specific compound having an ethylenically-unsaturated group at a terminal (hereinafter referred to as terminal ethylenically-unsaturated group containing compound) and/or a specific reactive dispersant allows the same polymer polyol composition to be obtained, thus providing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide polymer polyols having a low viscosity and very good dispersion stability even when the concentration of the polymer particles is high, and to provide methods for producing the polymer polyols. Also, it is another object of the present invention to provide a method for producing polyurethane resins using these polymer polyol compositions or foams thereof, wherein the polyurethane resins or foams thereof have good operation efficiency and have high 25% ILD (hardness) and small compression set. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the first invention of the present invention, the content of the polymer particles (B) dispersed in (A) in the polymer polyol composition (I) is usually from 35 to 75 mass %, preferably from 45 to 75 mass %. If the content of (B) is not less than 35 mass %, a polyurethane foam having a sufficient compressive hardness can be obtained. Furthermore, if the content of (B) is not more than 75 mass %, the polymer particles do not aggregate and settle, so that handling becomes easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the first invention, it is necessary that the amount of the soluble polymers (P) dissolved in the polyol (A) in (I) is not more than 5 mass %, preferably not more than 3 mass %, based on the mass of (A). If the amount of (P) exceeds 5 mass %, the viscosity of the polymer polyol composition increases. As a result, handling becomes difficult, and a polyurethane foam with a low hardness is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The soluble polymers (P) dissolved in the polyol (A) herein refer to the soluble polymers obtained by removing the polymer particles (B) insoluble in (A) as well as (A) (containing small amounts of by-products of low molecular weight) from the polymer polyol composition (I), and they are usually compounds having a higher molecular weight than the polyol (A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The amount of the soluble polymers (P) is measured as follows. 20 g of methanol is added to 5 g of (I) and put in a stainless tube of 100 cc. The polymer particles (B) are allowed to aggregate by a centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 60 minutes at a temperature of 20&deg; C. to obtain a transparent supernatant. From this solution, methanol is removed by a pressure-reducing dryer, and then the polyol (A) (containing small amounts of by-products of low molecular weight) and the polymers (P) soluble in (A) &lsqb;(P) has a molecular weight of at least 4000; in chromatography, the peak of (P) usually appears on the side of a higher molecular weight than the peak of (A)&rsqb; are sampled by preparative liquid chromatography. The amount of (P) is determined from the mass ratio of the sampled (A) and (P). The soluble polymers (P) usually have a weight-average molecular weight (measured by gel permeation chromatography; hereinafter abbreviated as GPC) of 6000 to 30000, however, they may include those having a higher molecular weight.

<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&lsqb;Solubility Parameter&rsqb;&equals;(&Dgr;<highlight><italic>E/V</italic></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In the above equation, &Dgr;E indicates a cohesive energy density, and V indicates a molecular volume. The value of V is determined by the calculation of Robert F. Fedoors et al., which is described, for example, in <highlight><italic>Polymer Engineering and Science</italic></highlight>, Volume 14, pages 147 to 154. It is described that the solubility parameters of typical resins are, for example, as follows: as the values of vinyl-based polymers, polystyrene&equals;10.6, polyacrylonitrile&equals;14.4, poly(methyl methacrylate)&equals;9.9; as the values of polyethers, polyethylene glycol&equals;9.4, polypropylene glycol&equals;8.7; as the values of polyolefins, polyethylene&equals;8.6, polypropylene&equals;8.0; as the values of polyesters, poly(ethylene terephthalate)&equals;12.4, poly(butylene terephthalate)&equals;11.7; and as the values of polyamides, 6-nylon&equals;11.9, 6,6-nylon&equals;11.9. The values of other resins also can be calculated by combining the values of respective chemical bonds shown in the table. For example, the value of polyimide is calculated from the values of pyromellitic acid and 1,4-diaminobenzene to be 19.6, and the value of polyurethane is calculated from 1,4-butanediol and diphenylmethanediisocyanate to be 12.3. However, the real values may be more or less different from these calculated values, due to a small difference in the structure or the structures at the terminals of the resins. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the polymerization of (b) can be carried out by, for instance, radical polymerization, coordinated anionic polymerization, metathesis polymerization, Diels-Alder polymerization, and the like. Preferably, radical polymerization is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Polymerization of the radically polymerizable compound can be carried out in the same way as the polymerization of conventional polymer polyols. For example, the method of polymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated compound (b) in a polyol (A) containing a dispersant (D) in the presence of a polymerization initiator (the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,383,351, etc.) may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the polymerization can be carried out either in batch or continuous systems under atmospheric pressure or increased pressure, or under reduced pressure. A diluent (C) and a chain transfer agent can be used as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> As the radical polymerization initiator, compounds that form a free radical to initiate polymerization may be used. Examples of the compounds include azo compounds, such as 2,2&prime;-azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2&prime;-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), 2,2&prime;-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile), 1,1&prime;-azobis(cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile), 2,2&prime;-azobis(2,4,4-trimethylpentane), dimethyl-2,2&prime;-azobis(2-methyl propionate), 2,2&prime;-azobis&lsqb;2-(hydroxymethyl)propionitrile&rsqb; and 1,1&prime;-azobis(1-acetoxy-1-phenylethane); organic peroxides such as dibenzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, bis(4-t-butylcyclohexyl) peroxidicarbonate, benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide and persuccinic acid; and inorganic peroxides, such as persulfate and perborate.

When the amount of the polymerization initiator used is from 0.05 to 20 mass %, the polymerization degree of (b) in the polymer polyol is sufficiently high, and also the molecular weight is high. Thus, it is excellent in that a polyurethane foam having a sufficient compressive hardness can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Examples of the diluent (C) used in the radical polymerization include: aromatic hydrocarbon-based solvents such as toluene and xylene; saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon-based solvents having 5 to 15 carbon atoms such as hexane and heptane; unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon-based solvents having 5 to 30 carbon atoms such as octene, nonene, and decene; ether-based solvents such as dioxane; ester-based solvents such as ethyl acetate; nitrile-based solvents such as acetonitrile; and amide-based solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide and N, N-dimethylacetoamide. Preferred as (C) are aromatic hydrocarbon-based solvents since the obtained polymer polyol compositions have lower viscosities. More preferred is xylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The amount of (C) used is preferably from 0 to 50 mass %, more preferably from 1 to 40 mass %, based on the amount of (b) used. </paragraph>

In the coordinated anionic polymerization, an initiator composed of an organic alkyl compound of the metals of I, II and III groups in the periodic table in combination with a salt of the metals of IV to VII groups can be used. Furthermore, in the metathesis polymerization, an initiator composed of WCl<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>or MoCl<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>in combination with an organic aluminum can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In the method (ii) &lsqb;Sixth Invention&rsqb; to obtain the polymer polyol composition (I) comprising separating the polymer particles (B) from a polymer polyol composition obtained by polymerizing (b) in a polyol and mechanically dispersing the polymer particles (B) in (A) not containing soluble polymers, the polymer particles (B) are vinyl polymer particles or polymer particles obtained by polycondensation or polyaddition reaction, and usually have a particle size of 0.1 to 50 m. The fine polymer particles separated from a conventional polymer polyol obtained by polymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated compound (b) in a polyol in the presence of a polymerization initiator to form a polymer polyol, adding a solvent to the polymer polyol as needed, and allowing them to settle by centrifuging are used as the polymer particles (B). Furthermore, fine polymer particles produced by emulsion polymerization or suspension polymerization, which are known as methods for producing polymer particles, also can be employed. As the polymer particles (B), it is preferable to use the particles obtained by polymerizing (b) in a polyol (A), because of the easiness of the method steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> In the method (ii) &lsqb;Sixth Invention&rsqb;, examples of the solvent used as needed include those mentioned as the diluent (C). As the device for mechanically redispersing in the polyol (A) the polymer obtained by adding a solvent to a polymer polyol as needed after polymerization and subjecting it to centrifugation, any device capable of dispersing or crushing using the principle of impact, shock or shear can be employed regardless of the mechanism, structure, and material thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> One example of the dispersing or crushing machine used in the present invention is a dispersing machine that tears and disperses a liquid by applying pressure and thereby makes it collide against a metal wall (valve) (homogenizer, manufactured by A. P. V. GAURIN, Ltd.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> The fourth invention of the present invention is a polymer polyol composition (III) comprising a polyol (A) and polymer particles (B) dispersed in (A) or a dispersion medium composed of (A) and a diluent (C), the polymer particles (B) being formed by polymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated compound (b) in a dispersion medium comprising (A) in the presence of a dispersant (D&prime;) to form polymer particles, and mechanically dispersing or crushing the polymer particles, in which the difference between the solubility parameter SPd of (D&prime;) and the solubility parameter SPa of (A) is not more than 0.8. The seventh invention is a method for producing the polymer polyol composition (III). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> In the fourth invention, the polyol (A) may be used as a dispersion medium, either alone or in combination with the aforementioned diluent (C). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The content of (C) in the dispersion medium may be arbitrary. However, it is usually from 0 to 80 mass %, preferably from 1 to 50 mass %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> As the dispersant (D&prime;) used in the fourth invention, it is necessary to choose a dispersant in which the difference between the solubility parameter SPd of the dispersant and the solubility parameter SPa of the polyol is usually not more than 0.8, preferably not more than 0.6, in absolute value. By letting the difference be not more than 0.8 in absolute value, the dispersion stability of the polymer polyol is improved, and aggregation and sedimentation of the polymer particles can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> The solubility parameter herein refers to that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> As one example of the dispersant (D&prime;) of the present invention, the same as those described above for the dispersant (D) may be used, as long as the condition of the SP value is satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> As one example of the dispersant (D&prime;), a compound obtained by reacting polypropylene glycol with glycidyl methacrylate has a solubility parameter SPd of 8.8. This is different from the value of SPa by 0.1 when the polyether (A) is polypropylene glycol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In the fourth invention, as the ethylenically unsaturated compound (b), known compounds having one or more polymerizable vinyl group and used in the production of polymer polyols can be employed. Specifically, the above described (b2-1), (b2-2), (b2-3) and (b2-4), and mixtures of two or more thereof may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Among these, (b2-1) and (b2-2) are preferred, and styrene and/or acrylonitrile are more preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> The mass ratios thereof these with respect to the total amount of (b) can be changed depending on the required properties of the polyurethane, etc., and are not particularly limited. However, one example is as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> (b2-1): usually from 0 to 100 mass %, preferably from 20 to 80 mass % </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> (b2-2): usually from 0 to 95 mass %, preferably from 20 to 80 mass % </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> (b2-3): usually from 0 to 50 mass %, preferably from 0 to 20 mass % </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> (b2-4): usually from 0 to 10 mass %, preferably from 0 to 5 mass % </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> By using the above-mentioned polyfunctional vinyl-containing monomers (b2-5) having two or more functional groups (preferably from 2 to 8 functional groups) at least in a portion of (b) (preferably from 0.05 to 1 mass %), the strength of the polymer can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> The polymer polyol of the fourth invention is characterized in that it has a low viscosity even when the content of the polymer particles in the polymer polyol is high. The content of the polymer particles is usually from 30 to 75 mass %, preferably from 40 to 70 mass %, more preferably from 45 to 60 mass %. When the content of the polymer particles is at least 30 mass %, a polyurethane foam having a sufficient compressive hardness can be obtained, and this is preferred. Furthermore, by letting the content of the polymer particles be not more than 75 mass %, aggregation and sedimentation of the polymer particles can be prevented, and the polymer polyol can exhibit good handling properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> In the fourth invention, the polymerization of the polymer polyol can be carried out in the presence of a dispersant (D&prime;) in the same manner as the above polymerization method described for a conventional polymer polyol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> In the fourth invention, as the polymerization initiator used in the polymerization of the polymer polyol, the radical polymerization initiator described above for the first and second inventions, etc. can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The amount of the radical polymerization initiator used is usually from 0.05 to 10 mass %, preferably from 0.1 to 5 mass %, more preferably from 0.2 to 2.5 mass %, based on the mass of the ethylenically unsaturated compound (b). By letting the amount of the polymerization initiator used be at least 0.05 mass %, a decrease in the polymerization degree of (b) can be prevented, and the content of the polymer particles formed from (b) in the polymer polyol can be sufficiently high. Furthermore, by letting the amount of the polymerization initiator used be not more than 10 mass %, a decrease in the molecular weight of the polymer particles can be prevented, and a polyurethane foam having a sufficient compressive hardness can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if necessary, the polymerization can be carried out in the presence of the aforementioned chain transfer agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> In the fourth invention, the polymer polyol (III) can be obtained by physically and mechanically dispersing or crushing the polymer particles dispersed in the polymer polyol obtained by polymerization. In this case, the polymer particles (B) are not separated temporally from a polymer polyol. But the polymer particles (B) are retained in a polymer polyol, and are dispersed further mechanically. For example, the polymer polyol may be dispersed further by (i) forwarding it from a polymerization reaction vessel to a dispersing or crushing machine; or by (ii) forwarding it from a polymerization vessel to a reservoir and storing it temporarily, and then forwarding it to a dispersing or crushing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> The mechanism of the dispersing or crushing is, for example, to utilize impact or shock, or shear. With the ability of dispersing or crushing by utilizing these principles, any device can be used regardless of its mechanism, structure and material. One example of the dispersing or crushing machine used in the present invention is a dispersing machine that tears and disperses a liquid by applying pressure to the liquid and make it collide against a valve (homogenizer; manufactured by A. P. V. GAURIN, Ltd.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> The polymer particles (B) in the polymer polyol after polymerization usually have a particle size of not more than 3 &mgr;m, preferably not more than 2 &mgr;m. The polymer polyol containing these polymer particles is put in a dispersing or crushing machine, and dispersed or crushed forcefully, so that the size of the polymer particles (B) is reduced. Thus, the polymer polyol (III) is obtained. The particle size of the polymer particles after dispersing or crushing is usually not more than 1 &mgr;m, preferably not more than 0.5 &mgr;m. &lsqb;The particle size is measured by a light scattering particle size distribution meter LA-700 (manufactured by HORIBA, Ltd.).&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> The temperature after dispersing or crushing is in the range of 0&deg; C. to 100&deg; C., preferably 5&deg; C. to 50&deg; C. Furthermore, when the polymer particles (B) in the polymer polyol are mechanically dispersed or crushed, the polymer polyol may be diluted with a solvent, if necessary. As the solvent, those exemplified above for (C) can be employed. The mechanical dispersing or crushing of the polymer polyol is usually carried out from 1 to 20 times, preferably from 2 to 10 times. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure after dispersing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> The removal of the solvent is carried out under atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure (e.g. reduction degree of 20 to 30 mmHg) at a temperature of 60 to 100&deg; C.

However, it is usually from 500 to 20,000 mPa&middot;s (25&deg; C.), preferably from 700 to 15,000 mPa&middot;s (25&deg; C.). By letting the viscosity of the polymer polyol (III) be not more than 20,000 mPa&middot;s (25&deg; C.), the polymer polyol can exhibit good handling properties. Furthermore, by letting the viscosity of the polymer polyol (III) be at least 500 mPa&middot;s (25&deg; C.), a polyurethane foam having a more sufficient compressive hardness can be obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> Usually, as the properties of polyurethane foams, a density in the range of 15 to 50 kg/m<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>is preferable, and larger values of 25% ILD, tensile strength, tear strength, elongation, resilience and air flow are preferable. Furthermore, a smaller value of compression set is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> As seen from Tables 1 to 3, the polymer polyols (F-1 to F-8, F-10, F-11, and F-21 to F29) of Examples 1 to 10 and 21 to 29 have lower viscosities than the polymer polyol (F-9) of Comparative Example 1, and have more excellent properties, particularly in 25% ILD (hardness), air flow and compression set. Moreover, the polyurethane foams produced from the polymer polyols (F-1 to F-8, F-10 and 11) have the same or higher tensile strength, tear strength, elongation, and resilience as those produced from the polymer polyol (F-9). Furthermore, because the polymer polyols (F-12, F-13) of Comparative Examples 2 and 3 have lower concentrations of polymer particles than the polymer polyols (F-I to F-8, F-10, F-11, and F-21 to F-29) of Examples 1 to 10 and 21 to 29and the comparative polymer polyol (F-9) of Comparative Example 1, they have low viscosities. However, the properties of the polyurethane foams produced from the polymer polyols (F-12, F-13) are significantly inferior to the properties of the polyurethane foams produced from the polymer polyols (F-1 to F-8, F-10 and 11), particularly in 25% ILD (hardness). In general, as the concentration of polymer particles increases, the tensile strength, elongation, resilience and air flow decrease, and the compression set increases. However, the polyurethane foams using the polymer polyols of the present invention &lsqb;Examples (1), (5) to (10), and (21) to (29)&rsqb; exhibit the same or greater properties than the polyurethane foam of Comparative Example 1 having the same concentration of polymer particles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> According to the polymer polyols of the present invention and the methods for producing the same, polymer polyols having low viscosities and exceptionally good dispersion stability can be obtained, even when the polymer polyols have a higher concentration of polymer particles than conventional polymer polyols. Thus, the operation efficiency can be improved significantly in the production of polyurethane resins, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the polyurethane resins produced using the polymer polyols of the present invention as an essential component of a polyol exhibit much more excellent 25% ILD (hardness) than those produced using conventional polymer polyols, when they have the same viscosity. Furthermore, the polyurethane resins produced using the polymer polyols of the present invention have considerably better 25% ILD, air flow and compression set than those produced using conventional polymer polyols, when the concentrations of polymer particles the polymer polyols are the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> Because of the above-mentioned effects, the polyurethane resins produced using the polymer polyols of the present invention are exceptionally suitable as polyurethane foams for the uses such as interior parts of automobiles, furniture, and the like. </paragraph>
