<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to optical waveguides and more particularly, to the use of isotopes in low loss optical waveguides. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Optical waveguides, and in particular optical fibers, have revolutionized the global telecommunications industry by dramatically increasing the &ldquo;bandwidth&rdquo; of communication channels (i.e., the amount of data that can be transferred along a communication channel in a given time period). However, as rapidly as optical transmission technologies have progressed, the demand for greater bandwidth, particularly in the context of the internet, has expanded even more rapidly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The bandwidth of a communication channel is determined by the product of two terms&mdash;the speed of signal transfer along that channel and the signal capacity of that channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The speed of signal transfer or carrier speed along an optical communication channel depends on a number of factors that include signal dispersion and signal attenuation or loss. Signal dispersion relates to the gradual &ldquo;spreading&rdquo; of signals that occurs as different angular modes of a signal travel along an optical waveguide at different speeds. Signal attenuation relates to the inherent losses that occur as a signal progresses along an optical waveguide. For long distance point-to-point communication systems, the dispersion and attenuation of a signal determines the maximum possible span between regenerative repeaters (devices that correct the dispersion and amplify the signal). The latest generation optical waveguides exhibit attenuation levels that are on the order of 0.2-0.5 dB/km and require amplification every few hundred kilometers. As signals pass through these regenerative repeaters, they incur a delay that slows down their overall progress and hence decreases the carrier speed of that communication channel. As a consequence, the development of optical waveguides with even lower attenuation levels than current low loss waveguides, would dramatically increase the carrier speed of communication systems, and in particular long distance communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are two main approaches to increasing the capacity of individual communication channels, namely time-division multiplexing (TDM) and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Both involve the combination of multiple signals in a single communication channel (i.e., multiplexing). By interleaving the pulses of different signals, and thereby sharing a channel on a time basis, TDM systems take advantage of the fact that data input into optical communication systems is often slower than the peak signal carrier speed of optical channels. By transmitting signals of different wavelength in parallel, and thereby sharing a channel on a wavelength basis, WDM systems take advantage of the fact that optical waveguides can simultaneously transmit signals over a range of non overlapping wavelengths. Signal attenuation in optical waveguides is strongly wavelength dependent, and therefore the &ldquo;WDM&rdquo; capacity of an optical waveguide is determined in part by the range of low loss wavelengths of that particular waveguide. As a consequence, the development of optical waveguides with low attenuation levels over a wider range of optical wavelengths than in current broadband optical waveguides, would dramatically increase the channel capacity of WDM communication systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Since Corning Glass Company patented the first truly low loss optical fiber fabrication process in the 1970&apos;s (U.S. Pat. No. 3,932,162) numerous patents and papers have presented designs for new optical waveguides. Many of these are designed for lower loss, and others are designed for dispersion control and compensation. Still others are designed for suitable amplification and/or nonlinear optical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, there still remains a demand in the art, for communication channels of ever increasing bandwidth, and hence, a need for the development of optical waveguides with lower dispersion, lower loss and/or higher capacity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an isotopic optical waveguide. In particular, the invention provides an isotopic optical waveguide that has high carrier speed and high channel capacity as a consequence of having low attenuation over a wide range of optical wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Optical waveguides are optically transparent devices, sometimes made of plastic but most often of silica, through which light can be transmitted by a series of total internal reflections. Optical waveguides such as optical fibers may, for example, comprise a core region (in which the light is guided) and a cladding region surrounding the core region in a substantially cylindrical geometry. For total internal reflection to occur at the core/cladding interface, the refractive index of the core region must exceed that of the cladding region (i.e., light must travel more slowly in the core than in the cladding). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Current low loss silica optical waveguides of core/cladding design employ a pure silica cladding and a silica core that has been doped with a small amount of germania (i.e., GeO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The substitution of germania for silica in the core region raises the refractive index of the core above that of the cladding by a small controllable amount. However, as is known in the art and as will be discussed below, the presence of impurities such as germania in the core guiding region of an optical waveguide also increases the light loss of that optical waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention involves the recognition that low loss optical waveguides based on a core/cladding design can be constructed by using different concentrations of silicon and/or oxygen isotopes in the core and cladding regions of an all-silica optical waveguide. Additionally, the present invention provides the first example of an optical waveguide which exhibits low loss across the 1.6 to 1.7 &mgr;m optical wavelength range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention involves the recognition that the use of different concentrations of silicon and/or oxygen isotopes in the core and cladding regions of a germania doped silica optical waveguide, reduces the level of germania dopant that is required in the core to obtain a given refractive index difference between the core and cladding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Below, we discuss certain embodiments of the isotopic composition of the optical waveguide of the present invention, and the ways in which certain properties of the optical waveguide of the present invention, such as carrier speed and channel capacity, are affected by isotopic composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In order that certain aspects and advantages of the present invention will be more readily appreciated, we begin with a discussion of the properties of optical waveguides of a core/cladding design, with particular reference to the effects of isotopic composition on signal attenuation and refractive index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Signal attenuation is a measure of the decay of signal strength, or loss of light power that occurs as signals in the form of light pulses propagate through the length of an optical waveguide. The amount of attenuation caused by an optical waveguide is primarily determined by its length and the wavelength of the light traveling through the waveguide. There are three major contributions to the dependence of attenuation on wavelength in optical waveguides. The first of these contributions, is absorption and scattering from extrinsic components (e.g., impurities) of the waveguide material. For example, in silica a near infrared absorption occurs at optical wavelengths of about 1.25 and 1.4 &mgr;m and is due to hydroxide ions (OH<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) trapped in the fiber during the fabrication process. Great progress has been made in recent years to reduce this contribution. The second of these contributions is Rayleigh scattering from the intrinsic ultraviolet absorption edge. This absorption edge is due to electronic transitions and in optical waveguides made of silica, is dominated by the native SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>absorption that increases dramatically below optical wavelengths of 1 &mgr;m. GeO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, when added as a dopant to the silica core of an optical waveguide, will also contribute a small amount to this ultraviolet absorption. The third of these contributions, is an infrared absorption tail from optical phonons of the material. Since SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is a slightly polar material, in silica, mid infrared optical photons can excite vibrational states of the Si&mdash;O bonds. The largest energy phonon in conventional (i.e., natural abundance) fused silica (denoted &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>) corresponds to a photon of wavelength 9.89 &mgr;m and the infrared absorption therefore decreases rapidly for photon wavelengths that are shorter than 9.89 &mgr;m. This decrease in absorption is however exponential in nature: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> where &agr;<highlight><subscript>IR </subscript></highlight>is the loss due to infrared absorption and &lgr; is the optical wavelength. As a consequence, losses due to infrared absorption extend into optical wavelengths of about 1.7 &mgr;m that are in the near-infrared region of the optical spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The overall loss in a silica material (denoted &agr;) is therefore given by the sum of losses due to extrinsic infrared absorption (&agr;<highlight><subscript>OH&minus;</subscript></highlight>), intrinsic ultraviolet electronic Rayleigh scattering (&agr;<highlight><subscript>Rayleigh</subscript></highlight>), and intrinsic bandtailing absorption from the infrared vibrational absorption (&agr;<highlight><subscript>IR</subscript></highlight>): </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As a result of the balance between these ultraviolet and infrared contributions, silica waveguides possess a relatively narrow loss minimum which typically falls in the optical wavelength range of 1.5 to 1.6 &mgr;m. This fact is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which is a schematic diagram of the loss per unit length of a typical modern silica optical waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from Equation 1, &agr;<highlight><subscript>IR </subscript></highlight>shifts with the optical phonon energy &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>of the silica material and as will be described below is therefore affected by the isotopic composition of the silica material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The refractive index of a material is also determined by a similar balance between the infrared and ultraviolet absorptions through the Kramers-Kronig relations. The Kramers-Kronig relations are a consequence of the causal nature of optical interactions, and impose a universal relationship between the linear optical absorption spectrum and the refractive index of a material. An absorption will, in general increase the absorption across the entire optical (visible and infrared) spectrum. Such a resonance will produce a contribution to the refractive index which is positive (i.e., increases the refractive index) for wavelengths longer than the resonance, and which is negative (i.e., decreases the refractive index) for wavelengths that are shorter than the resonance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As a rule, additional short wavelength ultraviolet absorption (i.e., shorter than 1.5 &mgr;m) and additional long wavelength infrared absorption (i.e., longer than 1.6 &mgr;m) will increase and decrease the refractive index within the low loss 1.5 to 1.6 &mgr;m communication window, respectively. Conventional fiber doping with germania increases the refractive index of the core of an optical waveguide of core/cladding design by adding additional ultraviolet absorption to the core region in the form of GeO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>impurities. However, as was mentioned in the previous section, increased ultraviolet absorption in the form of GeO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>also increases signal loss. As a consequence, conventional fiber doping incurs extra loss in the core guiding region of optical waveguides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention involves the recognition that the required difference in refractive index between the core and cladding of an optical waveguide of core/cladding design can be achieved by decreasing the infrared absorption of the core region relative to the infrared absorption of the cladding region. Another aspect of the present invention involves the recognition that low loss optical waveguides based on a core/cladding design can be constructed by decreasing the infrared absorption of the core region instead of increasing the ultraviolet absorption of the core region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It has in the past, been recognized that optical waveguides made of materials heavier than silica (e.g., fluoride materials) would provide a decrease in infrared absorption. Unfortunately, these materials are expensive, difficult to fabricate, and are not chemically compatible with the fused silica used in conventional optical waveguides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It would therefore be of some advantage to identify a core material which is chemically compatible with conventional fused silica and yet has a lower infrared absorption than conventional fused silica. Such a material need not be as inexpensive as conventional fused silica since the core region typically makes up only a small fraction of the optical waveguide. For example, the core of a typical &ldquo;single mode&rdquo; optical fiber (in which the core region is significantly smaller than the cladding region) only represents about 1% of the total material volume. To put it in cost terms, a core material which is five times as costly than conventional fused silica, will increase the cost of the fiber material itself by about 4%, and will increase the total cost of the fully cabled fiber by much less than that. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention involves the recognition that one way of providing a core material with a higher refractive index than the cladding material and which is chemically identical to the cladding material, is to form the core from a mixture of silicon and/or oxygen isotopes in such a way that the infrared absorption of the core material is lower than the infrared absorption of the cladding material which is formed from a different mixture of silicon and/or oxygen isotopes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In order that certain aspects and advantages of the present invention will be more readily appreciated, we continue with a more detailed discussion of the effects of isotopic composition on infrared absorption, and hence on the refractive index of a silica material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The refractive index of a silica material as a function of optical wavelength in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 &mgr;m is well described by the following empirical Sellmeier formula:

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The difference in resonance frequency between two different regions of a silica material containing different isotope pairs will therefore be proportional to the difference in the square root of the reduced mass of each pair. For small differences in reduced mass, this is approximately proportional to one half the change in reduced mass. This is most easily expressed by differentiating Equation 4 and expressing the result as a fractional difference in resonance frequency (or resonance wavelength) as follows:

Thus, a desired refractive index difference &Dgr;n<highlight><subscript>total </subscript></highlight>between two regions of an all-silica material may be achieved by appropriate choice of isotope distributions in these regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An important limitation to optical waveguide fabrication using this method is the maximum refractive index difference which may be achieved between two regions of an all-silica material through the use of isotopic mixtures. For example, if one region of a silica material is 100% enriched for the heavy isotopes of silicon and oxygen, namely <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O (i.e., a reduced mass of about 11.25), and a second region of the material comprises natural abundance silica that is rich in the lighter isotopes of silicon and oxygen, namely <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>O (i.e., a reduced mass of about 10.20), then the fractional increase in reduced mass between the heavier and lighter regions is approximately 10%. By substituting this fractional increase into Equation 6, a 5% fractional increase in the maximum transverse phonon resonance wavelength is obtained between the heavier and lighter regions. As was mentioned earlier, the maximum transverse phonon resonance wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>of natural silica that is rich in <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>O is known to be about 9.89 &mgr;m. The maximum transverse phonon resonance wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>of silica that is 100% enriched for <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O is therefore predicted to be about 10.38 &mgr;m (ie., 5% greater). Substituting these values for &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>into the Sellmeier formula of Equation 3, yields the refractive index for each of the two regions of the material as a function of wavelength. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> which is a schematic diagram of the refractive index as a function of wavelength for the heavier and lighter regions. The difference in refractive index between the two regions of the material varies from about 500 ppm (parts per million) at lower wavelengths to about 1000 ppm at higher wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> While the core region of an optical waveguide will guide light for any refractive index that is greater than that of the cladding region, modem optical waveguide designs generally strive for a refractive index difference between the core and cladding in the range of 100 to 1000 ppm. We therefore find that it is possible, through the use of isotopic mixtures, to introduce a refractive index difference between two regions of an all-silica material which is comparable to that obtained in conventional optical waveguides with a doped core. In addition this is achieved by decreasing the infrared absorption rather than increasing the ultraviolet absorption and hence results in a lower overall loss in the optical waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> While a refractive index of nearly 1000 ppm is sufficient for optical confinement of a waveguide mode, conventional optical waveguides occasionally use somewhat larger refractive index differences (e.g., between about 2000 and 10,000 ppm). In certain embodiments of the present invention, a small amount of germania may therefore be added to the core of an inventive optical waveguide to increase the refractive index difference further, while maintaining the low loss advantage offered by the isotope mixture in the core. It will be appreciated that the amount of germania dopant required will depend on the desired refractive index difference and the refractive index difference already provided by the isotopic mixture in the core. Generally speaking the addition of 1 mole percent of germania dopant increases the refractive index of silica by about 1000 ppm (for a review see, for example, <highlight><italic>Optical Fiber Transmission</italic></highlight>, Ed. by Bert Basch, Howard E. Sams &amp; Co., Indianapolis, 1987, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). Accordingly, while current optical waveguides require the addition of 2 mole percent of germania dopant to achieve a refractive index difference of about 2000 ppm between core and cladding, the current invention enables the same refractive index difference to be achieved with about half as much dopant. More generally, it will be appreciated that the current invention allows doped silica optical waveguides to be prepared that have a refractive index difference between the core and cladding regions that is greater than would be predicted simply on the basis of the mole percent of dopant that has been added to the core region. Fro example, the refractive index difference between the core and cladding regions of an inventive optical waveguide may be at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or at least 95% greater than would be predicted on the basis of the mole percent of dopant that has been added to the core region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The calculations described above (i.e., Equations 1-9) are based on an optical waveguide which consists of two distinct regions, one 100% enriched for <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O and the other 100% enriched for <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>O. It will be appreciated that the isotopic composition of the optical waveguide of the present invention is not limited to such an extreme example, and that a variety of intermediary isotopic compositions can be envisaged. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the dependence of the refractive index difference between two regions of an all-silica material on the reduced mass ratio between the two regions for optical wavelengths of 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 &mgr;m. The refractive index of a given region of the optical waveguide of the present invention will therefore depend on the isotopic composition of that particular region and may lie anywhere between the extreme values depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As was mentioned in the earlier section that discussed signal attenuation in optical waveguides, the overall loss in a silica material is determined by the balance between various intrinsic and extrinsic infrared and ultraviolet absorptions (Equation 2). Of particular interest is the dependence of the losses due to intrinsic infrared absorption (i.e., &agr;<highlight><subscript>IR</subscript></highlight>) on the transverse phonon resonance wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>(Equation 1). As we have just described in the above section on refractive indices, the transverse phonon resonance wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>depends on the isotopic composition of the silica material. As was calculated above, in natural abundance silica, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>equals about 9.89 &mgr;m, while in silica that is 100% enriched for <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O, &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>equals about 10.38 &mgr;m. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the losses in these two silica materials as a function of optical wavelength, and was obtained by inserting the above values of &lgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>into Equation 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> also includes the losses due to ultraviolet Rayleigh scattering (i.e., &agr;<highlight><subscript>Rayleigh</subscript></highlight>) that occur at lower optical wavelengths and remain relatively unaffected by isotope shifts). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The total number of wavelength channels which can be carried by an optical waveguide is determined, in a significant way, by the wavelength range over which the fiber exhibits low loss. The minimum loss requirements for optical waveguides vary with application. For long distance applications, long spans are required and the combination of low loss non-uniformity in the waveguide and gain non-uniformity at amplifier stages together may result in inferior performance for wavelength channels that are close to the edge of the low loss band. Long range terrestrial and undersea links therefore confine themselves to the low loss region between about 1.5 and 1.6 &mgr;m, labeled &ldquo;A&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The use of a mixture of heavy isotopes in the core as described herein results in an extended region of low loss between about 1.6 and 1.7 &mgr;m (labeled &ldquo;B&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), approximately doubling the number of low loss wavelength channels available for optical communications. Thus, the use of isotopic mixtures in the core region of optical waveguides made according to the present invention represents a significant improvement over conventional germania doped silica cores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In its naturally occurring form, silicon is primarily composed of three isotopes in the following abundances, 92.2% <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>Si, 4.7% <highlight><superscript>29</superscript></highlight>Si, and 3.1% <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si. In accordance with the present invention, an isotopically enriched region of <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>Si is a region that contains the isotope <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>Si in a concentration of more than 92.2% of the silicon atoms in that region. Similarly, enriched regions of <highlight><superscript>29</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si are regions that have atomic concentrations of these isotopes that exceed 4.7% and 3.1%, respectively. In its naturally occurring form, oxygen is primarily composed of two isotopes in the following abundances, 99.8% <highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>O and 0.2% <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O. In accordance with the present invention, enriched regions of <highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>O and <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O are regions that have atomic concentrations of these isotopes that exceed 99.8% and 0.2%, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a variety of regions each having a different isotopic composition. It will be appreciated that different regions of the optical waveguide of the present invention may also be enriched for different isotopes of different elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a region substantially enriched for a silicon isotope (e.g., <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si). In another embodiment, the optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a region substantially enriched for an oxygen isotope (e.g., <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O). In yet another embodiment, the optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a region substantially enriched for two different silicon isotopes (e.g., <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>29</superscript></highlight>Si). In still another embodiment, the optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a region substantially enriched for a silicon isotope and an oxygen isotope (e.g., <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O ). In another embodiment, the optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a region substantially enriched for two different silicon isotopes and an oxygen isotope (e.g., <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si, <highlight><superscript>29</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O). In certain embodiments, the optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a region of natural abundance silica. In another embodiment, the optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a region that has been doped with a suitable dopant such as germania, fluorine, erbium, or ytterbium. In one embodiment, the optical waveguide of the present invention may comprise a region that has been enriched for an isotope of silicon and/or oxygen and further doped with a suitable dopant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that the optical waveguide of the present invention may be divided into a variety of regions of substantially different or substantially similar isotopic composition, and is not limited to a simple one core, one cladding design as described in some of the above examples. Indeed, optical waveguide design necessarily includes careful determination of the core and cladding compositions, and refractive index profile in order to optimize properties such as the mode field diameter (important for coupling and compatibility between waveguides) and dispersion (important for optimizing the performance of long distance terrestrial and submarine links). These designs are often accomplished by achieving a continuous variation in refractive index within the core and cladding (i.e., &ldquo;graded index profile&rdquo;), in which a maximum value of refractive index in the core region decreases in a substantially continuous and smooth fashion towards the outer edge of the cladding region. A continuously varying mixture of isotopes within the core and cladding regions will accomplish such an index gradient. Modern approaches to dispersion management in optical waveguide systems often require multiple cladding designs (i.e., &ldquo;multi-step index&rdquo; waveguides) with a refractive index profile that involves a stepwise variation in refractive index within the core and cladding regions of the optical waveguide. The use of isotopes of varying mixtures in different cladding regions will accomplish such an index gradient, and will therefore permit the construction of, for example, dispersion shifted or dispersion flattened waveguides. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Laser Isotope Separation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The laser isotope separation technique relies on the fact that many molecules exhibit vibrational transitions in the near- to mid-infrared range. Bombarding molecules with radiation tuned to their vibrational transitions heats or even dissociates the molecules. Because the vibrational transitions of molecules are dependent on the masses of the atoms, molecules containing different isotopes of a given atom exhibit different transition energies. Thus, molecules containing different isotopes of a given atom are heated or dissociated by bombardment with radiation of different frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A variety of laser sources are available with access to the near- and mid-infrared region, that could be used to dissociate molecules having vibrational transitions in that region. For example, transitions in the 9-10 &mgr;m range are accessible using a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>laser; various solid state lasers can access the near-infrared; and optical parametric oscillator technology can be utilized to achieve wide tunability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In order to separate one isotope of an atom from another using laser dissociation, a mixture of molecules including the different isotopes is bombarded with radiation (i.e., from a laser) tuned to the vibrational transition frequency of a first molecule including a first isotope. The first molecule therefore becomes excited and can be separated from other molecules in the mixture by virtue of its higher temperature, or its increased sensitivity to photodissociation. After the first isotope has been isolated, the radiation frequency can be adjusted by, for example, tuning the laser to a new frequency or providing an alternate laser source, so that the radiation frequency is tuned to the vibrational transition frequency of a second molecule, including a second isotope, and that second molecule can be isolated. The procedure is repeated until all desired isotopes are isolated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The outside chemical vapor deposition process involves the deposition of raw materials onto a rotating ceramic rod. This occurs in three steps: laydown, consolidation, and draw. During the laydown step, a soot prefrom is made from ultra-pure vapors of, for example, SiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The vapors move through a traversing burner and react in the flame with oxygen to form soot particles of silica (i.e., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). When the deposition is complete, the coated rod is heated and the rod is removed leaving behind a dense and transparent consolidated silica glass preform (the ceramic rod has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion, so it separates from the preform during the heat induced expansion). At this stage the silica preform has a hole in its center where the ceramic rod used to be. The preform is then drawn into a continuous strand of glass fiber and the hole disappears. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In each of these methods, the first step involves the formation of a silica (i.e., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) soot preform.

It will be appreciated, that the isotopic composition of the different regions of the optical waveguide of the invention made according to any of the methods described in Example 5-7, or any other suitable method of optical waveguide preparation, are determined by the isotopic composition of the incoming gaseous source of silicon and/or oxygen at the time that particular region was deposited. As a consequence, it will be appreciated that by varying the isotopic composition of the incoming source of silicon source and/or oxygen at different stages of optical waveguide preparation, a variety of types of optical waveguides can be assembled.

The refractive index profile of single-step optical waveguides exhibits a discontinuity in refractive index at the core/cladding interface. When assembling a single-step index optical waveguide, a first isotopic source of silicon and/or oxygen may be used to form the core and a second different isotopic source of silicon and/or oxygen may be used to form the cladding region of the optical waveguide. Preferably the isotopic source used for the core causes the refractive index of the core to be greater than the refractive index of the cladding region. For example, a single-step index optical waveguide may be formed from a core region that has been enriched in <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si and <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O, and a cladding region made of natural abundance silica. </paragraph>

The refractive index profile of single-step optical waveguides exhibits a series of discontinuities in refractive index at each cladding interface. When assembling a multi-step index optical waveguide, a first isotopic source of silicon and/or oxygen is used to form the core and a different isotopic source of silicon and/or oxygen is used to form each of the cladding regions of the optical waveguide. Preferably the isotopic source used in each cladding region causes the refractive index to decrease radially away from the core in a series of discrete steps, however the present invention is not limited to such designs, and in certain embodiments the change in refractive index may, for example, change sign several times as it progresses radially away from the core. In one embodiment of the present invention, the steps in refractive index between adjacent cladding regions are all substantially the same. In another embodiment of the present invention, the steps in refractive index between adjacent cladding regions are all substantially different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A multi-step index optical fiber may be designed for dispersion control and fabricated with multi-step index regions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>.

An outer core region II is fabricated with fused silica of natural isotope composition with the addition of a small amount of fluorine to lower the refractive index below that of region III. Indeed, it is known in the art that one can change the ultraviolet electronic transitions of a silica material with relatively small amounts of fluorine dopant in such a way, that the refractive index is lowered (see, for example, Sarkar, Chapter 4 of Optical Fiber Transmission, Indianapolis: Howard E.

<heading lvl="1">Graded Index Optical Waveguide </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Graded index optical waveguides comprise a core region and single cladding region. In certain embodiments, the refractive index profile of graded index optical waveguides made according to the present invention exhibit a discontinuity at the core/cladding interface. In other embodiments, the refractive index profile of graded index optical waveguides made according to the present invention exhibit a smooth continuous transition at the core/cladding interface. In preferred embodiments, the refractive index varies in a smooth manner within the cladding region. When assembling a graded-step index isotopic optical waveguide, a first isotopic source of silicon and/or oxygen is used to form the core and a gradually changing isotopic source of silicon and/or oxygen is used to form the cladding region of the optical waveguide. Preferably the gradually changing isotopic source used to construct the cladding region causes the refractive index to decrease radially away from the core in a smooth continuous manner, however the present invention is not limited to such a design, and in certain embodiments the gradient of refractive index change may, for example, change sign several times as it progresses radially away from the core. The refractive index may vary within the cladding region in a substantially linear manner as a consequence of the changing isotopic composition. In other embodiments, the refractive index may vary in a substantially parabolic manner. However, the present invention is not limited to particular designs and the refractive index profile may be described by any of a number of mathematical functions known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> For example, a fiber with a substantially continuous refractive index gradient (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) may be fabricated by constructing a preform using the method of outside chemical vapor deposition, in which the following four precursor gases: <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>SiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>SiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and <highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are used to deposit <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si&mdash;<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O, <highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>Si&mdash;<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>O, <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>Si&mdash;<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>O, and <highlight><superscript>28</superscript></highlight>Si&mdash;<highlight><superscript>16</superscript></highlight>O isotope mixtures such that the heavy isotope combinations are concentrated in the inner region of the core and the lighter isotope combinations are concentrated in the outer region of the cladding. </paragraph>

The planar waveguide requires that at least one region (hereinafter referred to as the guiding region) possess a refractive index higher than that of the lower region (the substrate region) and also higher than that of the upper region(s) (the cover region(s)). A region of relatively high refractive index may confine light by total internal reflection in one or more propagating modes. </paragraph>

The rectangular optical waveguide requires that the inner region (hereinafter referred to as the guiding region) possess a refractive index higher than any of the surrounding regions. A guiding region of relatively high refractive index may confine light by total internal reflection in one or more propagating modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the present invention is not limited to silica optical waveguides that employ silicon and/or oxygen isotopes. A waveguide (cylindrical, planar, or rectangular) may be fabricated from materials other than silica. For example, a gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor waveguide designed for infrared guiding may benefit from the use of a core material which comprises a heavy isotope mixture of gallium and arsenic. Semiconductor materials such as GaAs which possess infrared-active optical phonons are likely to benefit from lower vibrational absorption and provide a larger isotope-induced infrared index change than covalent semiconductors which are not infrared active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that the optical waveguide of the invention may be incorporated into any of a variety of optical devices.

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> An optical soliton is an optical pulse which, by virtue of balancing optical nonlinearity and dispersion, propagates long distances without significant broadening of the pulse. Loss limits the choice of center wavelengths for the soliton and also limits the maximum length of a single span in a soliton communication system. The present invention may be used to improve a soliton communication system by providing an optical waveguide with lower loss in the core over a wider range of wavelengths than is used in conventional soliton communication systems. </paragraph>

In particular, additional channels between 1.6 &mgr;m and 1.7 &mgr;m may be added to conventional communication systems by incorporating an optical waveguide which comprises an isotope mixture, for example, in its core. </paragraph>

The present invention may be used to improve a time-division multiplexed communication system by providing a lower loss wavelength region than that used in conventional systems. The use of an isotope mixture in the core of the fiber provides a lower loss than conventional optical waveguides, in particular at wavelengths greater than about 1.6 &mgr;m. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> An incident signal of frequency &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>traveling down an optical waveguide may be amplified by stimulated Raman scattering if a pump laser of frequency &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>l</subscript></highlight>, differing in energy by the optical phonon energy in silica &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>(i.e., &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>&plus;&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>), is injected into the fiber using a suitable frequency selective coupler. Raman amplifiers based on optical waveguides which employ a heavy isotope mixture in the core will, because of reduced loss, allow Raman amplification in the wavelength range between 1.6 &mgr;m and 1.7 &mgr;m, significantly increasing the number of communication channels that can be amplified by these devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Erbium Doped Amplification System </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the art that optical waveguides doped with some hundreds of parts per million of the rare-earth element erbium (Er) in the core provide gains to an optical signal when pumped by an optical source. The erbium ion (Er<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight>) is highly absorptive when pumped by a semiconductor laser with an emission power of approximately 50-100 milliwatts at a wavelength of 0.98 &mgr;m. The excited ion decays rapidly to a metastable state, where an incoming photon at a wavelength of 1.55 &mgr;m causes decay to the ground state by the emission of a photon of identical 1.55 &mgr;m wavelength. Erbium doped amplification systems based on optical waveguides which employ a heavy isotope mixture in the core will, because of reduced loss, allow more efficient amplification for optical wavelengths greater than 1.55 &mgr;m. It will be appreciated that ytterbium (Yb) doping can be used instead of or in combination with erbium doping. </paragraph>
