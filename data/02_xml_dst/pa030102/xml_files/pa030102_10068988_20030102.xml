<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a substrate for a semiconductor apparatus, such as a SOI substrate or FET having a MFS structure (metal-film/ferroelectric-material-film/semiconductor layer structure), in which a crystalline insulation layer is provided on a silicon substrate with an insulation layer exhibiting an electrical insulation property or a micro machining property interposed therebetween such that semiconductor crystal layer or a ferroelectric crystal layer can be grown, and a manufacturing method therefor. The substrate for the semiconductor device in this invention includes a substrate which can be a complete base for a semiconductor device and a base on which crystalline semiconductor layer and a dielectric layer, the substrate partly having an insulative silicon compound layer or a crystalline insulation layer as will be described hereinafter, a substrate to be provided on a laminated semiconductor layer, and a substrate for micro machining having a crystalline insulation layer with an insulation layer to improve a micro machining property. Particularly, the substrate for the micro machine is used when machining is effected on top or bottom of the substrate to permit repetitive fine mechanical deformation or vibration. An example of the substrate for macro machining comprises a silicon vibrational plate and a monocrystal PZT film formed thereon, wherein a liquid chamber is formed by etching a bottom side (unimorph structure), or a cantilever structure for reflecting light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As for a SOI substrate with which a semiconductor crystal layer is formed on an insulation layer, for example, there are known a method in which two silicon substrates <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having oxide films formed thereon are pasted to each other, and one of the substrates are removed by abrasion or etching so that thin semiconductor layer remains, or oxygen or the like is injected to a predetermined depth by ion injection from the surface of the silicon substrate, and then an annealing process is carried out, so that insulation layer is implanted into the semiconductor substrate. On the other hand., in a semiconductor memory device using a ferroelectric material layer, a ferroelectric material layer is laminated on a semiconductor layer, with or without an insulation film therebetween, or on a surface of an electrode metal such as platinum or the like. In the case of a MFS structure in which a ferroelectric material layer is laminated on a semiconductor layer, an oxide film is produced between the ferroelectric material layer and the semiconductor layer with the result of deterioration of the crystallinity or mofology and increase of interface level density between the ferroelectric material layer and the semiconductor layer. Even if a ferroelectric material layer is laminated on an insulation film, it is not possible to grow a ferroelectric material layer having a sufficient crystallinity on an amorphous insulation film. With a method in which metal is oxidized, and simultaneously the silicon is also oxidized, a high quality insulation layer is not provided, and in addition, the crystal insulation layer thereon does not exhibit a sufficient orientation. In a manufacturing process for a semiconductor device, there is a case in which epitaxial growth of a semiconductor layer, a crystalline dielectric layer or the like is required on a semiconductor substrate with an insulation layer therebetween, but it is not possible to directly laminate a layer having a high crystallinity on the surface of an insolation layer. Recently, however, using said pasting method, a SOI method has been put into practice in which one of the silicon layer is thinned by abrasion, etching or water knife, but with this method, a very expensive process is required, so that substrate per se is expensive. For a structure for micro machine or the like, an inexpensive substrate and manufacturing method therefor are desired. In a method in which oxygen or the like in implanted in the surface layer portion of the semiconductor substrate, the deterioration of the surface of the semiconductor layer by the ion implanting is significant, and the ion injection is again expensive, and therefore, the same problems are involved. As for a method in which epitaxial growth of YSZ thin film is effected an a silicon substrate, there is method disclosed in SHINGAKU GIHOU (ED96-42, CPM36-27, May, 1996) or a method disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application Hei 07-150361. According to these methods, an insulation layer having a crystalline property can be provided on a silicon substrate, and a semiconductor layer or ferroelectric material layer can be formed on the surface through epitaxial growth. However, the YSZ thin film formed on the silicon substrate is a crystalline metal oxide involving ion movement, and therefore, electrical insulation and the etching stop property when used for micro machining, are poorer than the silicon oxide film or the silicon nitride film, with the result of slight deterioration of the performance. Japanese Laid-open Patent Application Hei 10-265948 discloses that amorphous silicon oxide film is forced on crystalline silicon, and a crystalline insulation layer is further formed. This method is equivalent to a technique of forming an amorphous silicon oxide layer and a crystalline insulation layer within oxygen ambience as disclosed in No. 167 KENKYUKAISHIRYO (42-43) in a 131st thin film Committee of Japan GAKUJUTU SINKOUKAI held in HAKUUNRO HOTEL, May 31-Jun. 1, 1993, and these methods involve a problem that resultant amorphous layer contains a large amount of impurity element because of introduction of oxygen during sputtering operation. Although the crystallinity of the produced crystalline insulation layer exhibits YSZ (111) matchable with silicon lattice matching, the orientation in the plane is not possible, so that no complete epitaxial layer can not be provided. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the substrate for the semiconductor device comprises a (crystalline) silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a crystalline insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> such as YSZ or the like, and an insulative silicon compound layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as silicon oxide film or the like which exhibits a high electrical insulation property and etching stop property. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a silicon monocrystal layer of n-type, p-type or a type in which n-type region or p-type region is formed, and a semiconductor circuit is formed, or a type in which a silicon semiconductor layer is formed on another semiconductor layer or the like through epitaxial growth at its entire or partial surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The crystalline insulation layer (monocrystal insulation layer) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a metal oxide with which a crystalline structure can be formed, and it may be YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia), Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(sapphire), CeO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(ceria), MgO (magnesia), SrTiO3 (strontium titanate), ZrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(zirconia) or the like with which a crystalline structure of a metal compound can be provided in the non-active gas. The thickness thereof, although it is different depending on the usage, is normally 5-2 nm for a background for the growth of another semiconductor layer or crystalline dielectric layer, and it may be approx. 0.5-3 &mgr;m depending on the usage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The insulative silicon oxide <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be a silicon oxide such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, a silicon nitride such as Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, silicon oxide nitride such as SiON. In the case of these compounds, with growth of the crystalline insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, reaction occurs between the silicon in the substrate and the oxygen and/or nitrogen penetrating the crystalline insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and is limited to a compound of a material penetrating the crystalline insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. During formation of the insulative silicon compound layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, element component constituting the crystalline insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is diffused and introduced. As readers the impurity element which is diffused and introduced, the inventors have revealed that insulation property and the etching property changes in accordance with the concentration of the impurity element. As will be described hereinafter which Table 3, when the impurity element concentration (not less than 0 at %) is not more than 10 at %, the insulation property is high; and when it is not more than 7 at %, particularly not more than 5 at %, the etching property is high. On the basis of these findings, the concentration of the component element of material which constitutes the crystalline insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and which is diffused and introduced into the insulative silicon compound layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is controlled to be not more than 10 at %, preferably not more them 5 at %. The thickness of the insulative silicon compound layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is determined in consideration of the insulation property, etching stop property, micro machining property or the like, depending on the usage. Normally, it is 10-6 nm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the semiconductor device substrate of this embodiment, the monocrystal insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided on the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the amorphous insulation film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> therebetween, and therefore, the substrate has excellent electrical insulation property, etching stop property and micro machining property. In addition, the surface has a crystalline structure, and therefore, a semiconductor layer or a monocrystal dielectric layer can be found on its surface through epitaxial growth. Since there is an amorphous insulation film <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of silicon compound between the silicon crystal layer <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the monocrystal insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the insulation property is excellent, and therefore, the electrical insulation is very high between the layer formed on the surface of the crystalline insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> therebelow. The monocrystal insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as described herein before, is a metal compound, and therefore, ions are movable, and the insulation property is slightly poor, but the silicon oxide or silicon nitride (silicon compound) exhibits excellent electrical property. When the crystalline insulation layer is produced by reaction with metal using reactive gas, a large amount of impurity element is refused to the SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer interface which is an insulative silicon compound layer, and therefore, sufficient insulation property or etching stop property is not provided. However, according to an embodiment of the present invention using a non-active gas such as Ar or the like, which will be described hereinafter, the impurity diffusion adjacent the interface can be suppressed to not more than 10 at %. By limiting the impurity element concentration (not less than 0 at %) to not more than 10 at %, the insulation property is excellent, and in addition by limiting it to not more than 7 at %, particularly, not more than 5 at %, the etching property is excellent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> SOI substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be provided by forming a film of crystalline silicon <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the crystalline insulation layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the semiconductor device substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, or a YSZ layer may be further formed on the SOI substrate to provide a substrate in which the crystal silicon layer is sandwiched by insulative oxide layers. In addition, on a silicon crystal layer having a semiconductor circuit pattern thereon, a semiconductor layer is further formed with an insulation layer therebetween to form a three dimensional circuit. A crystalline dielectric layer of ferroelectric material can be formed with a clean crystalline structure to provide a high performance semiconductor memory device. A Si monocrystal portion of the above-described sandwich structure may be used as a vibrational plate, an electrode and PZT or PMN is formed on the insulative crystal YSZ through the epitaxial growth, which can be used as a micro actuator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</cross-reference>, the description will be made as to a manufacturing method for a semiconductor device substrate according to an embodiment of the present invention, with which a crystal of crystalline insulation layer (YSZ) is grown on a silicon substrate with a silicon oxide film therebetween. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> schematically shows an example of a sputtering apparatus for epitaxial growth, which is usable for manufacturing the substrate for the semiconductor device according to the embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of introduction, after completion of film formation by the sputtering apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, of oxygen with the temperature during the film formation; in (a) dry O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is supplied; and in (b) water vapor O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is supplied. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic view illustrating an annealing process in the manufacturing method for the semiconductor device substrate according to the embodiment of the present invention; in (a) Ar&plus;dry O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is supplied; in (b) Ar&plus;water vapor O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is supplied. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> One side wall of the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided with an introduction tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for introduction of the gas, through which non-active gas (Ar) is supplied into the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The other side wall of the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided with a gas discharge opening <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A heater <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is used to control heating and cooling of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> heated by the heater <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located right above the target <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a gap of 3 cm. With the state, the sputtering film formation is carried out. As regards the temperature of the heater <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> hearing the film forming operation, the substrate temperature is not lower than 400&deg; C., more particularly 600&deg; C. or 800&deg; C. for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Using such a sputtering apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the non-active gas (Ar) is introduced into the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the introduction tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the substrate is heated by the heater <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to a temperature of not lower than 400&deg; C., for example 600&deg; C. or 800&deg; C., and the high oscillation voltage source is actuated to cause Ar discharge.

Table 1 shows a relation between a thickness of the oxide film layer and a temperature holding time under the constant temperature heating condition (600&deg; C. and 800&deg; C. which is the film formation temperature) after the completion of the heating film formation. In the case that quick cooling was effected with the Ar replacement without keeping the temperature after the completion of the film formation, the increase of the oxide film layer (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) was not observed. From Table 1, it is understood that thickness of the oxide layer (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) increases when the holding time is long and the atmosphere is water vapor O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, designated by <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is an electric furnace including a heater <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on its wall, and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is a substrate mount for mounting the substrate <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which contains a heater therein. Designated by <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a gas introduction opening for permitting introduction of gas into the electric furnace <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The gas introduction opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided with a dryer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a filter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> ((<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) which are connected in series. There is further provided water vapor generating means <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for generating water vapor by heating pure water ((<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Using such an apparatus, the annealing process is effected to the substrate for a predetermined time while keeping the temperature at not less than 600&deg; C. (annealing temperature). In the annealing process, the temperature has been set at 600&deg; C., 800&deg; C. and 1000&deg; C., and the investigations has been made as to the relation among the thickness of the oxide film layer, the annealing temperature and the process time under the atmosphere of dry O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and water vapor O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The results are shown in Table 2. As will be understood from Table 2, the oxide layer can be formed irrespective of the film, thickness of the YSZ, and the annealing process can increase the oxide layer when the annealing temperature is high, and the atmosphere is the oxygen including the water vapor.

The distribution of the component element is such that it is large adjacent the interface between the crystalline insulative material layer and the insulative silicon compound layer, and gradually decreases away from the crystalline insulative material layer. Thus, the component element of the material constituting the crystalline insulative material is introduced and mixed into the insulative silicon compound layer, and the etching property and insulation property changes in accordance with the impurity concentration. As will be described hereinafter, sufficient insulation property and etching stop property are provided by limiting the impurity concentration to not more than 10 at %, preferably not more than 5 at %. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As will be understood from Tables 4 and 5, the oxide layer provided by the sputtering in the non-active gas atmosphere according to the present invention exhibits good etching property and electrical insulation property. On the contrary, the oxide layer provided by a reactive sputtering exhibits poor insulation property and etching stop function, and it is not suitable for a semiconductor substrate or a substrate for micro machining. In the foregoing Embodiments, the substrate temperature is 600&deg; C. or 800&deg; C. However, it has been confirmed that same advantageous effects are provided when it is 400&deg; C. In the foregoing embodiments, the crystal layer of YSZ is grown using a multiple oxide target comprising Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and ZrO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, but it is possible to grow the crystal layer using a SrTiO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>as the target. By using Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>for the target, the crystal layer of Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can be similarly grown, and similarly, a crystal layer of MgO or ZrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be grown. </paragraph>
