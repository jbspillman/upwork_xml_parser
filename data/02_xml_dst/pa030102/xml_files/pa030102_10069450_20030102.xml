<section>
<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method for producing a shaft, and an apparatus containing such a shaft according to the general class of the independent claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An apparatus was made known in the German utility-model patent GM 297 02 525.2 that is used, for example, to move window panes, sunroofs, or seats. In order to prevent an undesired axial end play of the armature shaft, it is proposed there that a damper rubber be pressed into a recess of the housing on at least one of its faces. The armature shaft presses a stop disk against this damping rubber. By means of the firmly locking into position and the elastic properties of the damping rubber, the armature shaft remains firmly fixed in place despite ageing processes and signs of wear. Additionally, the armature shaft can be installed very easily and cost-effectively together with the damping rubber. However, the elimination of the axial end play of the armature by means of such a damping rubber limits the maximally permissible tolerance in the production of the armature shaft. Narrower tolerances lead to higher production costs, however, which are undesired in a mass production of the armature shaft. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The method according to the invention having the features of claim 1 has the advantage that the favorable offset of end play with the damping rubber can continue to be used even when the shaft is fabricated not very exact to length in production. By introducing an additional working step, the manufacturing-related length of the shaft subject to tolerance can be decoupled from the elimination of the end play of the shaft. This also makes a very cost-effective and simple manufacture of the endless screw on the armature shaft possible. The end play is suppressed even more reliably as compared with earlier means for attaining the object of the invention, because the tolerance stack-ups are markedly lower after the material displacement than before. The useful life of the armature shaft is increased as a result and clicking noises produced when the direction of rotation changes are reliably prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Advantageous further developments of the method according to claim 1 are made possible by means of the features listed in the subclaims. If the material displacement takes place near an end of the shaft, the stability of the shaft across the entire length is largely maintained. Additionally, the material displacement at this point does not take up any additional space. If the material displacement is carried out by means of burnishing, this is a cost-effective, exact and easy-to-use process. Burnishing brings about a continuous elongation of the shaft that can be well-controlled. The burnishing results in an even constriction, which also has a very advantageous effect on the stability of the shaft. It is also possible to achieve the material displacement simply by means of squeezing, however. Such a working step is less expensive than burnishing, but it does not entirely achieve the same dimensional accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> If the length of the shaft is measured during the material displacement, the nominal dimension of the shaft can be achieved rapidly and exactly in one working cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It proves to be particularly favorable when the shaft is installed in the pole well of the electric motor before the material displacement is started. The tolerances that are stacking up are eliminated as a result. Moreover, the armature shaft then lies in &ldquo;its&rdquo; bearings, so that the dimensional accuracy and the position of the material displacement can be coordinated with the eventual site of application, particularly when burnishing the material displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous to measure the length of the part of the installed shaft extending over the pole well, because the shaft can then be produced to the nominal dimension in the installed state. As a result, the tolerance stack-up of the end play can be markedly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further alternative is to measure the set value for the end play during material displacement with the shaft in the installed state. This has the advantage that the measured value of greatest interest&mdash;the end play&mdash;can be measured directly and it can be adjusted exactly to the set value by means of the material displacement. With this method, all manufacturing and fitting tolerances are completely eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Efficient process engineering is a further advantage of material displacement by means of burnishing. The endless screw of the armature shaft can be produced and the material displacement can be carried out using just one tool. Even if one tool each is used for the burnishing of the endless screw and the burnishing of the material displacement, one complete working step is spared, because the shaft need be chucked only once for this process. This makes rapid and cost-effective production possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The apparatus according to the invention having the features of the independent claim 9 has the advantage that a high-quality product with narrow tolerances is created despite initially great production tolerances of the shaft after installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The material displacement located at the end of the shaft and the semicircular cross-sectional area of the circumferential groove have an advantageous effect on the preservation of stability of the shaft. It is advantageous that the shaft diameter can be reduced up to one-half of the original value. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An adjusting drive <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> that comprises a motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a multisectional housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> enclosing a gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is electrically commutated and comprises an armature <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a commutator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and an armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> supported in bearings in multiple locations that extends into the region of the gear <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An endless screw <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that communicates with a worm gear <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is rolled onto the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This is supported at the faces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> via stop disks <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and at the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or a part of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via a damping means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises a recess <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the region of the face <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, into which a damping rubber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is pressed as damping means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The damping rubber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> comprises a firmly specified elastic region <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The conception according to the invention therefore consists of the fact that the tolerances of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the housing parts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, together with the assembly tolerances, may not exceed the dimension of the elastic region <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), in order to effectively prevent play in the armature shaft. Instead of the damping rubber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, other damping means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> such as spring elements or rigid stops are feasible as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to adhere to such a narrow tolerance, according to the invention, the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is brought to a nominal dimension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by means of material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> after the endless screw <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is rolled on. The tolerance of this nominal dimension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is markedly smaller than the elastic region <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the damping rubber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is realized by constricting the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, by way of which the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> increases. The material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is applied to one end region <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> between the endless screw <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the face <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a region where the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not radially supported in bearings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Methods of material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are also feasible in which the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is swaged, which would result in a shortening of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Theoretically, there are a plurality of points on the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> where a material displacement would not disturb the structure. In order to maintain the overall stability of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, however, it presents itself to displace material on the ends <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the region toward their faces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A simple method for material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is given by the burnishing of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on its end <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. This method is to be preferred over others because a burnishing device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> must be held in front anyway in order to produce the endless screw <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The burnishing for material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can thereby be carried out in one working step, i.e., simultaneously with the burnishing of the endless screw <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, or one directly after the other during one chucking on the burnishing machine <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The length of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is measured simultaneously during the material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is deformed until the length measurement of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> shows the nominal dimension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The nominal dimension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is thereby based on the entire length of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> between its two faces <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a second exemplary embodiment, the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is installed in a part of the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&mdash;in a pole well housing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in this case&mdash;before its length is changed. The part of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extending over the pole well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is thereby measured simultaneously during its material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In this case, the nominal dimension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is only based on the part of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extending out over the pole well <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The tolerances of the field frame <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can thereby be eliminated as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a further exemplary embodiment, the length of the armature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not measured as a nominal dimension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, but rather, the axial end play <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&Prime; (indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> with a dotted line) of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is measured directly in its installed state. After the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is completely installed and the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fully assembled, the material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is thereby carried out via one or more openings in the housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The armature axial end play <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&Prime; is measured by means of an electric voltage or the current drawn by the electric motor that is applied to the electric motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the end play is great, the motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches its final speed already at relatively low amperage. If the length of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is now extended during the current measurement in this case, the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> presses axially against the damping rubber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at any time. As soon as the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> touches the damping rubber <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a certain braking torque is produced that can be measured via an increase in current or a decrease in speed of the motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the current and/or the speed reach certain values, this is an indication that the end play has been eliminated or stopped in predetermined fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on the end <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the armature shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in detail. The material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is shaped in the form of a ring groove, i.e., encircling the entire shaft. Such a groove <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is easy to produce by means of burnishing. The cross-sectional area <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the groove <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is semicircular, i.e., the more the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> must be elongated, the deeper a segment of a circle is pressed into the shaft. It must be ensured that the cross-section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not reduced to too great of an extent at the point of material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. A reduction of the shaft diameter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to 50% of the original value is regarded as the limit value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In further exemplary embodiments, the cross-sectional area <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the ring-shaped groove <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has a form other than a semicircular form. This is the case, for example, when the burnishing tool <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is not shaped radially, but rather takes on another, random shape. Possible shapes of the cross-sectional area <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are a trapezoid <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&prime; or a rectangle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>&Prime; (dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). With such a profile, more material is displaced along one side of the trapezoid or rectangle from the beginning onward during burnishing, while little material is displaced at the beginning with a semicircular profile of the groove <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is also feasible that the groove <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is not ring-shaped around the entire circumference of the shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, but rather comprises one or more notches distributed around the circumference, for example. Such a method creates difficulties, however, with regard for a precise nominal dimension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, or it can produce unbalanced states. The selection of the exact point of material displacement <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is variable between the face <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the start of the endless screw <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the motor shaft <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
