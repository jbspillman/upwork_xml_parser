<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional part-mounting apparatus for use in fabricating a flat panel display represented by a liquid crystal panel mounts a flexible electronic part, such as a FPC (flexible printed circuit), a COF (chip-on-film) circuit, a TCP (tape carrier package) or the like on a glass substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally, such a part-mounting apparatus includes a substrate carrying device for positioning a glass substrate at a working position and carrying a glass substrate between working positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> show a conventional substrate carrying device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the substrate carrying device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> capable of translational movement and rotation in an XY-plane, and a substrate support member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> attached to the transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to support a glass substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Glass substrates for flat panel displays or the like are formed in different sizes corresponding to the types of flat panel displays. Therefore, the substrate carrying device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is required to carry those glass substrates having different sizes. When conducting changing work for changing the types of flat panel displays, the substrate support member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the conventional substrate carrying device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is replaced with another one of a size corresponding to that of a new type of flat panel displays. More concretely, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>, a substrate support member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for carrying small substrates <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is attached to the transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> when the substrate carrying device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is used for carrying the small substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>), and a substrate support member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for carrying large substrates <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; is attached to the transfer mechanism <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> when the substrate carrying device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is used for carrying the large substrate <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime;, (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus the conventional substrate carrying device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> changes the substrate support members when the types of flat panel displays are changed to use a substrate support member of a size corresponding to that of glass substrates to be carried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, the size of glass substrates for forming flat panel displays has progressively enlarged in recent years and the weight of the substrate support member of the substrate carrying device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has increased accordingly. Therefore, changing the substrate support members requires very difficult work and much time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing problems and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a substrate carrying device and a substrate carrying method capable of reducing time necessary for achieving changing work for changing the types of flat panel displays, a part-mounting apparatus provided with the substrate carrying device, and a part-mounting method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, a substrate carrying device includes a transfer mechanism; and a substrate support member attached to the transfer mechanism and supporting a substrate, wherein the substrate support member includes a connecting part for connecting the substrate support member to an extension support member so as to support the substrate in cooperation with the substrate support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the substrate carrying device according to the first aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the substrate support member includes a support body having a support surface, the support body having a peripheral connecting part adapted to be joined to a peripheral connecting part formed in the extension support member. Preferably, the substrate support member includes a support body having a support surface; a suction member attached to the support surface of the support body and adapted to attract and hold the substrate; a suction passage extended in the support body and connected to the suction member; and a connecting structure for connecting the suction passage to a suction passage included in the extension support member, and wherein the connecting structure connects the suction passage of the substrate support member to the suction passage of the extension support member when the extension support member is connected to the substrate support member. Preferably, the substrate support member includes a support body having a support surface; a suction member attached to the support surface of the support body and adapted to attract and hold the substrate; and a flatness adjusting mechanism for adjusting the flatness of the substrate held by the suction member. Preferably, the extension support member includes a support body having a support surface; a suction member attached to the support surface of the support body and adapted to attract and hold the substrate; and a flatness adjusting mechanism for adjusting the flatness of the substrate held by the suction member. Preferably, the substrate carrying device further includes an electronic part support member for supporting an electronic part mounted on the substrate. Preferably, the substrate carrying device further includes a detecting device that detects the condition of connection of the extension support member to the substrate support member; and a decision device that decides whether or not a substrate to be carried is suitable for carrying, on the basis of the result of detection by the detecting device and the size of the substrate to be carried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, a substrate carrying device includes a transfer mechanism; and a substrate support member attached to the transfer mechanism and supporting a substrate, wherein the substrate support member includes a first support part, and a second support part movably connected to the first support part so as to support the substrate in cooperation with the first support part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is preferable that the substrate carrying device according to the second aspect of the present invention further includes a driving mechanism that drives the second support part for movement relative to the first support part; and a controller that controls a distance for which the second support parts is moved by the driving mechanism, on the basis of the size of the substrate to be carried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention, a substrate carrying method includes the steps of: supporting a substrate on a substrate support member attached to a transfer mechanism; and carrying the substrate, wherein an extension support member for supporting the substrate in cooperation with the substrate support member can be detachably attached to the substrate support member, so that the substrate support member and the extension support member are used in either a state where only the substrate support member is used, or a state where the substrate support member is combined with the extension support member, depending on the size of the substrate to be carried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, a part-mounting apparatus of mounting an electronic part on a substrate includes: a substrate carrying device that carries the substrate to a working position; a part carrying device that carries the electronic part to a mounting position corresponding to the substrate positioned at the working position; and a pressing tool that presses, at the mounting position, the electronic part carried by the part carrying device to the substrate carried by the substrate carrying device so as to mount the electronic part on the substrate, wherein the substrate carrying device includes a substrate support member for supporting the substrate, the substrate support member including a connecting part for connecting the substrate support member to an extension support member so as to support the substrate in cooperation with the substrate support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, a part-mounting method of mounting an electronic part on a substrate includes the steps of: supporting a substrate on a substrate support member included in a substrate carrying device; positioning the substrate at a working position by the substrate carrying device; carrying an electronic part to a mounting position corresponding to the substrate positioned at the working position; and pressing, at the mounting position, the electronic part carried by the part carrying device to the substrate positioned at the working position by the substrate carrying device to mount the electronic part on the substrate, wherein the substrate support member includes a connecting part for connecting the substrate support member to an extension support member so as to support the substrate in cooperation with the substrate support member, and the step of supporting the substrate by the substrate carrying device includes a step of handling the extension support member to connect the extension support member to the substrate support member by the connecting part or to disconnect the same from the substrate support member, depending on the size of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the first, the third, the fourth and the fifth aspect of the present invention, the extension support member can be connected to the substrate support member attached to the transfer mechanism or the like, in order to support a substrate in cooperation with the substrate support member. Therefore, it is possible to cope with the change of the sizes of the substrates resulting from the change of the types of flat panel displays or the like, by connecting the extension support member to or disconnecting the same from the substrate support member. Only the comparatively light part, i.e., the extension support member, needs to be changed instead of changing the entire structure for supporting a substrate, i.e., the substrate support member and the extension support member, to carry a large substrate. Since the operator is able to handle the extension support member easily, time necessary for conducting changing work for changing the types of flat display panels or the like can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the first aspect of the present invention, the substrate support member and the extension support member can be easily connected together simply by joining the engaging part formed in the peripheral part of the support body of the substrate support member to the end part of the extension support member. The suction passage of the substrate support member and that of the extension support member can be connected by a connecting structure when the substrate support member and the extension support member are combined together. Thus both the respective suction passages of the substrate support member and the extension support member can be easily connected with both the respective suction members of the substrate support member and the extension support member being in suction by the same vacuum source for suction. Since the substrate support member or the extension support member includes the suction member attached to the support surface of the support body and adapted to attract and hold the substrate, and the flatness adjusting mechanism for adjusting the flatness of the substrate held by the suction member, the flatness of a peripheral part of the substrate mounted with an electronic part can be easily adjusted and hence the electronic part can be satisfactorily mounted on the substrate. The electronic part mounted on the substrate can be effectively prevented from drooping by using the electronic part support member for supporting the electronic part mounted on the substrate. Since the decision device decides whether or not a substrate to be carried is suitable for carrying, on the basis of the result of detection of the condition of connection of the extension support member to the substrate support member and the size of the substrate to be carried, measures to cope with the change of the types of flat panel displays or the like can be surely taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the second aspect of the present invention, since the substrate support member includes the second support part adapted to be movably connected to the first support part, it is possible to cope with the change of the types of flat panel displays or the like and the resultant change of the sizes of the substrates, simply by moving the second support part, so that time necessary for conducting changing work for changing the types of flat display panels or the like can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the second aspect of the present invention, since a distance for which the second support part is moved is controlled on the basis of the size of the substrate to be carried, measures to cope with the change of the types of flat panel displays or the like can be surely taken in a short time.</paragraph>
