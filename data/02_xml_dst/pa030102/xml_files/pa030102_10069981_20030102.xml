<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to dispersions, especially cosmetic dispersions, comprising at least one aqueous phase and at least one oily phase. Such dispersions may be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion, in the form of a water-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsion, or alternatively in the form of a multiphase composition consisting of a dispersion of mineral and/or organic particles in the aqueous phase of an oil-in-water emulsion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates more particularly to the stabilization of such dispersions over a wide range of temperatures ranging from 4 to 50&deg; C., without harming their properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the cosmetic field, it is essential for a dispersion such as a suspension or an emulsion to be stable over a wide temperature range. The reason for this is that, during its lifetime, the cosmetic dispersion may be exposed to temperatures ranging from 4&deg; C. to a minimum &plus;50&deg; C. depending on the climatic, storage and/or transportation conditions. For example, it is necessary for a cream that is transported in a car which could spend a long time in the sunshine, that is to say at a temperature readily reaching 50&deg; C., to conserve its stability. It is also necessary for these creams to be able to be used in hot countries without any problems arising as regards their transportation and storage. The instability of a dispersion is generally reflected by a macroscopic demixing, resulting in separation into at least two phases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, cosmetic compositions must show satisfactory stability in storage cycles. A storage cycle consists in passing the composition through several successive temperatures. Thus, the composition is maintained for a certain period (for example for 6 hours) at room temperature (about &plus;20&deg; C.), then over the same period (i.e. 6 hours) the temperature is reduced to about 4&deg; C., the composition is then left at this temperature of 4&deg; C. for the same period of time again (i.e. 6 hours) and the temperature is then raised to room temperature (&plus;20&deg; C.) over the same period of time (6 hours), and this is repeated several times (generally 5 times) This passage through various temperatures makes it possible to test the satisfactory stability of a composition. Now, it is advantageous for cosmetic compositions to have excellent stability, irrespective of the conditions under which they are found. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the case of cosmetic dispersions consisting of oil-in-water emulsions, water-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsions, and dispersions of mineral and/or organic particles in the aqueous phase of an oil-in-water emulsion, the stability of these dispersions is generally weakened when the temperature increases, on account of the fall in viscosity of the aqueous phase. This is reflected by a phenomenon of sedimentation when the dispersed phase has a density greater than that of the continuous aqueous phase; this is the case for many aqueous suspensions of mineral particles. When the dispersed phase is less dense than the continuous aqueous phase, a phenomenon of creaming takes place, such as, for example, in the case of emulsions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to ensure the stability of such dispersions for temperatures ranging from 4 to 50&deg; C., use has been made of aqueous-phase gelling agents such as crosslinked polyacrylic acid derivatives (Carbopols sold by Goodrich) and natural polymers such as xanthan gum (Keltrol T sold by Kelco). The use of such gelling agents limits the range of textures available to the gelled formations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would therefore be necessary to be able to use other compounds making it possible, on the one hand, to ensure the stability of cosmetic dispersions at temperatures from 4&deg; C. to 50&deg; C. and, on the other hand, to maintain a wide range of textures available at room temperature, with fluid or gelled formulations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One subject of the present invention is, precisely, the use of a polymer comprising water-soluble units and units with an LCST, added to the aqueous phase of such dispersions, to ensure the stability of these dispersions when they are subjected to temperature variations in the range from 4 to 50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, a subject of the present invention is a dispersion comprising at least one aqueous phase and at least one oily phase, characterized in that the aqueous phase comprises a polymer comprising water-soluble units and units with an LCST, the units with an LCST having in water a demixing temperature of from 5 to 40&deg; C. at a concentration of 1% by mass, and the polymer being present in the aqueous phase at a concentration such that the gel point of the aqueous phase is from 5 to 40&deg; C. and preferably from 10 to 35&deg; C., to ensure the stability of the dispersion when it is subjected to temperature variations in the range from 4 to 50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the dispersion may be formed by an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion in which water is the aqueous phase, by a water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) multiple emulsion, or alternatively by a dispersion of mineral and/or organic particles in the aqueous phase of an oil-in-water emulsion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Polymers comprising water-soluble units and units with an LCST have been described in the following documents: D. Hourdet et al., Polymer, 1994, Vol. 35, No. 12, pages 2624 to 2630 &lsqb;1&rsqb;; F. L&apos;Alloret et al., Coll. Polym. Sci., 1995, Vol. 273, No. 12, pages 1163-1173 &lsqb;2&rsqb;; F. L&apos;Alloret et al., Revue de l&apos;Institut Fran<custom-character file="US20030004258A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00001"/>ais du P&eacute;trole, 1997, Vol. 52, No. 2, pages 117-128 &lsqb;3&rsqb;; EP-A-0 583 814 &lsqb;4&rsqb; and EP-A-0 629 649 &lsqb;5&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As described in these documents, these polymers comprise water-soluble units and units with an LCST, which have in water a lower critical solution temperature. Thus, these units with an LCST are units whose solubility in water is modified beyond a certain temperature. They are units having a heat-induced demixing temperature (or cloud point) defining their region of water solubility. The minimum demixing temperature obtained as a function of the polymer concentration is known as the &ldquo;LCST&rdquo; (Lower Critical Solution Temperature). For each polymer concentration, a heat-induced demixing temperature is observed; it is higher than the LCST, which is the minimum point of the curve. Below this temperature, the polymer is water-soluble, and above this temperature, the polymer loses its water solubility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, these polymers have water-gelling properties brought about by increasing the temperature. These properties may be exploited for uses in the petroleum field, as described in documents &lsqb;4&rsqb; and &lsqb;5&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> WO-A-95/24430 &lsqb;6&rsqb; also describes copolymers comprising units with an LCST and pH-sensitive units, which have heat-induced gelling properties. For use for the controlled release of active principles in the pharmaceutical field and in the cosmetic field. The gels obtained are opaque and have an LCST, unlike the polymers of the invention which comprise chains with an LCST but whose overall behaviour is not of LCST type and which lead to transparent compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a polymer is chosen whose units with an LCST have a demixing temperature of from 5 to 40&deg; C. at a concentration of 1% by mass, so as to obtain the gelation of an aqueous phase containing this polymer in the desired range. Furthermore, the polymer concentration used is sufficient to allow interactions between units with an LCST borne by different macromolecules, and to obtain this gelation of the aqueous phase, thus making it possible to ensure the stability of the dispersion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the case of cosmetic dispersions in which the desired texture is obtained by means of a standard gelling agent, when the temperature increases, the gelling agent used at the start becomes fluidized. According to the invention, by virtue of the presence of the polymer comprising water-soluble units and units with an LCST, this heat-induced reduction in viscosity does not take place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> These gelling properties are observed when the polymer concentration is sufficient to allow interactions between units with an LCST borne by different macromolecules. The minimum concentration required, known as the &ldquo;critical aggregation concentration&rdquo;, or CAC, is evaluated by Theological measurements: it is the concentration at and above which the viscosity of an aqueous solution of a polymer the invention becomes higher than the viscosity of a solution of the equivalent polymer not comprising chains with an LCST. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Beyond the CAC, the polymers of the invention have gelling properties when the temperature becomes higher than a critical value, known as the &ldquo;gel point&rdquo;, or T<highlight><subscript>gel</subscript></highlight>. According to the literature data, there is good agreement between the T<highlight><subscript>gel </subscript></highlight>and the demixing temperature of the chains with an LCST, under the same concentration conditions. The gel point of an aqueous solution of a polymer of the invention is determined by rheological measurements: it is the temperature at and above which the viscosity of the polymer solution becomes higher than the viscosity of the solution of the equivalent polymer not comprising LCST units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The polymers used in the invention are characterized by a gel point ranging from 5&deg; C. to 40&deg; C. and preferably from 10&deg; C. to 35&deg; C. for a concentration in water equal to 2% by mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,485 &lsqb;7&rsqb; and WO 97/00275 &lsqb;8&rsqb; describe reversible-gelling polymer systems comprising a sensitive component capable of aggregating in response to a change in an external stimulus and a structural component. The external stimulus may be the temperature. The sensitive component may be a block copolymer such as a Poloxamer, for example a Pluronic&reg;, which aggregates microscopically beyond a critical temperature not corresponding to an LCST. A nonionic surfactant may also be used as a sensitive component. These polymers have heat-induced gelling properties and may be used in the pharmaceutical field to deliver medicinal products and in many other fields including the cosmetics field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In these formulations, the sensitive component of the polymer system has a different behaviour from that of units with an LCST during heating. Thus, when it is heated to about 30-40&deg; C., it exhibits a temperature of micellization, that is to say an aggregation at the microscopic level, and then, when it is heated further, a higher LCST temperature. This LCST corresponds to a macroscopic aggregation between the molecules. It is explained in WO-A-97/00275 &lsqb;8&rsqb; on pages 16 and 17 that the gelation and the LCST are observed at temperatures that differ by about 70&deg; C. This shows that these polymers are different from the polymers of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Document WO-A-98/48768 &lsqb;9&rsqb; also discloses cosmetic compositions using a reversible heat-induced gelling polymer system, comprising polyacrylic acid and a poloxamer. This polymer is thus different from the polymers of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The systems with reversible gelation described in documents &lsqb;7&rsqb;, &lsqb;8&rsqb; and &lsqb;9&rsqb; are different from the polymer systems used in the invention. Firstly, the heat-sensitive units do not have a demixing temperature in the range from 5 to 40&deg; C. Secondly, unlike the polymers used in the invention, in which the demixing temperature of the chains with an LCST corresponds substantially to the gel point under the same concentration conditions, the heat sensitive units of these polymers have a demixing temperature that is very far from the gel point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it was not envisaged to use these polymer systems to stabilize dispersions such as suspensions and emulsions, subjected to temperature variations in the range from 4 to 50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The polymers used in the invention may be block polymers or grafted polymers, which comprise, on the one hand, water-soluble units and, on the other hand, units with an LCST as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The polymers used in the context of the invention may thus be block polymers comprising, for example, water-soluble blocks alternating with blocks with an LCST. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> These polymers may also be in the form of grafted polymers whose backbone is formed from water-soluble units, bearing grafts with an LCST. This structure may be partially crosslinked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is pointed out that, in the present text, the terms &ldquo;water-soluble unit&rdquo; and &ldquo;LCST unit&rdquo; do not include the group linking together, on the one hand, the water-soluble units and, on the other hand, the units with an LCST, the linking units being derived from the reaction of the reactive sites borne, on the one hand, by water-soluble units and, on the other hand, by units with an LCST. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Water-soluble units in these polymers are units that are soluble in water at a temperature of from 5&deg; C. to 80&deg; C., to a proportion of at least 10 g/l and preferably at least 20 g/l. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> However, the term &ldquo;water-soluble units&rdquo; also means units not necessarily having the solubility mentioned above, but which in aqueous solution at 1% by weight, from 5&deg; C. to 80&deg; C., allow the production of a solution that is macroscopically homogeneous and transparent, that is to say having a maximum light transmittance value, irrespective of the wavelength between 400 and 800 nm, through a sample 1 cm thick, of at least 85% and preferably of at least 90%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> These water-soluble units do not have a heat-induced demixing temperature of LCST type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> These water-soluble units may be obtained by free-radical polymerization of vinyl monomers, or by polycondensation, or alternatively may consist of natural polymers or modified existing natural polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> By way of example, mention may be made of the following monomers, which may be used to form the said water-soluble units, alone or as a mixture: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The water-soluble units preferably have a molar mass ranging from 1000 g/mol to 5 000 000 g/mol when they constitute the water-soluble backbone of a grafted polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> These water-soluble units preferably have a molar mass ranging from 500 g/mol to 100 000 g/mol when they constitute a block of a multiblock polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The units with an LCST of the polymers used in the invention may be defined as being units whose water solubility is modified beyond a certain temperature. They are units with a heat-induced demixing temperature (or cloud point) defining their region of solubility in water. The minimum demixing temperature obtained as a function of the polymer concentration is referred to as the &ldquo;LCST&rdquo; (Lower Critical Solution Temperature) . For each polymer concentration, a heat-induced demixing temperature is observed; it is higher than the LCST, which is the minimum point of the curve. Below this temperature, the polymer is soluble in water; above this temperature, the polymer loses its solubility in water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The expression &ldquo;soluble in water at a temperature T&rdquo; means that the units have a solubility at T of at least 1 g/l and preferably of at least 2 g/l. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The measurement of the LCST may be performed visually: the temperature at which the cloud point of the aqueous solution appears is determined; this cloud point is reflected by the opacification of the solution, or the loss of transparency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In general, a transparent composition will have a maximum light transmittance value, irrespective of the wavelength between 400 and 800 mm, through a sample 1 cm thick, of at least 85% and preferably of at least 90%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The transmittance may be measured by placing a sample 1 cm thick in the light beam of a spectrophotometer working at the wavelengths of the light spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The units with an LCST in the polymers used in the invention may consist of one or more of the following polymers: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> in which m is an integer ranging from 1 to 40 and preferably from 2 to 20, and n is an integer ranging from 10 to 60 and preferably from 20 to 50. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the molar mass of these units with an LCST is from 500 to 5300 g/mol and especially from 1500 to 4000 g/mol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It has been found that the random distribution of the EO and PO units is reflected by the existence of a lower critical demixing temperature, beyond which a macroscopic phase separation is observed. This behaviour is different from that of block (EO) (PO) copolymers, which form micelles beyond a critical temperature known as the micellization temperature (macroscopic aggregation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The units with an LCST may thus especially be derived from aminated, especially monoamino, diamino or triamino, random copolymers of ethylene oxide and of propylene oxide.

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As examples of polymeric and copolymeric N-substituted acrylamide derivatives having an LCST, mention may be made of poly-N-isopropylacrylamide, poly-N-ethylacrylamide and copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide (or of N-ethylacrylamide) and of a vinyl monomer having the formula (I) given above, or of a monomer chosen from maleic anhydride, itaconic acid, vinylpyrrolidone, styrene and its derivatives, dimethyldiallylammonium chloride, vinylacetamide, vinyl ethers and vinyl acetate derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The molar mass of these polymers is preferably from 1000 g/mol to 500 000 g/mol and preferably from 2000 to 50 000 g/mol. These polymers may be synthesized by free-radical polymerization using a pair of initiators such as aminoethanethiol hydrochloride, in the presence of potassium persulphate, so as to obtain precursor oligomers with a reactive amino end group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As examples of vinylcaprolactam copolymers, mention may be made of copolymers of vinylcaprolactam and of a vinyl monomer of formula (I) given above, or of a monomer chosen from maleic anhydride, itaconic acid, vinylpyrrolidone, styrene and its derivatives, dimethyldiallylammonium chloride, vinylacetamide, vinyl alcohol, vinyl acetate, vinyl ethers and vinyl acetate derivatives. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> These compounds may be synthesized by free-radical polymerization using a pair of initiators such as aminoethanethiol hydrochloride, in the presence of potassium persulphate, so as to obtain precursor oligomers with a reactive amino end group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The proportion by mass of units with an LCST in the final polymer is preferably from 5% to 70%, especially from 20% to 65% and particularly from 30% to 60% by weight relative to the final polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As defined above, the demixing temperature of the said units with an LCST is from 5&deg; C. to 40&deg; C. and preferably from 10&deg; C. to 35&deg; C., for a concentration in water of 1% by mass of the said units with an LCST. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The polymers used in the context of the invention may be readily prepared by a person skilled in the art on the basis of his general knowledge, using grafting, copolymerization or coupling reaction processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the final polymer is in the form of a grafted polymer, especially having a water-soluble backbone with LCST side chains, it is possible to prepare it by grafting units with an LCST containing at least one reactive end group, especially an amino end group, onto a water-soluble polymer forming the backbone, bearing at least 10% (on a molar basis) of reactive groups such as carboxylic acid functions. This reaction may be carried out in the presence of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, in a solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone or water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Another possibility for preparing grafted polymers consists in copolymerizing, for example, a macromonomer with an LCST (chain with an LCST described above with a vinyl end group) and a water-soluble vinyl monomer such as acrylic acid or vinyl monomers of formula (I). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When the final polymer is in the form of a block polymer, it is possible to prepare it by coupling between water-soluble units and units with an LCST, these units having complementary reactive sites at each end. </paragraph>

In this case, the reactive sites of the water-soluble units may be carboxylic acid functions. </paragraph>

In all cases, the stability of the dispersions is ensured by the presence of the polymer containing water-soluble units and units with an LCST described above. To ensure this stability, the concentration by mass of the polymer in the continuous aqueous phase of the oil-in-water emulsions and of the water-in-oil-in-water emulsions or of the multiphase compositions, is generally from 0.01% to 20% and preferably from 0.1% to 10%. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Polymer 2 thus makes it possible to improve the stability of the emulsion at 45&deg; C. when it is present in a low concentration by mass (0.8% by weight of the emulsion, i.e. 1% in aqueous phase). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The gelling power of Polymer 2 above 27&deg; C. thus makes it possible to improve the stability of the emulsion above this gel point, while at the same time maintaining a low viscosity at 20&deg; C.
