<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to range binoculars, more particularly to range binoculars that are easy to adjust the pupil distance and capable of indicating the distance between the binoculars and the object being observed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional range binoculars have a pair of lens barrels, one of which includes a left observation optical system and the other of which includes a right observation optical system, and a middle bridge to which each of the barrels is connected, wherein either of the barrels can turn around the middle bridge. When the user adjusts the pupil distance, s/he turns the lens barrels around the middle bridge so as to adjust the distance between the eyepieces to his/her pupil distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This adjustment means turning the whole optical axes of the observation optical systems around the middle bridge, which is accompanied by a deviation of the optical axes and undesirable influences on the electronic parts resulting from vibration caused by the turning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the methods of displaying a measured distance used in conventional range binoculars is directly placing an LCD showing the distance on the focal plane. Another method is brightly projecting the display of an LED onto the visual field with a relay lens using the beam splitter of an erecting prism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in the former method, because the light transmissibility of an LCD is very low, the image made by the observation optical system that also displays the distance is dark compared with the image made by the other observation optical system. As a result, the image the binoculars finally make is very obscure. On the other hand, the latter method does not lower the brightness of the image made by the observation optical system that also displays the distance. Also, the distance can be displayed at the center of the visual field. Consequently, the latter method does not make the image obscure. However, it makes the system of relays complicated and requires special LEDs, which results in an increase in production cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to remove the deficiencies conventional range binoculars have. Specifically, the objective of this invention is to provide a pair of range binoculars that, when the pupil distance is adjusted, is free from a deviation of the optical axes and undesirable influences on the electronic parts resulting from vibration caused by the adjustment. The objective pair of binoculars is also capable to show the measured distance in such a way as the user can see it easily without making the system complicated, and secures the brightness of the visual field where the measured distance is displayed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Main body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes laser emitter comprising laser diode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Laser diode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is placed in the vicinity of that wall in objective part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of main case <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is by the side of the first observation optical system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This laser diode emits an infrared ray perpendicularly to the optical axes of the first observation optical system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the second observation optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The wavelength of an infrared ray emitted by laser diode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be chosen at the designer&apos;s discretion, as long as the distance between the binoculars and the observed object can be measured by the method that will be explained hereafter. An example of the wavelength is 905 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is placed on the axis of the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in objective part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of main case <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The splitter reflects an infrared ray emitted by laser diode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and sends the collimated ray through the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to the outside of range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The splitter, on the other hand, transmits visible light coming into the optical path formed by the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> from the outside of range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and guides the visible light to the second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. A prism beam splitter that has the same or similar function as a plate beam splitter may be used in place of plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Each of the first objective optical system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is comprised of a group of objective lenses made of a combination of plural lenses. The groups of objective lenses are fixed in the first objective cylinder <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the second objective cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> respectively. These objective optical systems may be the same as those used in conventional binoculars or range binoculars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Each of the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is comprised of a group of ocular lenses made of a combination of plural lenses. As explained hereinbefore, the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is fixed in the first ocular cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted on ocular part <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of main case <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, while the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is fixed in the second ocular cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> mounted on attached case <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. These ocular optical systems may be the same as those used in conventional binoculars or range binoculars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is a known Porro II erecting prism made by a combination of the second upper prism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the second side prism <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the second lower prism <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is placed in such a position as a ray coming through the second objective optical system enters into the second upper prism <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the second side prism <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the second lower prism <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in this order and then is sent to the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Due to this structure of the second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the second observation optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of which optical axis is not in line with the optical axis of the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, similar to the structure of the second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the first optical member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> comprises a Porro II erecting prism made by a combination of the first upper prism <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the first side prism <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the first lower prism <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and further a rectangular prism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Rectangular prism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is set to the Porro II erecting prism with the bottom face thereof contacted with the bottom face of the first lower prism <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. This combination of the first lower prism <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> with rectangular prism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> makes a beam splitter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the first optical member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has, in addition to the same function as the second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> has, the function of a beam splitter, which transmits an infrared ray and reflects visible light. Due to these functions of the first optical member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, of an infrared ray that is emitted by the laser diode to the outside of range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, reflected and returned by the object, and comes into the optical path of the first observation optical system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the first object optical system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and visible light that is reflected by the object and comes into the optical path of the first observation optical system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the first object optical system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, only the visible light is reflected by beam splitter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and sent to the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, while the infrared ray is transmitted by beam splitter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and guided to the outside of the first observation optical system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Between the first optical member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the first observation optical system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed reticle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Reticle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided with a mill scale. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, measured distance displaying means <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is placed at a position above the optical axis of the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the position being off the optical path of the first observation optical system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of that part shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which includes measured distance displaying means <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, reticle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Measured distance displaying means <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> comprises LCD means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, connected with the range-finding means, for displaying the distance between the observer and the object measured by said range-finding means, and relay lens <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which comprise a displaying optical system for projecting the distance displayed by said LCD means on reticle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this application the abbreviation &ldquo;LCD&rdquo; means liquid crystal display. An image made by LCD means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is projected onto reticle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through relay lens <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and by reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be placed at a given position as long as it is within the visual field formed by the first ocular optical system. Preferably, the reflecting mirror should be placed at a rim of the visual field so that it does not obstruct the observed object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which has the aforementioned structural features, functions as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pupil distance is adjusted through the rotation of attached body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As mentioned hereinbefore and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the axis of annular projection <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in line with the optical axis of the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Consequently, when the second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are simultaneously turned through the rotation of attached body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, rays coming along the optical axis of the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> enter the second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> always by the same point. This means that the rotation of attached body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> does not change the image obtained in the second observation optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Also, since the optical axis of the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is not in line with the optical axis of the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, when attached body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated, the optical axis of the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> included in attached body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> turns, drawing a circular arc of which center is on the axis of the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and of which radius corresponds to the differential between the optical axis of the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and that of the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Since the optical axis of the second objective optical system exists in main case <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, separate from attached body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, together with the optical axis of the first objective optical system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and that of the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, when attached body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is rotated, the distance between the optical axis of the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and that of the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is not changed. In summary, when attached body is rotated, the distance between the optical axis of the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and that of the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is changed, which means the distance between the second ocular cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, accommodating the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the first ocular cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, accommodating the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the second ocular cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may take, for example, position a, b or c, by the rotation of attached body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this figure, the distance between the first ocular cylinder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the second ocular cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is the pupil distance, is smallest when the second ocular cylinder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> takes position a, and largest when position c. In this way, the pupil distance can be adjusted without affecting the visual field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The user can observe an object with range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the same way as with ordinary binoculars. When an object is observed with range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, visible light reflected by the object comes into the binoculars through the first objective optical system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The visible light coming into range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the first objective optical system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> proceeds along the optical path determined by the first objective optical system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and enters the first optical member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which has the function of a beam splitter. Since beam splitter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the first optical member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> reflects visible light as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the visible light is reflected by beam splitter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and sent to the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through the optical path determined by the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, the visible light coming into range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> proceeds along the optical path determined by the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Since plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> transmits visible light, the visible light travels through plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, advances through the second optical member <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and reaches the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> via the optical path determined by the second ocular optical system <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In this way, the same image of the object can be made by each of the left and right optical systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The measurement of the distance between the observer and an object with range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is carried out in the following way. First, the object is brought into focus. Then, plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is irradiated with an infrared ray produced by laser diode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Since plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> reflects infrared rays as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the infrared ray emitted by laser diode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is reflected by plate beam splitter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and sent to the object through the second objective optical system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The infrared ray is reflected by the object and sent into range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the first objective optical system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The incoming infrared ray proceeds along the path determined by the first objective optical system and enters the first optical member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which has a beam splitting function. Since infrared rays travel through beam splitter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the first optical member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the infrared ray is transmitted by beam splitter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and guided to the outside of the first observation optical system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Then, the infrared ray is received and detected with laser beam receiver <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The distance between the observing point and the object is calculated based on the length of time from the emission by laser diode <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the detection with laser beam receiver <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When the calculation is finished, a signal indicating the distance is sent to LCD means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> included in measured distance displaying means <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, whereby the distance is displayed by LCD means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The image, which was produced by LCD means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and indicates the distance, is sent to reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through relay lens <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, reflected by reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and guided to the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is placed at a position near a rim of the visual field made by the first ocular optical system <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which results in a distance display without interfering with the observation of an object. Also, since the distance display method of range binoculars <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not mar at all the visual field other than the distance displaying part with reflecting mirror <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the image made by the first observation optical system, which also shows the distance, is not darkened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Further, from the distance calculated in the above-mentioned method and the indication of the mill scale fixed to reticle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be calculated the size of the object that is observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Hereinbefore has been explained one example of this invention. Needless to say, the invention is not limited to this example only but can be worked with suitable modification to the shape and structure unless it departs from the essential requirements of the invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Since the first observation optical system and the second observation optical system of the range binoculars in accordance with this invention are accommodated in one case, the positional relationship between these optical systems is not changed when the pupil distance is adjusted, which means pupil distance adjustment does not cause a deviation of the optical axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The pupil distance of the range binoculars in accordance with this invention is adjusted through the rotation of the attached body. Therefore accommodating such electronic parts as a laser diode or laser beam receiver in the main case can reduce harmful influences of that vibration on these electronic parts which is caused by the rotation for pupil distance adjustment. This feature makes possible a reliable measurement of the distance between the observer and the object being observed. Also, the electronic parts can be placed along one inner wall of the main case, which makes the adjustment of the parts easy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Since ordinary LCDs and simple relays can be used for the distance display, the production cost of the range binoculars in accordance with the invention can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The range binoculars of this invention can provide an image which is the same as or similar to that made by an ordinary binoculars other than the distanced is play part. In other words, the range binoculars do not have such defect as the image is not clearly seen because, for example, the image is darkened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Further, by providing the reticle with a mill scale, the size of an object being observed can be calculated from the distance measured and the indication of the mill scale. </paragraph>
