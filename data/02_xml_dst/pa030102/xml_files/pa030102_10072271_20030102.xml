<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to delivery of respiratory gases particularly though not solely to patient interfaces for providing gases to patients requiring respiratory therapy. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the art of respiration devices, there are well known a variety of respiratory masks which cover the nose and/or mouth of a human user in order to provide a continuous seal around the nasal and/or oral areas of the face such that gas may be provided at positive pressure within the mask for consumption by the user. The uses for such masks range from high altitude breathing (i.e., aviation applications) to mining and fire fighting applications, to various medical diagnostic and therapeutic applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One requisite of such respiratory masks has been that they provide an effective seal against the user&apos;s face to prevent leakage of the gas being supplied. Commonly, in prior mask configurations, a good mask-to-face seal has been attained in many instances only with considerable discomfort for the user. This problem is most crucial in those applications, especially medical applications, which require the user to wear such a mask continuously for hours or perhaps even days. In such situations, the user will not tolerate the mask for long durations and optimum therapeutic or diagnostic objectives thus will not be achieved, or will be achieved with great difficulty and considerable user discomfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In common with prior art designs, is an inability to seal effectively when the user&apos;s face becomes distorted. For example, as shown in the prior art mask of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> when the user <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is sleeping on his or her side, one side <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the headgear tends to be pulled tight while the other side <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> tends to be loose. This causes the axis of the mask <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to be twisted with respect to the axis of the head <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>&mdash;due to the net torque from the headgear&mdash;resulting in leakage <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> on one side. The user <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> sleeping on his or her side may also distort the facial contours around the nasal area <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and may lead to further leakage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides improvements in the field of patient interfaces for use in respiratory therapy. In particular an interface is described which is more comfortable for the user to wear and reduces the side leakage as compared with interfaces of the prior art. It will be appreciated that while a mask is described in the preferred embodiment, the present invention can be used in respiratory care generally or with a ventilator but will now be described below with reference to use in a humidified CPAP system. It will be appreciated the present invention could equally be used with any form of positive pressure respiratory therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 a</cross-reference> humidified Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) system is shown in which a patient <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is receiving humidified and pressurised gases through a nasal mask <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to a humidified gases transportation pathway or inspiratory conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that delivery systems could also be VPAP (Variable Positive Airway Pressure) and BiPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) or numerous other forms of respiratory therapy. Inspiratory conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to the outlet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of a humidification chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which contains a volume of water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Inspiratory conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may contain heating means or heater wires (not shown) which heat the walls of the conduit to reduce condensation of humidified gases within the conduit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Humidification chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is preferably formed from a plastics material and may have a highly heat conductive base (for example an aluminium base) which is in direct contact with a heater plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of humidifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Humidifier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is provided with control means or electronic controller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which may comprise a microprocessor based controller executing computer software commands stored in associated memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> receives input from sources such as user input means or dial <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through which a user of the device may, for example, set a predetermined required value (preset value) of humidity or temperature of the gases supplied to patient <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The controller may also receive input from other sources, for example temperature and/or flow velocity sensors <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through connector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and heater plate temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In response to the user set humidity or temperature value input via dial <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the other inputs, controller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> determines when (or to what level) to energise heater plate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to heat the water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within humidification chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As the volume of water <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> within humidification chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is heated, water vapour begins to fill the volume of the chamber above the water&apos;s surface and is passed out of the humidification chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> outlet <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with the flow of gases (for example air) provided from a gases supply means or blower <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which enters the chamber through inlet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Exhaled gases from the patient&apos;s <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> mouth are passed directly to ambient surroundings in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Blower <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided with variable pressure regulating means or variable speed fan <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which draws air or other gases through blower inlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The speed of variable speed fan <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is controlled by electronic controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (or alternatively the function of controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> could carried out by controller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) in response to inputs from controller <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and a user set predetermined required value (preset value) of pressure or fan speed via dial <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Nasal Mask </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> the nasal mask, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, is shown in detail. The mask includes a hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with an inlet <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> connected to the inspiratory conduit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The mask <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is positioned around the nose of the user <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> secured around the back of the head of the patient <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The restraining force from the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the forehead rest <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> ensures enough compressive force on the mask cushion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, to provide an effective seal against the patient&apos;s face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is constructed of a relatively inflexible material for example, polycarbonate plastic. Such a material would provide the requisite rigidity as well as being transparent and a relatively good insulator. The expiratory gases can be expelled through a valve (not shown) in the mask, a further expiratory conduit (not shown), or any other such method as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Mask Headgear </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is shown connected to the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Rather than traditional fixed or adjustable attachments the present invention utilises a sliding engagement between the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This is achieved in one embodiment with a loop <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, running through harnessing clips <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on either side of the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and over the top of the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The loop <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is reciprocally engaged with guides <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> mounted on the top surface of the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The guides constrain the loop <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> but allow it to slide in and out, meaning the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can move laterally, independently of the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The advantage to this is as the face is contorted during various sleeping positions the headgear is able to move with the changes in position while the mask is left in the correct position on the nose of the user and an effective seal is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Additional guides <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> allow the user to adjust position of loop <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, giving ability to get different pressure on the seal depending on loop <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> To further ensure user comfort and effective pressure on the mask cushion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be constructed either using two straps running around the back of the user&apos;s head as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> or with a partial skull cap or any other configurations as are known in the art. In this case the straps or partial skull cap would be constructed using neoprene but may also be constructed using any material as is known in the art which will be comfortable for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> the present invention is illustrated using a sliding strap to attach the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The strap <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> in isolation, is constructed of polyacetal (Delrin 500P NC010) using injection moulding techniques to give a polished finish. This material, similar to other nylon based derivatives, with its polished finish has a particularly low friction co-efficient, and therefore slides with respect to the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with very little resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the hollow body <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes a number of engaging clips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, in use the sliding strap <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> snaps into place into the engaging clips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and can only be removed therefrom using a substantial force. This means that with any normal use the sliding strap <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will stay retained within the engaging clips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. It will also be appreciated from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> that a number of clips are so provided, in order to allow pressure from different angles for different face shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> the sliding strap includes a mid-section <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> intended to reciprocate with the engaging clips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, terminated at each end by loops <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> which attach to the headgear. The first loop <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is a full loop through which the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is permanently attached with for example, a velcro strap. The loop <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> at the other end, is only a partial loop <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> designed so that a strap or loop from the headgear <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be easily slipped in or out of the open section <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to allow easy removal and attachment of the mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In a further alternative the sliding loop or strap could form a continuous portion of the headgear. Other variations of the sliding connection are possible, for example a clip or knob in the loop or strap could slide withing slots in the mask body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that in all embodiments of the present invention the attachment from the headgear to the mask is designed to slide with the lowest possible friction while still ensuring adequate direct force on the mask cushion to the user&apos;s face. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the sliding connection <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the present invention allows the headgear <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to provide even force on both sides of the mask <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. This avoids placing a torque on the mask and consequent mask twisting, which minimises mask leaks from the seal to the face <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Nasal Cannula </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the present invention may be equally applied to any patient interface for delivery gases to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring now particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> we see that a nasal cannula <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is secured at its base to the back of a neonates head using strap <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight>. The strap connects at the base of the neonates skull on the back of the neck. It connects to the cannula <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> by way of a sliding strap <highlight><bold>1152</bold></highlight>. This strap is secured by way of clips to the hard plastic body <highlight><bold>1138</bold></highlight> allowing the securing strap <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight> substantial relative movement with respect to the cannula <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> as the neonate twists its head while providing adequate restraining force directly on the cannula <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> without any twisting of the cannula <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment this is accomplished by a plastic e.g. acetal sliding strap which engages into sliding clips on the outer face of the cannula. The Teflon strap is adjustably attached to the neck strap <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to allow the tension to be adjusted to a comfortable level. Alternatively a sliding loop could be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Full Face Mask </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> a number of further embodiments are illustrated particularly relating to fill face masks. Similarly to the preceding embodiments in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> the mask <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is attached to headgear around the head of a patient with a sliding Teflon strap <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. The strap engages through a channel <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> moulded into the mask <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Alternatively as seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> the mask <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> is attached to the headgear with a sliding loop <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. The loop engages with the headgear through Velcro loops <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> and to the mask <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> through clips <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Mouthpiece </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> a mouthpiece <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> is shown employing embodiments of the present invention. The mouthpiece <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> engages with sliding strap <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> through a channel through the inlet <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> of the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>. Again as with the preceding embodiments the strap <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight> engages to the headgear through clips <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight> at each end. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> two straps <highlight><bold>1408</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight> attach to the mouthpiece <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> either side of the inlet <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> in a further alternative. The mouthpiece employed could otherwise be as described in our European Patent Application No. <highlight><bold>1163924</bold></highlight> or other mouthpieces as would be contemplated by one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that numerous other interfaces for example E.T (endrotraceal) tubes might also be used in conjunction with the present invention. </paragraph>
