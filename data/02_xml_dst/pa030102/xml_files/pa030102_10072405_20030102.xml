<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a device used in performing a process in a process medium by varying the parameters of said process medium, and more particularly, a device for controlling a temperature change of a process medium during the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Chemists working in a laboratory scale within different areas need means to control and accurately follow reactions in a process medium, for example, a solution. Ordinary means of decreasing the temperature in, for example, a solution has been to place the beaker containing the solution, wherein reactions are taking place, in an ice-bath, for example, thereby causing the temperature to be lowered. This does lead to a temperature decrease. However, it is not possible to follow the reactions, for example a crystallization of the solution, accurately and precisely. It is also difficult in these cases in a laboratory scale to obtain results which can be reproduced. In certain research areas, there would be considerable advantages if the chemist could accurately and precisely follow a reaction over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the Swedish patent SE 9203388-5, a device for keeping the temperature constant in a solution in a laboratory scale is described, said device being characterized by that of a cooling unit comprising a peltiere element that has been combined with a magnetic stirrer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Within the art, there is a considerable need of a device for controlling processes accurately in a laboratory scale. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying Figures, wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout. The terminology used in the description presented herein is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner in accordance with its ordinary use in the art and in accordance with any overt definitions provided below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a device for accurately controlling the temperature of a solution during a process. Preferably, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enables a user to repeatedly reproduce the same results due to the precise control of the parameters of the process medium. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contains a heat transfer plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The heat transfer plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a plate capable of transferring heat or cold, and is preferably a metal plate, and more preferably a gilded brass plate. The plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contains an internal digital temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (such as model no. DS 1820, available from Dallas Inc., USA). An upper side of the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is intended to be in contact with a bottom surface of a reaction receptacle (not shown), such as a beaker containing a sample solution. A lower side of the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in contact with a peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the present disclosure, the expression reaction receptacle is meant to include any kind of vessel suited for the desirable heating or cooling transfer from the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the receptacle containing the solution. The peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also in contact with a cooling flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing a centrally provided motor, on the axis of which a magnetic stirrer is fixed. The polarity of the current flowing through the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> used in the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention may be changed, causing both heat and cold to be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is located below the cooling flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (such as the Basic Stamp <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, available from Parallax Inc., USA) regulates various functions, such as: activating the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to either heat or cool the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby tempering the solution within the beaker; activating the fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to pass away the cold or heat generated by the cooling flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; regulating the number of revolutions (rpm) of the motor and thereby also the rpm of said magnet causing the rpm of the magnetic stirrer located in said beaker to be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A support unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (such as model no. PIC12C671, available from Microchip Inc., USA) collects data from an external digital temperature sensor (such as model no. DS1820, available from Dallas Inc., USA) which provides an additional, and preferably, a better illustration of the actual temperature of the solution compared to if only the internal digital temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used. The support unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> mediates only temperature data from the external temperature sensor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> if it is connected, otherwise the temperature data of the internal digital temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is mediated to the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. If the support unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> registers that the temperature of the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is greater than the maximum allowed values according to the manufacturer of the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a signal is sent to the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> presents the actual settings and values on a display <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Parameters such as start and stop temperature value, size of the temperature variation over time, and stirring rate are entered on a keyboard <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and then a computer program in the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is responsible to enable the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to achieve the adjusted values. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can collect or send information to a network or other computer by way of a serial interface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> stores information as to the appropriate variation of the parameters over time, such as a predetermined scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the invention, the internal digital temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or the external temperature sensor are immersed in the process medium. The internal digital temperature sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be a part of the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in response to the output signal from the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is adapted to heat or cool the metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with which it is in contact. In another embodiment, one side of said peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in contact with the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the other side is in contact with the cooling flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the invention, the computer program, when processed, further performs the step of sending a second output signal to the fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In still a further embodiment of the invention, the computer program, when processed, further sends a third output signal to a motor controlling the number of revolutions of the magnetic stirrer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> further comprises units such as a program memory, a working memory and a processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The predetermined scheme according to which the parameters, preferably the temperature, of the solution are to follow is set by a user. The predetermined scheme usually contains a start value and a stop value. The rate at which the parameters of the solution, preferably the temperature, are to increase or decrease from the start value and stop value, respectively, over time is also determined by the user and depending naturally on the conditions of the chemical process. The parameters of the solution, preferably the temperature, will follow the predetermined scheme in response to the output signals from the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in turn responding to the input signals from the temperature-sensing means. The user desiring to follow and observe the accuracy of a chemical process will set both a start set value, a stop set value and a rate (&deg; C./min) at which the chemical process is to follow from the start set value to the stop set value. The rate (&deg; C./min) may be rising or falling from the start value to the stop set value and depends on the conditions of the chemical process. Thus, the predetermined scheme can be regarded as the temperature as a function of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the present disclosure, the expression &ldquo;real value&rdquo; means the actual value obtained in the process, i.e., the real temperature of the process medium measured with temperature-sensing means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The variation of the temperature over time may be in the interval from 0.001&deg; C./minute to 10&deg; C./minute, or more, depending naturally on the process the user wants to follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention is a method to vary the temperature of the solution. In a first step, the temperature of a solution is measured by a temperature-sensing means and sending an input signal, real value, to the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> compares the input signal with the predetermined scheme, set value. If there is a difference between real value and set value, the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> sends an output signal to the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, whereby the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in response to the output signal heats or cools the metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with which it is in contact. The plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being heated or cooled in the previous step above is directly or indirectly in contact with the reaction receptacle containing the solution. The fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may also be activated by an output signal from the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in order to conduct away the heat or cold generated. Stirring means may also be regulated in response to an output signal from the data processing unit <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in order to either increase or decrease the number of revolutions of the magnetic stirrer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, one side of the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in contact with the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the other side is in contact with the cooling flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, whereby the cooling flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in contact with a fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is intended to be used for passing away generated heat or cold from the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and cooling flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In some sensitive chemical reactions, the temperature variation needs to be controlled very accurately whereby the stirring of the solution is important and is effected with the magnetic stirrer. The stirrer allows the solution to have a substantially homogeneous temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The variation of the temperature over time in the solution can be an increase or decrease of the temperature within the range of 0.001-10&deg; C./min., or more. The chosen variation over time depends on the chemical reaction and on the different conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Different applications of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention include, but are not necessarily limited to, crystallization and precipitation of inorganic materials, organic polymers and biochemical substances, enantiomeric selective precipitation of a D-form or L-form of an enantiomer of a substance, selective dissolution at different temperatures of components in a substance in order to remove undesirable agents, controlled and delicate dissolution of temperature-sensitive substances in need of heating in connection with dissolution, controlled and delicate melting of inorganic, organic and biochemical substances. Other applications within the field of biotechnology include, but are not necessarily limited to, controlled temperature cycling of enzymatic reactions, controlled temperature cycling of DNA or RNA hybridization reactions, kinetic studies of the effect of the temperature on chemical reactions, enzymatic reactions, complex formation reactions and DNA/RNA hybridization reactions, temperature regulation of chemical and enzymatic reactions by reactants or products which may be activated or deactivated by a controlled temperature change of the reaction mixture. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention may be used in any other application, wherein the control of the temperature is needed and is of substantial value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The computer program stored in the memory media controls at least the following functions of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>: the size of the variation of the temperature over time, start and stop temperature set value, regulation of the starting of the electrical fan <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, overheating control of the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and control of the rpm of the magnetic stirrer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Further, the computer program follows the actual temperature of the process medium measured by the temperature-sensing means as a function of time and controls the starting of and polarity of the peltiere element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The control occurs so that the process medium is cooled or heated depending on if its temperature differs from the predetermined temperature scheme which is to be maintained from the start temperature set value to the stop set temperature value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention has many advantages in a laboratory scale. By varying the temperature over time accurately in a process medium containing different chemical species, it is possible to obtain a selective dissolution of each species present. This is an important tool, for example, when impurities are to be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Another important advantage obtained is in connection with chemical, biological or enzymatic reactions where reactants or products may be activated or deactivated by a controlled temperature change of the reaction mixture used on the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A further advantage is the increased yield of a substance such as crystals that may be obtained by the precise control of the parameters by the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an example where a beaker containing 80 ml water, under stirring (250 rpm), has been placed on the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the invention. From the graph, it can be concluded that the temperature of said solution has been lowered from 25.0&deg; C. to 15.0&deg; C. with a decrease of the temperature over time of 0.43&deg; C./minute, thereafter kept constant at the latter temperature. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an example where the start set value has been set at 40&deg; C., the stop set value at 5&deg; C. and the decrease of the temperature over time set at 1&deg; C./minute. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> This example describes a purification process by re-crystallization of a substance, via aspartic acid, being contaminated with 5% NaCl. Firstly, the contaminated substance (0.33 g) and water (50 ml) is added to a flat bottom beaker (100 ml) and is placed on a device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. Thereafter, the temperature of the solution is raised to 40.0&deg; C. and the substance is dissolved under stirring (rpm&equals;250) during 1 hour. Thereafter, a controlled temperature decrease is started with 1&deg; C./minute according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. When the solution has reached the temperature of 5.0&deg; C., see indication A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, small crystals become visible. The temperature of the solution is allowed to stabilize at 4.0&deg; C. and the solution is allowed to stand overnight while stirring (rpm&equals;10). Finally, the solution containing a white precipitate is filtered, the result being a white powder consisting of pure crystals of aspartic acid. </paragraph>
