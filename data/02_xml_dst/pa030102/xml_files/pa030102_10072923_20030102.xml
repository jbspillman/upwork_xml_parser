</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a positive electrode for a rechargeable lithium battery and a method of preparing the same, and more particularly, to a positive electrode for a rechargeable lithium battery having improved capacity, power, and cycle-life characteristics, and a method of preparing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Rechargeable lithium batteries use a material from or into which lithium ions are deintercalated or intercalated for positive and negative active materials. A lithium salt solution in an organic solvent or a polymer is used as an electrolyte. Rechargeable lithium batteries produce electric energy as a result of changes in the chemical potentials of the active materials during the intercalation and deintercalation reactions of the lithium ions. A rechargeable lithium battery having an average discharge voltage of approximately 3.7 V is considered to be one of the essential components in the digital generation since it is an indispensable energy source for portable digital devices, such as cellular phones, notebook computers, and camcorders (i.e., the so called &ldquo;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C&rdquo; devices). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For the negative active material in the rechargeable lithium battery, metallic lithium was used in the early days of development. Recently, however, since the metallic lithium causes problems such as a short life due to a high reactivity toward the electrolyte and the formation of lithium dendrites, carbon materials, such as amorphous carbon or crystalline carbon based materials, which reversibly intercalate lithium ions, are extensively used instead of the metallic lithium. With the use of carbon-based active materials, the battery performance has been improved tremendously. The short life and safety problems due to the metallic lithium has been prevented, relatively high energy density of the battery has been achieved, and cycle-life characteristics are also improved. It has also been suggested to add additives, such as boron, to the carbonaceous material, especially, by coating. For example, a boron-coated graphite (BOC) improves the performance characteristics of the carbonaceous materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For the positive active material in the rechargeable lithium battery, chalcogenide compounds into or from which lithium ions are intercalated or deintercalated are used. Typical examples thereof include LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiMn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, LiNiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiNi<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>Co<highlight><subscript>X</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(0&lt;x&lt;1), and LiMnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. A manganese-based positive active material, such as LiMn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or LiMnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, is readily prepared, is less expensive than the other materials, and is environmentally friendly. However, the manganese-based materials have a disadvantage of a relatively low capacity. LiNiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is inexpensive and has a high capacity, but is difficult to prepare in the desired structure. Among these materials, LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the most accepted in the battery market since its overall performance characteristics are better than the others. Accordingly, most of the current commercially available rechargeable lithium batteries (approximately 95%) use LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as the positive active material, but it is rather expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is a great deal of effort being exerted to find an alternative thereof in order to reduce the cost of the active material. For example, in U. S. Pat. No. 5,292,601, Li<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>MO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(wherein M is an element selected from Co, Ni, or Mn; x is 0.5-1) is suggested as an alternative to LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a positive active material. U. S. Pat. No. 5,705,291 also discloses a method of fabricating a rechargeable lithiated intercalation battery including the operations of mixing a coating composition including boron oxide, boric acid, lithium hydroxide, aluminum oxide, lithium aluminate, lithium metaborate, silicon dioxide, lithium silicate, or mixtures thereof with a lithiated intercalation compound particulate, and fusing the coating compound at a temperature in excess of about 400&deg; C. so as to coat the particulate with the fused coating compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, there are continuing demands for further improved positive active materials especially for improvements in power and cycle-life characteristics. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A slurry of the positive active material composition of an embodiment of the present invention is prepared by suspending and dissolving the positive active material and a binder, respectively, in a solvent. The solvent includes any conventional solvent used for the conventional positive active material composition, such as N-methyl pyrrolidone. The contents of the solvent and the positive active material are not critical in the present invention, but should be sufficient to provide a suitable viscosity so that the composition is readily coated on the current collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The binder includes any conventional binder used for a conventional positive active material composition as long as the binder is soluble in the solvent used. An example of a binder includes polyvinylidene fluoride. While not required in all embodiments, the composition further includes a conductive agent to enhance conductivity of the battery. The conductive agent includes any conventional conductive agent that improves the conductivity of the positive active material composition, such as carbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The current collector that carries the positive active material composition may be made of any inert electrically conductive material, such as any metal that is reasonably inert in the battery cell environment. A representative example thereof is an Al-foil current collector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the current collector coated with the positive active material layer is treated with a coating liquid. The coating liquid includes a coating-element source. The coating process according to embodiment of the invention includes one of by a dipping method and a vacuum impregnation method. The dipping method includes the operations of dipping the active material-coated current collector in the coating liquid, removing the dipped current collector from the coating liquid, and drying the removed current collector. The vacuum impregnation method involves impregnation of the coating solution into pores in the active material composition of the coated current collector in a reduced pressure or vacuum environment in order to improve penetration of the coating solution into the pores. Generally, a dip coating method is used since it is the simplest method, but it is understood that the vacuum impregnation method or other methods would be useful in other embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By the above method, the layer of the positive active material is impregnated with the coating liquid so that the positive active material in the bulk of the layer as well as the positive active material at a surface of the layer is coated with the coating liquid. When adopting the dip-coating method according to an embodiment of the invention, the active material coated current collector is immersed in the coating liquid for 16 to 24 hours so that a suitable thickness, generally at or between 1 and 100 nm, of the surface-treatment layer can be obtained. Within this range of thickness, the lithium ions of the current collector can be readily intercalated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The coating liquid is prepared by adding a coating-element source to a solvent to form a solution or a suspension according to an embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The solvent includes an organic solvent or water. The coating-element source includes any coating-element or any coating-element-included compound soluble in the solvent. The coating element generally includes Mg, Al, Co, K, Na, Ca, Si, Ti, V, Sn, Ge, B, As, or Zr according to an embodiment of the invention, and preferably, one of Al and B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The coating-element source includes the coating-element, a coating-element-included alkoxide, a coating-element-included salt, or a coating-element-included oxide according to embodiments of the invention. Since the solubility of the coating-element source largely depends upon the type of solvent used, one having ordinary skill in the art can easily choose a suitable coating-element source from the group consisting of the coating element itself, the coating-element-included alkoxide, the coating-element-included salt, or the coating-element-included oxide by considering the type of solvent. For example, the organic solvent is used as the solvent for the coating liquid, the coating element, the coating-element-included alkoxide, the coating-element-included salt, or the coating-element-included oxide may be chosen such that it is dissolved in the organic solvent, using a refluxed method, if necessary. Alternatively, if water is used as the solvent, either the coating-element-included salt or the coating-element-included oxide may be used to prepare the coating liquid. For an example of the coating-element source according to embodiments of the invention, tetraethyl orthosilicate is used as a silicone source, whereas B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>BO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, or HB(OH)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is used as a boron source, wherein HB(OH)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is prepared by dissolving B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in an organic solvent or water followed by drying. When vanadium is used as a coating-element according to an embodiment of the invention, vanadium oxide (V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>) or a vanadate such as ammonium vanadate (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>(VO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Examples of the organic solvent include, but are not limited to, an alcohol (such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol), hexane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, ether, methylene chloride, and acetone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A concentration of the coating-element source is roughly at or between 0.1 and 50 wt % of the coating solution according to an embodiment of the invention. Preferably, the concentration is at or between 0.1 and 20 wt % of the coating solution. In a case when the concentration thereof is below 0.1 wt %, coating is not fully effective, whereas in a case when the concentration of the coating element source is more than 50 wt %, the thickness of the resultant coating layer is thicker than desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Subsequent to the wet coating, the resultant current collect or with the active material layer is dried to form a positive electrode for a rechargeable lithium battery. The drying process is performed in the temperature range at or between room ambient temperature and 200&deg; C. for 1 to 20 hours. If the drying temperature is lower than room temperature, the drying time is unduly long, and if the drying temperature is higher than 200&deg; C., the desired surface-treatment layer is not obtained. If the drying duration is shorter than 1 hour, the electrode is dried insufficiently, while if it is longer than 20 hours, the process time is undesirably long. However, it is understood that other drying temperatures and times may be useful according to a need. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> During the drying process, the coating liquid is dried and converted to a coating-element-included hydroxide, a coating-element-included oxyhydroxide, a coating-element-included oxycarbonate, a coating-element-included hydroxycarbonate, or a mixture thereof. The dried coating layer forms an amorphous or a crystalline surface-treatment layer at a surface as well as in the bulk of the positive active material layer. Depending on the processing conditions, the surface-treatment layer contains various mixed compositions of a coating-element-included hydroxide, a coating-element-included oxyhydroxide, a coating-element-included oxycarbonate, and a coating-element-included hydroxycarbonate. For example, if the drying process is performed under carbon dioxide (CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), the surface-treatment layer may predominantly contain the coating-element-included oxycarbonate or the coating-element-included hydroxycarbonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Since the surface-treatment layer may reduce the interfacial resistance between the electrolyte and the active material, the polarization drop of the discharge voltage and the over-voltage on charge, especially at high charge rates (C-rates), will be reduced. Therefore, the present invention is expected to provide a battery having improved power due to improved discharging-voltage characteristics. Such improved characteristics, in turn, will improve battery capacity as well as cycle life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As a result of the present invention, an addition of a simple treating operation with a coating liquid to the state-of-the-art positive electrode preparation process, improves the resultant battery performance substantially and significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A rechargeable lithium battery having a positive electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> manufactured by the above-mentioned method according to an embodiment of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The positive electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> contains a current collector, a layer of a positive active material coated on a surface on the current collector, and a surface-treatment layer applied to or impregnated in the layer of the positive active material. The surface-treatment layer includes a coating-element-included hydroxide, a coating-element-included oxyhydroxide, a coating-element-included oxycarbonate, a coating-element-included hydroxycarbonate, or a mixture thereof. A thickness of the surface-treatment layer is 1 to 100 nm. If the thickness is less than 1 nm, the effect of the surface-treatment layer on the battery performance is insignificant, whereas if it is more than 100 nm, the thickness is too thick for facilitating the movement of Li<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> ions through the coating layer and improving the battery performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The lithium battery further includes a case <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> containing the positive electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a lithium counter electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and a separator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> interposed between the positive electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the lithium counter electrode <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. However, it is understood that other lithium batteries can be constructed using the positive electrode <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The lithiated compounds represented by the formulas 1 to 13 may be commercially purchased or prepared by one of the following methods according to embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Lithium sources are mixed with metal sources in a desirable equivalent ratio. The lithium source includes any lithium salt, examples of which are lithium nitrate, lithium acetate, and lithium hydroxide. The metal sources include manganese sources, cobalt sources, nickel sources, or nickel-manganese sources. Typical examples of the manganese sources are manganese acetate, manganese nitrate, manganese chloride, manganese hydroxide, and manganese dioxide. Typical examples of the cobalt sources are cobalt oxide, cobalt nitrate, cobalt acetate, cobalt chloride, cobalt hydroxide, and cobalt carbonate, whereas typical examples of the nickel sources are nickel hydroxide, nickel nitrate, nickel chloride, nickel oxide, and nickel acetate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The nickel-manganese sources are produced by co-precipitating nickel and manganese salts, but can be produced according to other processes. Fluoride sources, sulfur sources, or phosphorous sources are used in addition to the manganese sources, cobalt sources, nickel sources, or nickel-manganese sources according to an embodiment, but need not be used in all circumstances. The fluoride sources may be manganese fluoride or lithium fluoride, and the sulfur sources may be manganese sulfide or lithium sulfide. The phosphorous source is a source such as H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. It should be noted that the above lists of manganese, cobalt, nickel, nickel-manganese, fluoride, sulfur, and phosphorus sources are examples and are not intended to limit the present invention thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate the reaction of the lithium sources and the metal sources, a small amount of solvent such as ethanol, methanol, water, or acetone is added to the mixture according to an embodiment of the invention. The mixture is then subjected to mortar grinding until the liquid form of solvent disappears visibly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The resulting mixture is heat-treated at about 400 to 600&deg; C. to produce a semi-crystalline precursor powder of positive active material compounds represented by formulas 1 to 13. If the heat-treating temperature is less than 400&deg; C., the metal sources may not react sufficiently with the lithium sources. After drying or heat-treating the precursor powder, the powder of the heat-treated active material precursor is remixed thoroughly while blowing dry air thereon to improve powder uniformity, but need not be remixed in all aspects of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The powder of the semi-crystalline precursor is heat-treated (the second heat-treating operation) again at about 700 to 900&deg; C. for about 10 to 15 hours to produce a powder of a crystalline positive active material. If the second heat-treating temperature is below 700&deg; C., conversion of the precursor to a crystalline material may not be sufficient. According to an embodiment of the invention, the heating operation is performed by increasing the temperature at the rate of 1 to 5&deg; C. /min while blowing dry air or oxygen through the mixture. The mixture is allowed to stand at the first and second heat-treating temperature for a predetermined period of time, respectively, after which the mixture is passively cooled. </paragraph>
