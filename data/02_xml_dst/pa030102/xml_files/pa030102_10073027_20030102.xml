<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a dialyzing apparatus which can quickly remove water from blood of a patient who may have arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art Statement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There is known a dialyzing apparatus which artificially removes, by utilizing osmotic-pressure difference or ultrafiltration, urea, uric acid, or creatinine, together with water, from blood of a patient. When the dialyzing apparatus is used, a patient whose blood circulates through the apparatus, and a doctor who attends to the patient cannot move away from the apparatus, for at least several hours. Therefore, it is desired to increase the water-remove rate and thereby quickly finish the dialysis operation. However, if the water-remove rate is excessively high, the patient may fall in a shock. To avoid this, an appropriate water-remove rate is manually set to obtain a target water amount to be removed for a dialysis duration of from 4 to 5 hours, in view of a standard body weight and a measured body weight of the patient and a water-remove capacity. The water-remove rate is defined as an amount of fluid that penetrates per unit time from the blood of the patient into the dialyzing fluid present in the dialyzer through the dialysis membrane, and the amount of fluid can be changed by changing a pressure difference over the dialysis membrane, e.g., a rotation speed of a negative-pressure pump which produces the pressure difference over the dialysis membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, softness of arteries of a patient who has arteriosclerosis is low and accordingly, during a dialysis operation, blood pressure of the patient may abruptly decrease and fall in a shock. However, since it has been a conventional practice to set a water-remove rate irrespective of whether a patient has arteriosclerosis, there have been a considerably large number of cases where a patient who has arteriosclerosis fall in a shock during a dialysis operation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a dialyzing apparatus which can prevent a patient who may have arteriosclerosis, from falling in a shock during a dialysis operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above objects have been achieved by the present invention. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dialyzing apparatus comprising a dialyzer which removes water from blood of a patient at a water-remove rate; an arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining device which obtains arteriosclerosis-related information that is related to a degree of arteriosclerosis of the patient; and a water-remove-rate display device which displays a target value of the water-remove rate based on the arteriosclerosis-related information obtained by the arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Since the water-remove-rate display device displays the target value of the water-remove rate based on the arteriosclerosis-related information of the patient, a patient who may have arteriosclerosis can be prevented from falling in a shock during a dialysis operation, if the target water-remove rate displayed by the display device is set on the dialyzing apparatus. Thus, water can be quickly removed from blood of a patient who may have arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred feature of the first aspect of the present invention, the dialyzing apparatus further comprises a target-water-remove-rate determining means for determining the target value of the water-remove rate based on the arteriosclerosis-related information obtained by the arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining device, and the water-remove-rate display device displays the target value of the water-remove rate determined by the target-water-remove-rate determining means. If the target water-remove rate displayed by the display device is set on the dialyzing apparatus, a patient who may have arteriosclerosis can be prevented from falling in a shock during a dialysis operation. Thus, water can be quickly removed from blood of a patient who may have arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred feature of the first aspect of the present invention, the target-water-remove-rate determining means determines a target water-remove rate range based on the arteriosclerosis-related information of the patient and a standard body weight and an actual body weight of the patient, and the water-remove-rate display device displays the determined target water-remove rate range. Preferably, the target-water-remove-rate determining means determines a lower target water-remove rate range corresponding to a higher degree of arteriosclerosis of the patient. If a value falling within the target water-remove rate range displayed by the display device, is set on the dialyzing apparatus, a patient who may have arteriosclerosis can be prevented from falling in a shock during a dialysis operation. Thus, water can be quickly removed from the blood of the patient who has arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred feature of the first aspect of the present invention, the arteriosclerosis-related information may be a parameter which changes in relation with the degree of arteriosclerosis of the patient, e.g., pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information such as a pulse-wave propagation velocity or a pulse-wave propagation time measured to determine the velocity. The pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information may be obtained during a dialysis operation, e.g., immediately after the commencement of the dialysis operation but, preferably, the information is obtained before the commencement of the dialysis operation, most preferably, immediately before the commencement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dialyzing apparatus comprising a dialyzer which removes water from blood of a patient at a pre-set water-remove rate; an arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining device which obtains arteriosclerosis-related information that is related to a degree of arteriosclerosis of the patient; and a water-remove-rate changing means for changing the pre-set water-remove rate to a target water-remove rate based on the arteriosclerosis-related information obtained by the arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Since the water-remove-rate changing means automatically changes the pre-set water-remove rate to the target water-remove rate based on the arteriosclerosis-related information of the patient, a patient who may have arteriosclerosis can be prevented from falling in a shock during a dialysis operation. Thus, water can be quickly removed from the blood of the patient who has arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred feature of the second aspect of the present invention, the dialyzing apparatus further comprises a target-water-remove-rate determining means for determining the target water-remove rate based on the arteriosclerosis-related information obtained by the arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining device, and the water-remove-rate changing means changes the pre-set water-remove rate to the target water-remove rate determined by the target-water-remove-rate determining means. Since the pre-set water-remove rate is automatically changed to the target water-remove rate based on the arteriosclerosis-related information of the patient, the patient who has arteriosclerosis can be prevented from falling in a shock during a dialysis operation. Thus, water can be quickly removed from the blood of the patient who has arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred feature of the second aspect of the present invention, the target-water-remove-rate determining means determines a target water-remove-rate range based on the arteriosclerosis-related information of the patient and a standard body weight and an actual body weight of the patient, and the water-remove-rate changing means changes the pre-set water-remove rate to a value falling within the determined target water-remove-rate range. Since the pre-set water-remove rate is automatically changed to the target water-remove rate based on the arteriosclerosis-related information of the patient, the patient who has arteriosclerosis can be prevented from falling in a shock during a dialysis operation. Thus, water can be quickly removed from the blood of the patient who has arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred feature of the second aspect of the present invention, the arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining device comprises a pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining device which obtains, as the arteriosclerosis-related-information, pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information that is related to a velocity at which a pulse wave propagates through an artery of the patient. Since the pre-set water-remove rate is automatically changed to the target water-remove rate or target water-remove rate range based on the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information of the patient, the patient who has arteriosclerosis can be prevented from falling in a shock during a dialysis operation. Thus, water can be quickly removed from the blood of the patient who has arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred feature of the second aspect of the present invention, the arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining device comprises a pulse-wave-propagation-velocity measuring device which measures, as the arteriosclerosis-related-information, a pulse-wave propagation velocity at which a pulse wave propagates through an artery of the patient, and the target-water-remove-rate determining means determines, in a two-dimensional coordinate system which is defined by a first axis indicative of pulse-wave propagation velocity and a second axis indicative of water-remove rate, the target water-remove rate range based on the measured pulse-wave propagation velocity according to a pre-determined relationship between pulse-wave propagation and water-remove rate range. Preferably, the target-water-remove-rate determining means determines a lower target water-remove rate, or a lower target water-remove rate range, corresponding to a higher pulse-wave propagation velocity. Thus, water can be quickly removed from the blood of the patient who has arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, there will be described an embodiment of the present invention, by reference to the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic view for explaining a construction of a dialyzing apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to which the present invention is applied. The dialyzing apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a measurement section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a blood dialysis section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. First, the measurement section <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> designates a blood-pressure measuring cuff which includes a belt-like cloth bag and a rubber bag accommodated in the cloth bag and which is wound around an upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of one arm of a patient that is not connected to a dialyzer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, described later. The cuff <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to a pressure sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a deflation control valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an air pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via a piping <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The deflation control valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is selectively placed in a pressure-supply position in which the control valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> permits a pressurized air to be supplied from the air pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the cuff <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a slow-deflation position in which the control valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> permits the pressurized air to be slowly discharged from the cuff <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a quick-deflation position in which the control valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> permits the pressurized air to be quickly discharged from the cuff <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The pressure sensor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> detects an air pressure PK in the cuff <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and supplies a pressure signal SP representing the detected pressure PK, to each of a static-pressure filter circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a pulse-wave filter circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The static-pressure filter circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a low-pass filter and extracts, from the pressure signal SP, a static-pressure component contained in the pressure signal SP, i.e., a cuff pressure signal SC representing the static or pressing pressure in the cuff <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cuff pressure signal SC is supplied to a control device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via an AID (analog-to-digital) converter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The pulse-wave filter circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a band-pass filter and extracts, from the pressure signal SP, an oscillating component that is produced in synchronism with heartbeat of the patient, i.e., a cuff-pulse-wave signal SM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The cuff-pulse-wave signal SM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied to the control device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via an A/D converter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A photoelectric pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> functions as a volumetric-pulse-wave detecting device. The sensor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> detects a volumetric pulse wave (i.e., a plethysmograph) representing a volume of blood present in peripheral blood vessels of a living subject. The sensor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is worn on, e.g., an end portion of a finger of the other arm than the arm around which the cuff <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is wound. The photoelectric pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has the same construction as that of a known sensor used to detect pulse rate or oxygen saturation. As shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the sensor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that can accommodate a portion of a living subject, such as an end portion of a finger; a light emitting element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> as a light source that is disposed on one of opposite walls of the housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and emits, toward skin of the subject, a red or infrared light in a wavelength range that can be reflected by hemoglobin, preferably a light having a wavelength of, e.g., about 800 nm, that is not influenced by blood oxygen saturation; and a light receiving element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is disposed on the other wall of the housing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> such that the light receiving element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is opposed to the light emitting element <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and detects the light transmitted through the portion of the subject. The light receiving element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> produces a photoelectric-pulse-wave signal SM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> representing the detected amount of light, i.e., volume of blood present in capillaries of the portion of the subject, and supplies the photoelectric-pulse-wave signal SM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the control device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via an A/D converter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An electrocardiograph-signal detecting device <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> continuously detects an electrocardiograph waveform WH, i.e., so-called electrocardiogram (ECG) representing an action potential of cardiac muscle of the subject, through a plurality of electrodes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which are adhered to respective prescribed locations of the subject, and supplies an electrocardiograph signal SE representing the detected electrocardiograph waveform WH, to the control device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> via an A/D converter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A memory device <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided by a well known memory means such as a RAM (random access memory), a magnetic-disc device (HDD), or a removable media (MO, DVD, etc.). The memory device <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> stores a relationship that is used to determine an estimated blood pressure, and a relationship that is used to determine a target water-remove rate. An input device <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> includes various keys that are manually operable by an operator to input an identification (ID) code, a standard body weight, and a measured body weight, of the patient and supply those data to the control device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A hematocrit monitor <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> optically measures, during a blood dialysis operation, a hematocrit (red-blood-cell volume percentage %) of the patient, from blood of the patient. A water-remove-rate setting device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a mode-switch dial <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is manually operable to select a manual (&ldquo;MANUAL&rdquo;) mode or an automatic (&ldquo;AUTO&rdquo;) mode, and a water-remove-rate dial <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that is manually operable to set a water-remove rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The control device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is provided by a so-called microcomputer including a CPU (central processing unit) <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a ROM (read only memory) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a RAM <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and an I/O port, not shown. The CPU <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> processes signals according to the control programs pre-stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by utilizing the temporary-storage function of the RAM <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and controls the deflation control valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the air pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In addition, the CPU <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> operates for determining a blood-pressure value BP of the patient, successively determining estimated blood-pressure values EBP of the patient, judging an abnormality of the blood pressure of the patient during a blood dialysis operation, controlling the water-remove rate, and controlling what is displayed by a display device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the CPU <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> controls respective rotation speeds of a negative-pressure pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of a water-remove control device <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a blood-circulation pump <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the blood dialysis section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Next, the blood dialysis section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> will be described. The blood dialysis section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has a construction similar to that of a common dialyzing device. More specifically described, the blood dialysis section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> includes a dialyzing-fluid circulation system as a closed circuit that includes a dialyzing-fluid supplying device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>; a constant-flow-rate valve <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which adjusts the dialyzing fluid such that the fluid flows at a constant flow rate; a gas-remove tank <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>; a warming device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>; the dialyzer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>; the water-remove control device <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> including the negative-pressure pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>; and a blood-leakage sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The blood dialysis section <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> additionally includes a blood circulation system as a closed circuit that includes a drip chamber <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> that is connected to the dialyzer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a venous-pressure sensor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>; a tube <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that is connected to a vein of the patient; a tube <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> that is connected to an artery of the patient; the blood-circulation pump <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>; a drip chamber <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>; and a-heparin injecting pump <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The dialyzing-fluid supplying device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has the function of preparing a dialyzing fluid by mixing a concentrated fluid with water at a prescribed ratio. The warming device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> keeps the prepared dialyzing fluid at a prescribed temperature. The negative-pressure pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> produces a negative pressure in a space between the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the supplying device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, thereby introducing the dialyzing fluid accumulating in the supplying device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, into the dialyzer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The negative-pressure pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> additionally adjusts a water-remove rate. The heparin injecting pump <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> injects, little by little, heparin as an anticoagulant into the circulating blood during a blood dialysis operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The dialyzer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> employs a dialysis membrane that is formed of a cellulose material such as regenerated cellulose or acetic cellulose, or a macromolecular material such as polyacrylonitrile copolymer or polymethyl methacrylate, so that the blood and the dialyzing fluid contact each other via the dialysis membrane. Thus, owing to diffusion effect and ultrafiltration effect, waste products and water are moved from the blood of the patient into the dialyzing fluid, and necessary electrolytes are moved from the dialyzing fluid into the blood. The water-remove rate is defined as a difference between the controlled fluid flow-in rate and the fluid flow-out rate, and is expressed as an amount of water removed per unit time, Wv (1/h). The water-remove rate Wv is controlled by, e.g., a pressure difference over the dialysis membrane, which in turn is controlled by a rotation speed of the negative-pressure pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The cuff-pressure changing means <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> operates, based on the cuff pressure signal SC supplied from the static-pressure filter circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the air pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the deflation control valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to quickly increase the pressing pressure of the cuff <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e., the cuff pressure PC up to a prescribed target pressure (e.g., 180 mmHg) which would be higher than a systolic blood-pressure value BPsys of the patient and subsequently slowly decrease the cuff pressure PC at a rate of from 2 to 3 mmHg/sec. After the blood-pressure determining means <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, described below, has determined a blood-pressure value BP of the patient, the cuff-pressure changing means <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> quickly decreases the cuff pressure PC down to atmospheric pressure. The blood-pressure determining means <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> determines a systolic, a mean, and a diastolic blood-pressure value BP<highlight><subscript>SYS</subscript></highlight>, BP<highlight><subscript>MEAN</subscript></highlight>, BP<highlight><subscript>DIA </subscript></highlight>of the upper arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the patient, according to well-known oscillometric method, based on the cuff-pressure signal SC continuously supplied from the static-pressure filter circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the cuff-pulse-wave signal SM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> continuously supplied from the pulse-wave filter circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, each during the slow decreasing of the cuff pressure PC under the control of the cuff-pressure changing means <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>.

The determining means <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> successively determines, based on each of the pulse-wave propagation times DT successively determined for the successive heartbeat-synchronous pulses, a pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV (m/sec) at which a pulse wave propagates through an artery of the patient, according to the following Expression 1 pre-stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The distance L (m) is a value actually measured from the patient, or a value converted from a height of the patient, and the pre-ejection period PEP is a value actually measured from the patient, a statistically obtained value, or a value experimentally obtained in advance from the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The pulse-wave propagation time DT, or the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV determined from the time DT, increases as the blood pressure, or the degree of arteriosclerosis, of the patient increases. Therefore, the time DT or the velocity PWV can be said as a mathematical function of blood pressure or degree of arteriosclerosis. For example, providing that a pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV corresponding to a prescribed blood pressure (e.g., 80 mmHg) is defined as a normalized pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, the normalized pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>increases as the degree of arteriosclerosis increases. Thus, the normalized pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>can be used as very useful arteriosclerosis-related information. The pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV can be used as the normalized pulse-wave propagation velocity PW<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. In the present embodiment, the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity determining means <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> functions as means for obtaining arteriosclerosis-related information that is related to degree of arteriosclerosis. </paragraph>

Since the hematocrit (i.e., red-blood-cell volume percentage %) of blood of the patient increases as the blood dialysis (or water removal) advances, the water-remove rate is gradually decreased as time elapses from the commencement of the current dialysis operation or as the hematocrit increases.

That is, the relationship between pulse-wave-propagation velocity PWV and target water-remove rate range is experimentally determined so that a blood dialysis operation can be finished as quickly as possible, without causing the patient to fall in a shock (i.e., an abrupt blood-pressure decrease).

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present dialyzing apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity determining means (the arteriosclerosis-related-information obtaining means) <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> (SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) which determines the pulse wave propagation velocity (the arteriosclerosis-related information) PWV, the target-water-remove-rate determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) determines the target water-remove rate based on the determined pulse wave propagation velocity PWV, and the target-water-remove-rate changing means <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (SA<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) changes the water-remove rate of the dialyzing apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so as to be equal to the target water-remove rate determined by the determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a patient <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> who suffers arteriosclerosis can be effectively prevented from falling in a shock during a blood dialysis operation, and water can be quickly removed from the patient <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> suffering arteriosclerosis, without causing an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the illustrated embodiment, the target-water-remove-rate determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) determines the target water-remove rate range, based on the measured pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV, according to the prescribed relationship, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, that is expressed by a two-dimensional coordinate system defined by an axis of abscissa representative of pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV and an axis of ordinate representative of water-remove rate, so that water can be removed as quickly as possible from the patient, without causing the patient to fall in a shock. The target-water-remove-rate changing means <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (SA<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) gradually decreases the water-remove rate, or lowers the water-remove rate range, as the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV increases. Thus, water can be quickly removed from a patient <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> suffering arteriosclerosis, without causing -an abrupt blood-pressure decrease in the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in detail in its preferred embodiment, by reference to the drawings, the invention may otherwise be embodied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV is obtained as a sort of arteriosclerosis-related information. However, the arteriosclerosis-related information may be the pulse-wave propagation time DT equal to the time difference between the R-wave of the electrocardiographic waveform represented by the electrocardiograph signal SE and the rising point of the photoelectric pulse wave represented by the photoelectric-pulse-wave signal SM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; a waveform of a pulse wave detected in an artery; a ratio of one of a pulse pressure and a blood pressure to the other; a transfer function of a pulse wave which propagates through an artery; or a value determined based on the parameter or parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the target-water-remove-rate determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> determines the target water-remove rate range. However, in the case where the water-remove-rate dial <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for manually adjusting the water-remove rate in a certain range is not employed, the determining means <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be modified to determine a target water-remove rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The illustrated dialyzing apparatus <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> employs the blood-pressure determining means <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> for determining the blood-pressure values. However, the determining means <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may not be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV is determined based on the pulse-wave propagation time DT equal to the time difference between the R-wave of the electrocardiographic waveform represented by the electrocardiograph signal SE and the rising point of the photoelectric pulse wave represented by the photoelectric-pulse-wave signal SM<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV may be determined based on a pulse-wave propagation time DT equal to a time difference between a second heart sound II and a rising point of a pressure pulse wave detected by a pressure-pulse-wave sensor from an artery of a prescribed portion of a patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied with other changes, improvements and modifications that may occur to a person skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
