<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a portable games board that may be used as a scoreboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Typically, scoreboards consist of a large black metal plate having a series of peas protruding therefrom and a series of number plates on which digits are painted. The number plates are hung on the pegs to display the score of the game. In order to adjust the score, it is necessary to remove and replace each number plate separately. Depending on the size and weight of the number plates this task may be a difficult, particularly if the score changes quickly during a game. Furthermore, to display a score having the same digit in it more than once, it is necessary to have several number plates painted with the same digit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> These types of scoreboards are often fixed to a fence surrounding a sports ground or mounted to a fixed elevated structure. Therefore, these scoreboards are not easily moved between venues. In addition, children and younger players of a particular sport practicing the skills of a game cannot make use of this type of fixed scoreboard at home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an alternative games board that can be used as a scoreboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention there is provided a portable games board, the games board including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> a flexible sheet on which a series of digits representing numerical information relating to a game may be formed; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> a support structure for holding the sheet so that the digits formed on the sheet can be viewed, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> wherein each digit includes a plurality of segments, and the value of each digit observed may be altered by selecting which segments forming the digits are visible, and each segment required to form a digit may be made visible by: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> i) uncovering a section of the sheet having a visible mark on it that forms one of the required segments; and/or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> ii) positioning a panel having a visible segment marked thereon on the sheet in a location of a required segment, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> wherein the flexible sheet is sufficiently flexible to enable the sheet to be folded or rolled for transportation or storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;numerical information&rdquo; may be a game score, or any other number such as a distance, ball speed, count on a batter (as in baseball) or time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides a portable games board in which the value of each digit and thus the numerical game information displayed on the sheet can be adjusted by selectively uncovering segments of digit marked on the sheet and/or positioning on the sheet panels which have segments of digits marked thereon. The portable games board can therefore be used by children and other players of a game to simulate a professional sporting event. In addition, the portable games board is easy to store and transport due to its flexibility and small number of components . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the sheet has flaps that can be moved between a first position in which the segment is made visible, and a second position in which the segment is not visible, so that the necessary segments for forming a digit can be displayed. The segments may be marked directly on the sheet (and can be obscured by the flaps), or otherwise they can be marked on the flaps (which can be folded over to obscure the segment). Preferably the flaps are joined to the sheet so that a large number of separate pieces are not required to be kept together to have a complete games board. This is a significant advantage, especially for a games board for use by children who may loose parts of a set that comes in many pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, it is also possible for other types of elements to be used instead, such as plastic panels that can be held onto a plastic sheet by electrostatic forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the segments of the digits are marked on the sheet, and a desired digit is able to be formed on the sheet by uncovering the required segments (for instance, by moving a covering panel from the second position in which it covers the segment to the first position in which it is uncovered). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Preferably, at least one of the digits that can be represented on the sheet is in the form of a figure eight, and flaps covering the sheet can be folded to allow segments of the figure eight to be viewed or obscured so that the figure eight can be altered to represent any single digit from 0 to 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the digits that can be represented on the sheet are figure eights applied to the surface thereof, the figure eights having seven linear strokes commonly appearing in a digital liquid crystal display (LCD) or light emitting diode (LED). Accordingly, it is also referred that each figure eight has seven associated flaps, each flap being able to be used to cover one of the seven segments forming the figure eight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the situation where the sheet includes flaps, it is preferred that the sheet and flaps have co-operating hooks and loops attached to their respective faces for securing the flaps while covering or uncovering the segments of the digits. For example, the flaps can have a velcro-type hook-bearing strip on one face, and the sheet can have a velcro-type loop-bearing strip on a matching face for holding the flaps in one of the first and second positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative embodiment, the flaps can be held in position by electrostatic forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the sheet includes a representation of a target so that a player can practice their skills by aiming at the target. For example, a player may practice handballing, kicking, throwing or hitting a ball at the target on the sheet. The target may be represented by a marked target area, and/or a hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the markings defining the target and the digits forming the scoreboard are on opposite sides of the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the support structure consists of or includes a pair of poles. In use, the pair of poles can be positioned in a spaced apart upright orientation, and the sheet can be mounted to the poles. The support structure may also include one or more crossbars for supporting upper (and lower) edges of the sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The poles may be or any suitable configuration. They may be multiple-part with ends shaped to enable the pieces to be slid together. The individual pieces for constructing one pole may be separate or may be linked together by an internal length of elastic in the manner of some tent poles. In another alternative, the poles may include two telescopically extendable parts that can be extended to elongate the pole and twisted relative to each other to lock the pole into the elongated position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In normal use, the support structure of the present invention holds the sheet in position for use as either a target or scoreboard. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the poles of the support structure may have the dual function of being able to represent goal posts when the sheet is removed. For example, the poles may be used an goal posts for Australian rules football, gridiron, soccer, field hockey or ice hockey. It is also envisaged that a not may be suspended between the poles for games such as volley ball and badminton </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The sheet-type scoreboard may in fact constitute a part of the equipment used to play a sport or game. For example, the scoreboard may be a volleyball net having a game score panel on one or both sides thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the portable poles can be connected to an anchoring structure to hold the poles upright relative to the ground. The anchoring structure may be of any suitable configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In an alternative, the support structure may be in the form of any other arrangement that can hold the sheet upright and flat during display. For example, the support structure may include two or more hooks that hook on to a top edge of the sheet and over the top edge of a fence, or into the links of a chain fence. In this embodiment, the sheet may have reinforced holes along its upper edge for receiving the hooks.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a front view of a games board of a second embodiment of the invention.</paragraph>
</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a games board generally identified by reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The games board includes a sheet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of plastic on which a series of digits representing the score or a game may be formed and a support structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the form of two poles <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The sheet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is sufficiently flexible or pliable to enable the sheet to be folded and/or rolled up for transportation and storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The sheet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has two sleeves <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> running along opposite edges through which the poles are threaded. An anchor structure in the form of weights <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> contacting a central cylindrical slot receives the-ends of the poles to hold the poles upright relative to the ground. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the sheet is held taut between the poles <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so that the digits formed on the sheet can be easily viewed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a target marked on the reverse face of the games board. A person can practice their skills by handballing, kicking and throwing a ball at the target. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative target illustration suitable for baseball. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates in detail that each digit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> formed on the sheet consists of seven segments <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the form of a <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Each segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is printed on the sheet and is covered by a plastic flap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that is permanently joined (for example, sewn and/or bonded) to the sheet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The segments <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are represented in the figure in dark bold lines and the flaps <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, both folded and unfolded, are shown in broken lines. A single flap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> overlies each segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that each flap <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be folded to reveal the segment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> printed on the sheet beneath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the &ldquo;unfolded position&rdquo;, i.e. a &ldquo;first position&rdquo;, the flap covers the segment. In the &ldquo;folded&rdquo; position, i.e. a &ldquo;second position&rdquo;, the flap does not cover the segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the flaps <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the left-hand digit remain in the first position (closed) so that none of the segments <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are visible. The three remaining digits illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> show a mixture of some of the flaps <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> folded and unfolded so that the some of the segments <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have been uncovered. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the flaps can be adjusted so the figure eight marked on the sheet can be altered to represent any digit from 0 to 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Although not illustrated in the drawings, the flaps may be held in either a folded or unfolded position by cooperating hook and loop fasteners (velcro strips) attached to the flaps and sheet. That is, the hook and loop fastener can fasten the flaps to either i) obstruct from view the segments printed in the sheet or ii) uncover the segments printed on the sheet to form a digit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It will be understood by persons skilled in the art of the present invention that many modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For example, the poles of the support structure may be telescopic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> For another example, the flaps may be held either flat against the sheet or folded back onto the sheet by electrostatic forces. </paragraph>
