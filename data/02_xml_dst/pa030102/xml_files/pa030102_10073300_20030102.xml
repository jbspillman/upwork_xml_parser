<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to methods of generating a functional mammalian single chain MHC class I complex in prokaryotic expression systems and a functional human single chain MHC class I complex in eukaryotic or prokaryotic expression systems, which complexes are capable of presenting specific antigenic peptides restricted to class I MHC and recognizable by specific CTL clones or CD&plus;8 T-cells. The present invention further relates to a method of generating a functional mammalian single chain MHC class I-peptide complex in eukaryotic, or preferably prokaryotic expression systems, to nucleic acid constructs encoding said single chain MHC class I complexes and to a novel human single chain MHC class I polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a complex of antigens encoded by a group of linked loci, which are collectively termed H-2 in the mouse and HLA in humans. The two principal classes of the MHC antigens, class I and class II, each comprise a set of cell surface glycoproteins which play a role in determining tissue type and transplant compatibility. In transplantation reactions, cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) respond mainly against foreign class I glycoproteins, while helper T-cells respond mainly against foreign class II glycoproteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are expressed on the surface of nearly all cells. These molecules function in presenting peptides which are mainly derived from endogenously synthesized proteins to CD8&plus; T cells via an interaction with the &agr;&bgr; T-cell receptor &lsqb;1-4&rsqb;. The class I MHC molecule is a heterodimer composed of a 46-kDa heavy chain which is non-covalently associated with the 12-kDa light chain &bgr;-2 microglobulin. Class I MHC-restricted peptides, which are typically 8-10-amino acid-long, bind to the heavy chain &agr;1-&agr;2 groove via two or three anchor residues that interact with corresponding binding pockets in the MHC molecule. The &bgr;-2 microglobulin chain plays an important role in MHC class I intracellular transport, peptide binding, and conformational stability &lsqb;5&rsqb;. For most class I molecules, the formation of a heterodimer consisting of the MHC class I heavy chain, peptide (self or antigenic) and &bgr;-2 microglobulin is required for biosynthetic maturation and cell-surface expression &lsqb;5&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Research studies performed on peptide binding to class I MHC molecules enable to define specific MHC motifs functional in displaying peptides derived from viral or tumor antigens that are potentially immunogenic and might elicit specific response from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) &lsqb;6,7&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The realization that CTLs have an important role in the control of many diseases, including chronic viral diseases, such as AIDS, and cancer have lead to an increased need to produce sufficient amounts of stable class I MHC complexes for functional and structural studies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Soluble MHC molecules bound to various peptides are a valuable tool for the study of disease-related immune responses, for characterizing MHC-T-cell receptor (TCR) interactions &lsqb;6&rsqb;, for structural studies &lsqb;4&rsqb;, and more recently for direct visualization of antigen-specific T cells &lsqb;8&rsqb;. These molecules can be also used to activate specific CTLs in vitro as well as to study their phenotypic characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In recent years, various approaches have been used in attempts to develop an in vitro protocol for the induction of cytotoxic T cell responses against viral and tumor antigens &lsqb;9-10&rsqb;. To effectively activate T-cells, a high density of MHC-peptide complexes on the surface of the antigen presenting cells must be utilized &lsqb;7-10&rsqb;. Thus, a desirable approach for in-vitro T-cell activation would be to use soluble MHC-peptide complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To overcome the low affinity binding of TCRs to soluble MHC molecules and as such to provide efficient T-cell activation, multimerization of the MHC-peptide complexes must be effected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Soluble MHC multimers posses a higher avidity for T-cells since they provide multi-point binding of TCRs with their MHC-peptide ligands. As such, multimeric forms (tetramers) of MHC-peptide complexes have been the center of much interest recently, because they can be used for direct phenotypic characterization of T cell responses in normal as well as pathological conditions, thus, providing insight into the pathopysiology and mechanisms of various diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, such studies require a reproducible method for producing large amounts of soluble and functional multimeric MHC-peptide complexes. Thus, attempts were made to produce recombinant MHC class I and class II complexes &lsqb;11-23&rsqb; which are soluble and which can be produced in large quantities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Early studies utilizing recombinant techniques, separately expressed the heavy chain and &bgr;-2 microglobulin components of the MHC complex in <highlight><italic>E. Coli </italic></highlight>and subsequently refolded them in-vitro in the presence of an antigenic peptide &lsqb;11&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> More recently, recombinant MHC complexes were expressed in eukaryotic expression systems and secreted therefrom in the form of a single polypeptide which included the heavy chain covalently linked to the &bgr;-2 microglobulin chain thus forming a stable and functional MHC complex which can be subsequently bound to a peptide of interest &lsqb;12-15, 19, 21-23&rsqb;. The expression of functional MHC complexes in eukaryotic cells suffers from several inherent limitations. Since the expressed polypeptides form a functional MHC complex they bind peptides endogenously derived from the cells utilized for expression and as such the purified MHC complex must be subjected to a peptide exchange step following purification &lsqb;13&rsqb;. In addition, the production yields of these single-chain MHC-peptide complexes was limited, typically reaching levels of several hundred micrograms per liter of culture supernatant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a novel approach for the production of unprecedented large amounts of soluble, stable and functional MHC-peptide complex by utilizing high level bacterial expression of a single-chain MHC class I polypeptide or co-expression of the single chain MHC class I polypeptide and an MHC class I restricted antigenic peptide followed by in-vitro reconstitution of the scMHC class I-peptide complex via redox-shuffling and refolding in the presence of the antigenic peptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a novel human single chain MHC class I polypeptide which is functional and which can therefore be utilized in either the monomeric or preferably the multimeric form to present MHC class I restricted antigenic peptides to CTL clones or to CD8&plus; T-cells from various sources. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The present invention is of methods of generating a functional mammalian single chain MHC class I complex in prokaryotic expression systems and a functional human single chain MHC class I complex in eukaryotic or prokaryotic expression systems, which complexes are capable of presenting specific antigenic peptides restricted to specific CTL clones. The present invention is further of a method of generating a functional mammalian single chain MHC class I-peptide complex in eukaryotic, or preferably prokaryotic expression systems. The present invention is also of nucleic acid constructs encoding said single chain MHC class I complexes and of a novel human single chain MHC class I polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the accompanying descriptions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings described in the Examples section. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Soluble class I MHC-peptide complexes are invaluable reagents for characterizing immune responses involving CTLs, for measuring the affinity of MHC-TCR interactions, and for visualization of antigen-specific T cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> One of the limitations in generating and using recombinant MHC-peptide complexes is a relatively low production efficiency. Most of the present studies utilize production methods that are based on transfection of cells with MHC constructs which express and secrete either scMHC or complexed MHC to the cell culture medium &lsqb;12-23&rsqb;. These complexes contain peptides from endogenously-expressed proteins which have to be subsequently exchanged with the desired peptide to be displayed in the complex &lsqb;13&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Alternative methods for efficiently producing recombinant MHC-peptide complexes is by expression of the heavy chain and &bgr;-2 microglobulin separately in <highlight><italic>E. Coli</italic></highlight>. followed by co-refolding in vitro in the presence of antigenic peptide &lsqb;8, 11&rsqb;. Although such methods present some advantages as compared to the eukaryotic methods described above, the quantity and purity of the MHC complex produced thereby still fall well below of that required for various studies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> While reducing the present invention to practice, it was uncovered that recombinant single chain (sc) MHC-peptide complexes produced in <highlight><italic>E. Coli </italic></highlight>constitute an efficient new way for the generation of unprecedented large amounts (e.g., grams) of highly purified and functional MHC-peptide complexes, as well as MHC-peptide tetramers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As is further described in the Examples section that follows human scMHC-peptide complexes generated from <highlight><italic>E. Coli </italic></highlight>inclusion bodies by in vitro refolding in the presence of antigenic peptides are highly pure and functional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a nucleic acid construct which includes a first nucleic acid sequence including a first polynucleotide encoding a functional human &bgr;-2 microglobulin translationally fused upstream of a second polynucleotide encoding a functional human MHC class I heavy chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As used herein the term &ldquo;functional&rdquo; when used in reference to the &bgr;-2 microglobulin and heavy chain polypeptides regions of a single chain MHC class I complex refers to any portion of each which is capable of contributing to the assembly of a functional single chain MHC class I complex (i.e., capable of binding and presenting to CTLs specific antigenic peptides when complexed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the first polynucleotide encodes the entire &bgr;-2 microglobulin polypeptide while the second polynucleotide encodes the &agr;1-3 domains of the heavy chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The phrases &ldquo;translationally fused&rdquo; and &ldquo;in frame&rdquo; are interchangeably used herein to refer to polynucleotides which are covalently linked to form a single continuous open reading frame spanning the length of the coding sequences of the linked polynucleotides. Such polynucleotides can be covalently linked directly or preferably indirectly through a spacer or linker region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the nucleic acid sequence further includes an in-frame linker polynucleotide. This linker polynucleotide encodes a linker peptide and is interposed between the first and said second polynucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The linker peptide is selected of an amino acid sequence which is inherently flexible, such that the polypeptides encoded by the first and said second polynucleotides independently and natively fold following expression thereof, thus facilitating the formation of a functional single chain (sc) human MHC class I complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the linker peptide is as set forth in SEQ ID NO:10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Thus, the first nucleic acid sequence of this aspect of the present invention, encodes a functional human single chain MHC class I polypeptide. Preferably, the first nucleic acid sequence is as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first nucleic acid sequence further includes an in-frame tag sequence (such as that set forth in SEQ ID NO:20) which encodes a Is peptide capable of being enzymatically modified to include a binding entity. As is further described in the Examples section that follows, the binding entity, which can be, for example, biotin, can be utilized by the present invention to assemble a plurality of scMHC class I polypeptides into multimers, by providing a ligand, such as avidin or streptavidin which serves as a common attachment entity for the scMHC class I polypeptides. MHC class I multimers are particularly advantageous for peptide mediated CTL activation as is further described in the Examples section which follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the nucleic acid construct further includes a first cis acting regulatory sequence. The cis acting regulatory sequence can include a promoter sequence and additional transcriptional or a translational enhancer sequences all of which serve for facilitating the expression of the nucleic acid sequence when introduced into a host cell. Specific examples of promoters are described hereinbelow in context of various eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression systems and in the Examples section which follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Thus, the nucleic acid construct of this aspect of the present invention is capable of expressing in a host cell, a recombinant human single chain MHC class I polypeptide which includes the functional human &bgr;-2 microglobulin and the functional human MHC class I heavy chain and a linker peptide interposed therebetween. Preferably, the expressible recombinant polypeptide is as set forth in SEQ ID NO:5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the nucleic acid construct also includes a second nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigenic peptide. The antigenic peptide is selected such that it is capable of binding a human MHC class I complex. As is further described in the Examples section which follows, various CTL specific antigenic peptides can be encoded by the second nucleic acid sequence, including but not limited to cancer cell derived antigenic peptides, virally derived antigenic peptides and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Preferably the second nucleic acid sequence is translationally fused upstream of the first nucleic acid sequence, such that the nucleic acid construct according to this aspect of the present invention encodes a single chimeric amino acid sequence (chimeric polypeptide) which includes the antigenic peptide fused upstream of the functional human &bgr;-2 microglobulin which is in turn fused upstream of the functional human MHC class I heavy chain. The antigenic peptide can be fused directly to the functional human &bgr;-2 microglobulin or it can be fused thereto through a linker peptide in a manner similar to that described hereinabove with respect to the &bgr;-2 microglobulin-MHC class I heavy chain fusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the above described configuration of the nucleic acid construct of this aspect of the present invention is particularly advantageous since, a single construct enables the expression of a single chimeric polypeptide which includes all three components necessary for presenting specific antigenic peptides restricted to specific CTL clones, thus substantially simplifying the expression/purification and folding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In addition, the nucleic acid construct described above ensures that the expression product always includes a correct ratio of components of the chimeric polypeptide (1:1:1), thus traversing limitations resultant from separately expressing each component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the nucleic acid construct includes a second cis acting regulatory sequence which serves for expressing the second nucleic acid sequence when introduced into a host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that a single cis acting regulatory sequence can be utilized by the nucleic acid construct to direct transcription of a single transcript which includes the first and second nucleic acid sequence. In such a case, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) can be utilized so as to allow translation of the internally positioned nucleic acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Although co-expression of the scMHC class I polypeptide and the antigenic peptide from a single nucleic acid construct is advantageous when transforming a host cell, the two nucleic acid sequences can alternatively be included in two separate nucleic acid construct which can be utilized to co-transform a single cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In any case, it will be appreciated that the nucleic acid construct or constructs must be configured such that the levels of expression of both the scMHC class I polypeptide and the binding peptide thereof are stoichiometrically correct (a 1:1 peptide to scMHC class I polypeptide ratio is preferred) so as to allow efficient assembly of the scMHC class I-peptide complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Preferably the promoter utilized by the nucleic acid construct(s) of the present invention is a strong constitutive promoter such that high levels of expression are attained for the first and second nucleic acid sequences following host cell transformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that high levels of expression can also be effected by transforming the host cell with a high copy number of the nucleic acid construct, or by utilizing cis acting sequences which stabilize the resultant transcript and as such decrease the degradation or &ldquo;turn-over&rdquo; of such a transcript. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a transformed host cell including the nucleic acid construct or constructs described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the phrase &ldquo;transformed cell&rdquo; describes a cell into which an exogenous nucleic acid sequence is introduced to thereby stabily or transiently genetically alter the host cell. It may occur under natural or artificial conditions using various methods well known in the art some of which are described in detail hereinbelow in context with specific examples of host cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The transformed host cell can be a eukaryotic cell, such as, for example, a mammalian cell, an insect cell, a plant cell, a yeast cell and a protozoa cell, or alternatively, the cell can be a bacterial cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> When utilized for eukaryotic host cell expression, the nucleic acid construct(s) according to the present invention can be a shuttle vector, which can propagate both in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(wherein the construct comprises an appropriate selectable marker and origin of replication) and be compatible for expression in eukaryotic host cells. The nucleic acid construct(s) according to the present invention can be, for example, a plasmid, a bacmid, a phagemid, a cosmid, a phage, a virus or an artificial chromosome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the host cell is a mammalian cell of, for example, a mammalian cell culture. Suitable mammalian expression systems include, but are not limited to, pcDNA3, pcDNA3.1(&plus;/&minus;), pZeoSV2(&plus;/&minus;), pSecTag2, pDisplay, pEF/myc/cyto, pCMV/myc/cyto, pCR3.1, which are available from Invitrogen, pCI which is available from Promega, pBK-RSV and pBK-CMV which are available from Stratagene, pTRES which is available from Clontech, and their derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Insect cell cultures can also be utilized to express the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention. Suitable insect expression systems include, but are not limited to the baculovirus expression system and its derivatives which are commercially available from numerous suppliers such as Invitrogen (maxBac&trade;), Clontech (BacPak&trade;), or Gibco (Bac-to-BaC&trade;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Expression of the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention can also be effected in plants cells. As used herein, the phrase &ldquo;plant cell&rdquo; can refer to plant protoplasts, cells of a plant tissue culture, cells of plant derived tissues or cells of whole plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> There are various methods of introducing nucleic acid constructs into plant cells. Such methods rely on either stable integration of the nucleic acid construct or a portion thereof into the genome of the plant cell, or on transient expression of the nucleic acid construct in which case these sequences are not stabily integrated into the genome of the plant cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> There are two principle methods of effecting stable genomic integration of exogenous nucleic acid sequences such as those included within the nucleic acid construct of the present invention into plant cell genomes: </paragraph>

Methods of inoculation of the plant tissue vary depending upon the plant species and the Agrobacterium delivery system. A widely used approach is the leaf disc procedure, see for example, Horsch et al. in Plant Molecular Biology Manual A5, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht (1988) p. 1-9. A supplementary approach employs the Agrobacterium delivery system in combination with vacuum infiltration. The Agrobacterium system is especially viable in the creation of stabily transformed dicotyledenous plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> There are various methods of direct DNA transfer into plant cells. In electroporation, protoplasts are briefly exposed to a strong electric field. In microinjection, the DNA is mechanically injected directly into the cells using very small micropipettes. In microparticle bombardment, the DNA is adsorbed on microprojectiles such as magnesium sulfate crystals, tungsten particles or gold particles, and the microprojectiles are physically accelerated into cells or plant tissues. Direct DNA transfer can also be utilized to transiently transform plant cells. </paragraph>

Viruses that have been shown to be useful for the transformation of plant cell hosts include CaV, TMV and BV. Transformation of plants using plant viruses is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,237 (BGV), EP-A 67,553 (TMV), Japanese Published Application No. 63-14693 (TMV), EPA 194,809 (BV), EPA 278,667 (BV); and Gluzman, Y. et al, Communications in Molecular Biology: Viral Vectors, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, pp. 172-189 (1988). Pseudovirus particles for use in expressing foreign DNA in many hosts, including plants, is described in WO 87/06261. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Construction of plant RNA viruses for the introduction and expression of non-viral exogenous nucleic acid sequences in plants is demonstrated by the above references as well as by Dawson, W. O. et al., Virology (1989) 172:285-292; Takamatsu et al. EMBO J. (1987) 6:307-311; French et al. Science (1986) 231:1294-1297; and Takamatsu et al. FEBS Letters (1990) 269:73-76. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> When the virus is a DNA virus, the constructions can be made to the virus itself. Alternatively, the virus can first be cloned into a bacterial plasmid for ease of constructing the desired viral vector with the nucleic acid sequences described above. The virus can then be excised from the plasmid. If the virus is a DNA virus, a bacterial origin of replication can be attached to the viral DNA, which is then replicated by the bacteria. Transcription and translation of this DNA will produce the coat protein which will encapsidate the viral DNA. If the virus is an RNA virus, the virus is generally cloned as a cDNA and inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is then used to make all of the constructions. The RNA virus is then produced by transcribing the viral sequence of the plasmid and translation of the viral genes to produce the coat protein(s) which encapsidate the viral RNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Construction of plant RNA viruses for the introduction and expression in plants of non-viral exogenous nucleic acid sequences such as those included in the construct of the present invention is demonstrated by the above references as well as in U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that when expressed in eukaryotic expression systems such as those described above, the nucleic acid construct preferably includes a signal peptide encoding sequence such that the polypeptides produced from the first and second nucleic acid sequences are directed via the attached signal peptide into secretion pathways. For example, in mammalian, insect and yeast host cells, the expressed polypeptides can be secreted to the growth medium, while in plant expression systems the polypeptides can be secreted into the apoplast, or directed into a subcellular organelle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> According to a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the host cell is a bacterial cell, such as for example, <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> According to an additional aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of producing a functional MHC class I molecule. the method according to this aspect of the present invention utilizes any of the nucleic acid constructs described for expressing, in bacteria, a single chain MHC class I polypeptide including a functional mammalian &bgr;-2 microglobulin amino acid sequence directly or indirectly covalently linked to a functional mammalian MHC class I heavy chain amino acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Following expression, the single chain MHC class I polypeptide is isolated and purified as described below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Expression, Refolding and Purification of scMHC-Peptide Complexes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The HLA-A2, &bgr;-2 microglobulin, and the scMHC constructs subcloned into pET21 were expressed under IPTG induction, forming intracellular inclusion bodies in BL-21 DE3 cells. Inclusion bodies were isolated and purified from the induced BL21 cells and solubilized in 6M Guanidine HCl pH 7.4. Following reduction with 65 mM DTE, inclusion bodies were refolded in a redox-shuffling buffer system (0.1M Tris, 0.5M Arginine, 0.09 mM oxidized glutathione, pH 8.0) in the presence of a 5 to 10 molar excess of the antigenic peptides derived from gp100 or the HTLV-1 viral peptide described above &lsqb;26, 52&rsqb;. Following refolding, the protein was dialyzed and concentrated by a Minisette system (Filtron, Northborough, Mass.) using a 10K cutoff cassette.

<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The s.c-b2-A2-BirA (scMHC-BirA) construct also expressed as described above was refolded in the presence of peptides 209 or 280 and purified by size exclusion chromatography on TSK3000 column (elution buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8). The scMHC-peptide-BirA complexes were concentrated to 20-30 mM (1-1.5 mg/ml) by Centricon 30 (Amicon) and were then subjected to enzymatic biotinylation for 16 hr at 25&deg; C. using a biotin protein ligase-Bir A enzyme (AVIDITY). Buffer exchange and removal of excess biotin from the biotinylated complexes was performed using Centricon 30 ultrafiltration. Tetrameric arrays of biotinylated scMHC-peptide complexes were formed by the addition of streptavidin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) at a molar ration of 4:1 scMHC-peptide complex:streptavidin, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> ELISA Assays: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Maxisorb immunoplates (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, Ill.) were coated overnight at 4&deg; C. with 1 mg/ml anti-HLA monoclonal antibody BB7.2 (ATCC HB82) and blocked using PBS including 3% BSA. Biotinylated anti-HLA W6/32 monoclonal antibody (ATCC HB95) was used for detection of the HLA complex via a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In addition, biotinylated or unbiotinylated scMHC-BirA-peptide complexes were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with washed MagnaBind streptavidin beads (PIERCE). An external magnetic field was used to separate biotinylated complexes bound to the beads from unbound material. The supernatant was pooled away from bound sample and the beads were blocked with 2% MPBS (PBS &plus;2% semi-skimmed milk powder) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The biotinylated complexes were subsequently assayed with the conformational dependent antibody W6/32 and detected using anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The circular dichroism spectra of the scMHC-peptide complexes was measured at room temperature via a spectropolarimeter (JASCO 500) adjusted to a sensitivity of 0.5 mdeg/cm and a scan speed of 10 nm/minute. Scans were performed between 195 and 275 nm at a protein concentration of 0.27 mg/ml. Secondary structure calculations were measured using published programs &lsqb;29&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Mass Spectrometry Analysis of scMHC-Peptide Complexes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The scMHC-peptide complex was resolved by HPLC on a 2.1&times;30 mm C-8 column (AQUAPORE RP-300, Applied Biosystems), and eluted with a linear gradient of 15-65% Acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.05 TFA, at 1.25%/min and a flow rate of 150 ml/min. The sample was microsprayed directly from the HPLC column into an electrospray (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan) and analyzed in the positive ion mode. The mass estimation of the proteins was done using the deconvolution algorithm, which transforms an ESI mass spectral plot of relative abundance versus mass-to-charge ratios into a plot of relative abundance versus mass. Each sequence of multiply charged ion peaks in the acquired mass spectrum corresponding to one sample component, is converted into a single peak positioned at the molecular mass M in the deconvoluted spectrum. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> CTL clones specific for melanoma peptides were provided by Drs. Steven Rosenberg and Mark Dudley (Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH). These CTL clones were generated by cloning from bulk cultures of PBMCs acquired from patients receiving peptide immunizations &lsqb;24&rsqb;. The CTLs were subsequently expanded using irradiated PBMCs and the OKT3 antibody (30 ng/ml) in the presence of 50 CU/ml IL-2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The CTL clones (1&times;10<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>/well) were washed in tissue culture medium and incubated in duplicates or triplicates with various concentrations of scMHC-peptide tetramers in tissue culture medium for 24 hrs at 37&deg; C. Alternatively scMHC-peptide complexes were immobilized onto Maxisorb immunoplates over night at 4&deg; C. and CTL clones in culture medium were subsequently added to the wells and incubated for 24 hrs at 37&deg; C. Following incubation supernatants were collected via centrifugation and IL-2 and IFNg present in the culture supernatants were assayed using a double sandwich antibody-capture enzyme immunoassay (Flexia, BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, Calif.). Concentrations of IL-2 and INF&ggr; in the culture supernatants was determined against a calibration curve of recombinant human IL-2 and INF&ggr;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Expression, Refolding, and Purification of Recombinant Single-Chain MHC-Peptide Complexes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> To produce soluble single-chain MHC-peptide complexes we subcloned the genes encoding the single-chain MHC into a pET system expression vector in which expression is driven by the phage T7 promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The plasmid constructs used in this study are described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Expression of the scMHC gene in <highlight><italic>E. Coli </italic></highlight>BL21 cells was very efficient and recombinant protein accumulated as insoluble intracellular inclusion bodies. The single-chain MHC could be detected as the major band on SDS-PAGE of solubilized whole cells (not shown) as well as isolated purified inclusion bodies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The expression of the scMHC protein was comparable to that of the separate components, i.e., the transmembrane HLA-A2 heavy chain and &bgr;-2 microglobulin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Very efficient expression was also obtained for the scMHC-BirA protein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Purified inclusion bodies contained 80-90% recombinant scMHC. Inclusion bodies were purified, solubilized in 6M guanidine HCl, and refolded by in vitro redox-shuffling buffer system in the presence of the antigenic peptide. Three different peptides were used for the refolding of the scMHC molecules. Two peptides (G9-209-2M and G9-280-2V) are tumor associated antigens derived from the melanoma common antigen gp100 &lsqb;26&rsqb; and one is a viral peptide derived from HTLV-1 (TAX) &lsqb;53&rsqb;. These peptides were previously shown to be HLA-A2 restricted &lsqb;26, 53&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Refolded complexes were dialyzed and concentrated following by purification using size-exclusion chromatography on TSK3000 column. SDS-PAGE analysis, under non-reducing conditions, of refolded purified scMHC-peptide complexes revealed a homogenous monomeric population of molecules that migrated as a uniform single band corresponding to the scMHC molecule with an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa as calculated according to the relative migration against a set of molecular weight markers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, purified homogenous scMHC-peptide complexes were obtained with all three peptides tested. When the scMHC was refolded in the absence of a peptide, a highly aggregated protein was observed which was composed of a heterogeneous population of molecules as analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE; this indicates the existence of an unstable population of molecules that are improperly folded (data not shown). Thus, a uniform population of monomers could only be found in the peptide-induced refolding preparations. The refolded scMHC-peptide complexes could be stored at &minus;70&deg; C. and re-used upon thawing. The yield of the refolded purified single-chain MHC complexes was 20-25%, i.e. 20-25 mg of a purified soluble complex was obtained from 100 mg of refolded inclusion body protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Similar results were obtained with the scMHC-BirA-peptide complexes, which contain a sequence tag at the C-terminus of the HLA-A2 for site specific biotinylation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). The apparent molecular weight of 48 kDa was observed for this molecule reflecting the increase in the size of the scMHC molecule predicted by the addition of the BirA peptide tag and the linker connecting it to HLA-A2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Thus, these results indicate that scMHC-peptide complexes can be produced in vitro by refolding of <highlight><italic>E. Coli </italic></highlight>inclusion bodies in the presence of antigenic peptides. The refolding process is efficient and a homogenous population of complexes can be obtained with high yields and purity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Biochemical and Biophysical Characterization of Single-Chain MHC-Peptide Complexes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the scMHC peptide complexes were pure and homogenous as judged by SDS-PAGE. Size exclusion chromatography on TSK3000 column revealed that the purified scMHC-peptide complexes were eluted as monomers with a molecular mass of 45 kDa (not shown). When purified complex was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 0.15 mM (&tilde;6 mg/ml) and analyzed for its molecular form on a size-exclusion TSK3000 column in PBS, no indication of dimerization or aggregation, was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> To evaluate the secondary structure of the single-chain MHC-peptide complex, protein purified through size-exclusion chromatography was examined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Spectra of the complex showed a characteristic minima at 218 nm consistent with a largely &bgr;-sheet structure. When analyzed for secondary structural calculations the spectra was indicative of a specific pattern of secondary structure which included 62% &bgr;-sheet, 5% &bgr;-turn, 8% &agr;-helix and 18% aromatic side chain contribution. When denatured at 80&deg; C., the spectra profile indicated that most of the characteristic &bgr;-sheet structure was lost and the CD signal increased, indicating random coils were generated as the result of denaturation. The melting curve showed that the complex containing peptide G9-209-2M was thermally stable with a melting temperature of approximately 60&deg; C. (data not shown). These results are similar to the thermal denaturation curves for HLA-A2 complexed with influenza virus peptides as was monitored by the change in the CD signal at 218 nm &lsqb;31&rsqb;. Thus it is concluded that these secondary structure features are characteristic of correct folded MHC-peptide complexes &lsqb;31&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The refolded scMHC-peptide complexes were also assayed using conformation-specific antibodies, which recognize MHC-peptide complexes only when correctly folded. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the anti-HLA-A2 specific mAb fragment BB7.2 and the mAb fragment W6/32 specific for a fully assembled, peptide-containing HLA-A2 detected soluble scMHC-peptide complex. The W6/32 antibody specifically recognized, in a concentration dependent manner, the refolded and purified scMHC complexes containing any of the two gp100-derived peptides indicating that the complexes are correctly folded, include the peptide, and are structurally functional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The specific recognition of the scMHC-BirA-peptide complex by the W6/32 antibody was also effected when tested on biotinylated complexes that were immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). The ELISA signal from beads coated with biotinylated scMHC-BirA-peptide complexes was 5-6 fold higher than scMHC-BirA-peptide complex that was not subjected to biotinylation by the BirA enzyme (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in order to clearly demonstrate that the scMHC complex is folded correctly and includes the peptide. The refolded and purified complex was concentrated to 6 mg/ml and a sample was subjected to analysis by electron spray mass spectrometry. The complex sample was first resolved by HPLC on a C-8 column and was subsequently eluted with a linear gradient of Acetonitrile in TFA, leading to separate sequential elution of the peptide and the scMHC protein from the column. The eluted samples were microsprayed directly from the HPLC column into an electrospray ion trap (ESI) mass spectrometer and analyzed in the positive ion mode. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the eluted peptide has an expected mass of 1035 dalton which corresponds to the mass of the G9-209-2M peptide used for refolding the scMHC-peptide complex. This was the only peptide detected indicating that the refolded complex is a homogenous population of molecules containing a single specific peptide. A minor peak with a mass of 1057 daltons was also observed, which peak corresponds to the G9-209-2M peptide including a sodium ion which probably originated from the PBS buffer in which the complex was purified and concentrated prior to analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The mass estimation of the scMHC complex was done using a deconvolution algorithm, which transforms an ESI mass spectral plot of relative abundance versus mass-to-charge ratios into a plot of relative abundance versus mass (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Each sequence of multiply charged ion peaks in the acquired mass spectrum (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) which corresponds to one sample component, is converted into a single peak positioned at the molecular mass (M) in the deconvoluted spectrum (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the deconvoluted spectrum revealed a single peak with a mass of 44.6 kDa corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the scMHC protein. As shown above for the peptide, this was the only identified protein peak in the analyzed spectrum indicating that the protein consists of a very homogenous population of folded complexes. Stoichiometric estimation of the eluted peptide performed according to the mass spectrometry data, revealed that all refolded and purified scMHC molecules are complexed with the peptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Biological Activity of Single-Chain MHC-Peptide Complex: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> A CTL stimulation assay using cloned CTLs specific for the G9-209-2M peptide was utilized to test the biological activity of the scMHC-peptide complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The recombinant purified scMHC complexes that were produced with the 3 different peptides (G9-209-2M, G9-280-9V, and TAX) were immobilized on a microtiter plate and tested for the ability to induce CTL activation. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the single-chain MHC molecule bound to the g9-209-2M peptide induced specific activation of the g209-specific CTL clone R6C12 as determined by interferon-g levels. On the other hand, the complexes bound to the g280 and TAX peptides did not induce specific activation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The ability of soluble scMHC-peptide complexes to induce T cell activation in solution was also tested by generating scMHC-peptide tetramers composed of the scMHC-peptide molecule containing the sequence tag for site-specific biotinylation. Refolded and purified peptide containing scMHC-BirA complexes were biotinylated using the BirA enzyme. Following purification of the scMHC-BirA complexes tetramers were formed by incubation with streptavidin. The biological activity of the scMHC-BirA-peptide tetramers was tested by their ability to activate the corresponding CTL clone. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the tetramers containing the G9-209-2M peptide activated the 209-specific CTL clone R6C12 but not the Mart-i specific CTL clone JB2F4, indicating that the refolded scMHC-peptide complexes are functional and specific. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the ability of the single-chain MHC-BirA-peptide complex to activate the 209-specific CTL clone was tested with or without biotinylation of the scMHC protein and subsequent incubation with streptavidin. As is evident from this Figure, only the biotinylated MHC-BirA-peptide which can form tetrameric complexes activates the 209-specific CTL clone in solution thus T cell activation in solution requires the multimerization of MHC complexes in the form of tetramers which increase the avidity of MHC-TCR interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The tetramer-induced activation of the specific G9-209-2M CTL clone was more efficient compared to the activation induced by high density coating of microtiter plates since tetramers were still able to i o induce specific CTL activation at ng/ml concentrations (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Microscopic observation of the activated CTL clone incubated with the 209-containing MHC tetramers revealed that the cells were agglutinated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). This is due to the significant increase in TCR-MHC avidity and enhanced cell to cell contacts effected by multipoint binding and cross-linking which is caused by the high concentration of MHC tetramers. These morphological effects were peptide specific and dependent on the concentration of the scMHC-BirA-peptide tetramer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). As the concentration of tetramers increased, increased cell agglutination (rosette formation) was observed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> CTLs incubated with unbiotinylated scMHC-BirA-209 complexes and streptavidin which served as a control did not exhibit any morphological appearance indicating of cell agglutination (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> In addition, no agglutinations were observed when the Mart-1 specific CTL clone was incubated with the same concentrations of the g209-specific scMHC tetramer (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The scMHC tetramers also specifically stained CTL clones which recognize the MART-1 specific peptide 27-35. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the scMHC/Mart tetramers specifically recognized a specific CTL clone which was not recognized by the scMHC/TAX tetramers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> ScMHC tetramers were also used to stain a heterogeneous population of T cells from the spleen of transgenic mice (expressing HLA-A2) which were immunized with the TAX peptide. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the number of specific high avidity CD8&plus; T cells increased by 2-fold when non-immunized and immunized mice were compared. Thus, as clearly demonstrated above, the scMHC tetramers generated according to the teachings of the present invention can be utilized to detect and isolate antigen-specific subpopulations of T cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The results presented herein suggest that the recombinant scMHC-peptide complexes generated according to the teachings of the present invention are functional, in both the monomeric and the complexed tetrameric forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Recombinant MHC-peptide tetramers are a very important tool for the molecular characterization of immune responses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Fluorogenic tetramers have been widely used for the characterization of CTL responses and have afforded many advantages over previous techniques, particularly the ability to directly quantify and phenotype Ag-specific CTLs ex-vivo &lsqb;32-35, 38-53&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> It has also been suggested that the enhanced avidity afforded by multimerization of peptide-MHC may allow binding to TCRs with affinities too low to ever generate ligand-induced physiological responses. MHC-peptide tetramers can be utilized in the field of viral infections for direct visualization of antigen-specific CD8&plus; cells in HIV and EBV infection &lsqb;33, 40, 41, 45, 52&rsqb;, animal models of viral infection &lsqb;41-43&rsqb; and direct analysis of viral-specific CD8&plus; cells in patients with human T cell lymphotropic virus-associated myelopathy &lsqb;53&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> MHC-peptide tetramers might also revolutionize the field of anti cancer immunity and immunotherapy since they can be used to identify low frequency anti-tumor CD8&plus; immune responses. This has already been demonstrated for melanoma where there is now considerable evidence that human tumors often express antigens that make them susceptible to lysis by CTLs &lsqb;32, 36, 37, 48, 50&rsqb;. Recently the use of tetrameric soluble class I MHC-peptide complexes for characterizing melanoma-specific CTL ex vivo has been reported &lsqb;36&rsqb;. An important advance in the field of immunotherapy will be the ability to use this technology for adoptive immunotherapy. The use of MHC-peptide tetramers will allow the isolation of CTLs specific for one melanoma epitope from a mixed CTL population using tetramer-driven cell sorting &lsqb;36&rsqb;. Polyclonal CTL lines can be utilized to efficiently lyse autologous tumor cells by generating monoclonal CTL lines against different melanoma epitopes using direct tetramer-driven CTL cloning &lsqb;24, 36&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The ability to efficiently generate recombinant MHC-peptide complexes, with a large variety of antigenic peptides, all related to one disease (for example, melanoma) may lead to improved modes of immunotherapy. Thus, it will enable the simultaneous isolation and cloning of tumor-specific CTL clones specific for the various peptides ex-vivo, accompanied with specific PCR typing of tumor associated peptides expressed by individual patients. The specific clones an then be expanded for adoptive transfer according to the tumor associated antigen (peptide) expression profile of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The availability of recombinant MHC-peptide complexes is of interest not only for the generation of MHC tetramers but also for rapid, sensitive, and reliable MHC-peptide binding assay to identify high affinity MHC binding T cell epitopes. These complexes can be used also in in-vitro primary CTL induction studies to define, among the various MHC binders, those peptides that are immunogenic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> They may be used for CTL in vitro induction as well as for the generation of MHC-peptide tetramers and analysis of specific immune responses or direct selection of CTLs from heterogeneous lymphocyte populations by tetramer-driven cell sorting and analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Recombinant scMHC-peptide complexes can also be used to generate specific antibodies by phage display technology &lsqb;54&rsqb;. Such antibodies with TCR-like specificity can be a valuable tool for studying antigen presentation by tumor cells as well as to develop novel targeting agents for immunotherapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> To date, studies utilizing MHC complexes, some of which are described above, are limited by MHC purification methods which are incapable of producing the required amounts of soluble and functional monomeric or multimeric MHC-peptide complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Thus, the expression method of the present invention provides an invaluable tool for advancing studies with MHC complexes by providing an easy and rapid method for producing large amounts of highly pure and functional monomeric or multimeric scMHC-peptide complexes without the need for arduous and time consuming purification steps such as peptide exchange employed by prior art methods. In addition, the present invention provides a novel human single chain MHC class I polypeptide which is functional in activating CTL clones when utilized as either a monomer or a multimer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the various scMHC constructs described above and any mammalian scMHC class polypeptides can also be co-expressed in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>or any other prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression systems along with the respective binding peptides thereof, thus negating the need for separately providing the binding peptide. Thus according to this method of the present invention, a single construct can be configured so as to express both the scMHC class I polypeptide and respective binding peptide coding sequences in the same cell by utilizing for example two separate promoters or an internal ribosome entry site. Alternatively the cells of the prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression system be co-transformed with two expression constructs each expressing a single coding sequence and each having a specific selection marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Suitable eukaryotic expression systems include, but are not limited to mammalian or insect cell cultures, plant protoplasts, plant cell cultures, whole plants, yeast cells or protozoan cells. It will be appreciated that when expressed in eukaryotic expression systems the produced scMHC class I polypeptide preferably includes a transit peptide (signal sequence) such that the expressed polypeptide is secreted outside the cell (into the apoplast in plant cell cultures or whole plants) so as to avoid interaction with endogenous peptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the construct or constructs must be configured such that the levels of expression of both the scMHC class I polypeptide and the binding peptide thereof are stoichiometrically correct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Thus, a cell which expresses both coding sequences can produce a fully functional scMHC-peptide complex which can be purified via suitable isolation protocols well known in the art. It will be appreciated that a bacterial expression system is especially advantageous in this case since the scMHC-peptide complex expressed thereby can form substantially pure inclusion bodies when suitable expression conditions are employed. Thus, even if the scMHC-peptide complex disassembles under denaturing conditions utilized for solubilizing the inclusion bodies, suitable renaturation conditions can be used so as to reform a functional scMHC-peptide complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims. All publications cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Citation or identification of any reference in this application shall not be construed as an admission that such reference is available as prior art to the present invention. </paragraph>
