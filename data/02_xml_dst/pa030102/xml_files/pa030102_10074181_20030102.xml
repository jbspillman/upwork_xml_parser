<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention provides for new crystal forms of oxcarbazepine, more particularly oxcarbazepine Forms B, C, D and E. The present invention further provides processes for preparation of these forms. Form B is prepared by evaporating the solvents from a solution of oxcarbazepine in toluene and dichloromethane. Form B is also obtained by immediately cooling the solution of oxcarbazepine and toluene. Cooling the same solution at a slower rate, but still fairly rapidly, results in oxcarbazepine Form C. Cooling the same solution at even a slower rate results in another Form, oxcarbazepine Form D. Oxcarbazepine Form E, a solvate of chloroform, is obtained by precipitating a solution of oxcarbazepine and chloroform. The present invention also provides processes for converting one of the newly discovered crystal forms of oxcarbazepine into another crystal form, including Form A, which is in the prior art. These conversions may occur by storage at ambient temperature, by heating one particular Form or treatment with a protic solvent. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> has valuable therapeutic benefits and acts as a central nervous system depressant. Currently it is being marketed as TRILEPTAL&reg;, for treatment of epilepsy. According to the prescribing information for TRILEPTAL&reg;, the pharmacological benefit of oxcarbazepine is primarily exerted through the 10-hydroxy metabolite of oxcarbazepine. In vitro studies indicate that the metabolite blocks voltage sensitive sodium channels, which results in the stabilization of hyperexcited neural membranes, inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing, and diminution of propagation of synaptic impulses. These actions are thought to be important in the prevention of seizure spread in the brain. U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,900, incorporated herein by reference, further teaches the use of oxcarbazepine to treat Parkinson&apos;s disease. TRILEPTAL&reg; is administered in a dosage units of 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,716,640; 4,452,738; 4,559,174 and 5,808,058 are hereby incorporated by reference for their disclosures of processes for preparing oxcarbazepine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the solid state physical properties of oxcarbazepine prepared by any of the disclosed or other methods. These properties can be influenced by controlling the conditions under which the oxcarbazepine is obtained in solid form. Solid state physical properties include, for example, the flowability of the milled solid. Flowability affects the ease with which the material is handled during processing into a pharmaceutical product. When particles of the powdered compound do not flow past each other easily, a formulation specialist must take that fact into account in developing a tablet or capsule formulation, which may necessitate the use of glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, starch or tribasic calcium phosphate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another important solid state property of a pharmaceutical compound is its rate of dissolution in aqueous fluid. The rate of dissolution of an active ingredient in a patient&apos;s stomach fluid can have therapeutic consequences since it imposes an upper limit on the rate at which an orally-administered active ingredient can reach the patient&apos;s bloodstream. The rate of dissolution is also a consideration in formulating syrups, elixirs and other liquid medicaments. The solid state form of a compound may also affect its behavior on compaction and its storage stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These practical physical characteristics are influenced by the conformation and orientation of molecules in the unit cell, which defines a particular crystalline form of a substance. The crystalline form may give rise to thermal behavior different from that of the amorphous material or another polymorphic form. Thermal behavior is measured in the laboratory by such techniques as capillary melting point, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and can be used to distinguish some polymorphic forms from others. A particular polymorphic form may also give rise to distinct spectroscopic properties that may be detectable by powder X-ray crystallography, solid state <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C NMR spectrometry and infrared spectrometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to U.S. Pat. No. 3,716,640, oxcarbazepine may be prepared from 10-methoxy-5H-dibenz&lsqb;b, f&rsqb;azepine-5-carboxamide of formula:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> by hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid. Oxcarbazepine with a melting point of 215-216&deg; C. was obtained after recrystallization from ethanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,174 contains numerous examples of a process of preparing oxcarbazepine via a 5-cyano-10-nitro-5H-dibenz&lsqb;b,f&rsqb;acepine intermediate. In these examples, the product was obtained as a precipitate from the mother liquor and in some instances recrystallized and in other instances washed or slurried with solvent to remove impurities. Solvents from which oxcarbazepine was precipitated or recrystallized are chlorobenzene, acetic acid/water, water, isopropanol, acetonitrile and methanol/water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,058 teaches that oxcarbazepine may be prepared from N-carbamoylization of 10-methoxyminostilbene with sodium or potassium cyanate in the presence of a strong non-aqueous acid, followed by mild aqueous acid hydrolysis of the methoxy group. In the examples, oxcarbazepine was recrystallized from dimethylacetamide, cyclohexanone, ethylcellosolve, 2:1 DMF:water, methanol and dioxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The oxcarbazepine that is formulated into the commercial product TRILEPTAL&reg; is designated herein as oxcarbazepine Form A. Oxcarbazepine Form A is a white to faintly orange crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, acetone and methanol, and practically insoluble in solvents ethanol, ether and water. Due to its low solubility, crystallization of oxcarbazepine from water is impracticable unless the crystallization is carried on from a hot solution. Crystallization from water and various organic solvents such as acetonitrile, THF, ethyl acetate, EtOH/toluene, dichloromethane, DMA, DMF, cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, alcohols, chloroform, water/DMA, DMA/hexane, DMF/EtOH, DMA, and acetone consistently produce the prior art Form A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> There is a need for discovery of accessible but previously unknown polymorphic forms of a pharmaceutically useful compound because it provides a new opportunity to improve the performance characteristics of a pharmaceutical product. It enlarges the repertoire of materials that a formulation scientist has available for designing, for example, a pharmaceutical dosage form of a drug with a targeted release profile or other desired characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Four new polymorphic and pseudopolymorphic forms of oxcarbazepine have now been discovered. They can be differentiated by their powder X-ray diffraction (&ldquo;PXRD&rdquo;) patterns and thermogravimetric analysis (&ldquo;TGA&rdquo;). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As used herein,the term &ldquo;solution&rdquo; refers to a mixture, which preferably is homogeneous. A homogeneous mixture may not result from the initial addition of a solute to a solvent, but only after subsequent heating of the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It has now been found that new crystal forms, differentiated from prior art Form A, can be obtained by crystallization induced by rapid cooling or evaporation of oxcarbazepine solutions in toluene, toluene: dichloromethane mixtures and chloroform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Four novel crystal forms of oxcarbazepine have been isolated and characterized. These forms are distinguished by their PXRD patterns. The DSC profile of all the samples shows a melting peak concomitant to decomposition at about 230&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Generally, in PXRD, compounds can be characterized by the position and intensity of diffraction peaks. However, the intensity of the peaks can differ from sample to sample, due to, among other things, orientation effects. In some crystal habits certain orientations are preferred which enhance some diffraction peaks and reduce others. We describe below as &ldquo;major&rdquo; or &ldquo;strongest&rdquo; peaks the largest peaks in the samples we measured. However, these peaks may not be the largest peaks in some samples or preparations due to the orientation effects. The peak positions, on the other hand, are largely unaffected by orientation effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a novel form of oxcarbazepine designated Form B. The oxcarbazepine Form B may be characterized by a PXRD pattern (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) with peaks at about 11.9, 14.4, 20.0, 23.0, 25.1&plusmn;0.2 degrees two-theta. More particularly, the oxcarbazepine Form B may be characterized by a PXRD pattern with peaks at about 11.9, 14.4, 17.7, 19.4, 20.0, 21.1, 23.0, 24.0, 24.4 ,25.1, 26.0&plusmn;0.2 degrees two-theta. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Form B may be obtained by preparing a solution of oxcarbazepine in dichloromethane, adding the solution to toluene and evaporating the mixed solvent at a controlled rate. Oxcarbazepine is preferably dissolved in dichloromethane in a weight ratio of from about 1:66 to about 1:116, more preferably about 1:110. After dissolution of the oxcarbazepine, toluene is added, preferably in an amount of from about 9.4 ml g<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>dichloromethane to about 12.8 ml g<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>dichloromethane, more preferably about 8.5 ml g<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. Oxcarbazepine crystallizes during evaporation of the solvent mixture into Form B when the solvent is evaporated at from about {fraction (1/30)} to about {fraction (1/50)} of its initial volume per minute, more preferably about {fraction (1/40)} its initial volume per minute. This rate of evaporation can be obtained using a conventional rotary evaporator with aspirator vaccum, without warming the flask. Preferably, oxcarbarzepine is added to the dichloromethane in such a manner that a homogeneous mixture is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Form B may be prepared by an alternative process that comprises the steps of preparing a solution of oxcarbazepine in toluene, heating the solution, cooling the solution at a rate of 60&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>or above to cause formation of a precipitate, and separating the precipitate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Oxcarbazepine is first added to toluene to form a solution, preferably in a ratio of from about 8 mg to about 10 mg oxcarbazepine per gram of toluene. The solution is then heated, preferably to reflux for a sufficient time to substantially dissolve the oxcarbazepine in toluene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The solution is then cooled very rapidly to about 0&deg; C., i.e. at a rate of about 60&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>or faster. Such rapid cooling may be acheived by dipping the sample in salt ice bath at a temperature of &minus;13&deg; C. Rapidly cooling the solution leads to the formation of the apparently kinetically favored product oxcarbazepine Form B. Oxcarbazepine precipitates from the solution in less than about five minutes, and is then separated. Preferably, a filter is used to separate the oxcarbazepine Form B. To filter, the solution may be passed through paper, glass fiber or other membrane material or a clarifying agent such as celite. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Oxcarbazepine is added to toluene to form a solution which is subsequently heated. Preferably, oxcarbazepine is added in an amount of from about 7.3 mg ml<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to about 9.0 mg ml<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, more preferably about 8.1 mg ml<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The solution is preferably heated to from about 25&deg; C. to about reflux, with temperatures at or near reflux being most preferred. One skilled in the art may appreciate that the solution may be completely homogeneous only after the heating step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> After heating for about 10 minutes, the solution is then cooled rapidly. The solution is cooled at a slower rate than is used to obtain Form B, but rapidly enough to allow for the formation of oxcarbazepine Form C as major product. Preferably, the solution is cooled at a rate of about 20&deg; C. to about 60&deg; C. per minute, and most preferably at a rate of about 40&deg; C. per minute.

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The solution is preferably cooled to about 0&deg; C. One skilled in the art may appreciate that other temperatures may also suffice as long as they allow for the substantial formation of Form C. After cooling, a precipitate forms, which is then separated. Preferably, the precipitate is separated with a filter.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a process for preparing oxcarbazepine Form D comprising the steps of preparing a solution of oxcarbazepine in toluene, and evaporating the toluene from the solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Oxcarbazepine is first added to toluene to form a solution. Oxcarbazepine is preferably added in an amount of from about 8.5 to about 9.5 milligrams per gram of toluene, more preferably about 9.1 mg g<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The solution is then preferably heated to completely dissolve the oxcarbazepine. The solution is preferably refluxed for a short amount of time, about five minutes, though a different of temperature and amount of time may also achieve the same result. One skilled in the art may appreciate that the solution may become completely homogeneous only after the heating step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> After heating, the solution is then preferably cooled to decrease the solubility of oxcarbazepine in the toluene. The solution is cooled at a slower rate than the processes resulting in Forms B and C. The solution is cooled at a rate of 20&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and below, more preferably at a rate of about 10&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to about 20&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, and most preferably at a rate of 15&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The solution is cooled in such a way that a precipitate does not substantially form during cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The solution is preferably cooled to from about 0&deg; C. to about room temperature, most preferably to about 0&deg; C. One skilled in the art may appreciate that other temperatures may achieve the same result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> After cooling, the toluene is removed by evaporation. The toluene may be evaporated under ambient or reduced pressure, or optionally heated to accelerate the evaporation. After evaporation, a residue remains which PXRD analysis has confirmed is oxcarbazepine Form D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The process for the preparation of Form B in Example 1 and the process for the preparation of Form D are similar. To prepare Form D, oxcarbazepine is first added to toluene and then the toluene is evaporated. To prepare Form B, oxcarbazepine is first dissolved in dichloromethane and is added to toluene as a solution. The mixed solvent is then removed by evaporation to obtain Form B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides oxcarbazepine as a solvate of chloroform. The oxcarbazepine solvate of the present invention is characterized by a PXRD pattern (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) with peaks at about 14.5, 15.0, 18.2, 21.4, 22.9, 24.0, 25.8, 26.0&plusmn;0.2 degrees two-theta. More particularly, the present invention provides for oxcarbazepine chloroform solvate Form E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> This form contains about 27% solvent, which corresponds to a % solvate of chloroform. The solvent content was measured by TGA, and a weight loss of 27% was seen between 30&deg; C. and 90&deg; C. This desolvatation is also observed in the DSC as an endotherm in the temperature range of about 40&deg; C. to 90&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a process for preparing oxcarbazepine solvate Form E comprising causing formation of a precipitate from a solution of oxcarbazepine and chloroform, and separating the precipitate. The conditions used are different than that of producing Form A by crystallization from chloroform, for instance dissolution at reflux and cooling at 10&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Oxcarbazepine is first dissolved in chloroform to form a solution. Oxcarbazepine is preferably added in an amount of from about 6.8 to about 8.0 milligrams per gram of chloroform, more preferably about 7.3 mg g<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The solution is then preferably heated to increase the amount of oxcarbazepine taken up by the chloroform. Preferably, the solution is completely homogeneous after the heating step. The solution is preferably heated from about 50&deg; C. to about 60&deg; C., and most preferably to about 55&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> After heating, the solution is cooled. Preferably, the solution is cooled to a temperature at or below room temperature. Most preferably, the solution is cooled to about 16&deg; C. The solubility of chloroform for oxcarbazepine decreases as the solution is cooled. To allow the solution to be cooled to a low temperature of about 16&deg; C. without premature precipitation, the solution may first be cooled to a first temperature, and after a while to a second, lower temperature. Preferably, the solution is first cooled to about 25&deg; C., and then to below room temperature. After cooling, a precipitate forms. The precipitate may be separated using a filter. Before filtering, the solution may be allowed to warm. Preferably, the solution is warmed to about 25&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides for processes that convert one form of oxcarbazepine into another form of oxcarbazepine. Form A may be obtained by heating oxcarbazepine solvate Form E at elevated temperatures between 40&deg; C. and 80&deg; C., preferably 60&deg; C., for a period of 2 hours to 10 hours, preferably 4 hours. One skilled in the art may appreciate that Form E may transform to Form A under different conditions, and that the optimal conditions may be discovered with routine experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a process for transforming Form B to Form C. It was found that Form B transforms to Form C at from about 20 to about 30&deg; C., i.e. at about room temperature. The transformation is gradual and prolonged, and may occur over several months. One skilled in the art may appreciate that the optimal conditions and time for transformation may be discovered through routine experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a process for transforming Form B to Form A. At about ambient temperature, Form B transforms to Form C. One skilled in the art would appreciate that such a transition may also occur at temperatures above and below ambient temperature, and that by routine experimentation the boundary of the temperature range may be determined. At higher temperatures, between 60&deg; C. and 120&deg; C., preferably 60&deg; C., a transformation from form B to form A occurs after a few hours, as determined by the temperature. The temperature at which Form B transforms to Form A rather than Form C may be determined by routine experimentation. One skilled in the art may appreciate that the rate and extent of the transformation varies with the conditions and the amount of time under which the transformation occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a process for transforming Forms B, C, and D to Form A. It was found that Forms B, C or D may transform readily to the prior art Form A by slurry in protic solvents like ethanol or water for a period between several hours and several days, preferably for a period of 24 hours. One skilled in the art may appreciate that other protic solvents may be used and the optimal conditions may be determined through routine experimentation. </paragraph>
