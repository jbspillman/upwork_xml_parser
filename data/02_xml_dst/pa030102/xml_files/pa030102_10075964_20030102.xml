<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a computing device. More particularly, the present invention relates to improved features for changing the appearance of a computing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Most computing devices, including portable computers and desktop computers, give feedback to its user via a display screen or speakers. As is generally well known, display screens are used to display textual or graphical information to a user and speakers are used to output sound to the user. For example, display screens may be used to display a graphical user interface (GUI) and speakers may be used to output music or audio messages. Computing devices also give feedback to users via small indicators positioned on the computing device. By way of example, some indicators use light to indicate that a computing device (or the display screen of the computing device) is turned on/off or that a disk drive is reading or writing data to a disk. Although displays, speakers and indicators work well, they are limited to the type of feedback they give a user. For example, while playing a movie with a DVD drive of a computing device, the display screen only outputs the video associated with the movie, the speaker only outputs the audio associated with the movie, and the indicator only indicates that a movie is playing the DVD drive. Thus, it would be desirable to provide additional feedback to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Computing devices also have housings that enclose the components and circuitry associated with operating the computing devices. Housings generally serve to shield and protect the components and circuitry from adverse conditions such as impact and dust. In some cases, the housings are configured to surround all the components of the computing device while in other cases the housings are configured to surround individual or a subset of components. For example, a housing may be used to enclose the central processing unit (CPU), display screen, disk drive, and speaker to form a single unit. As another example, a plurality of different housings may be used to individually enclose the CPU, display screen, disk drive and speakers to form a plurality of individual units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As is generally well known, housings for computing devices in particular product lines are typically manufactured with the same appearance, i.e., they look the same. For example, housings from a particular product line may have the same box-like shape and/or the same neutral color. This can be discouraging to computer users who desire computers that are more personalized or to computer users who desire computers that are different than another user&apos;s computer. Recently, manufacturers have attempted to remedy this problem by offering brightly colored or translucent housings for computing devices. For example, some computer and telephone manufacturers now sell a variety of housings, which have different colors and patterns. By way of example, the iMAC&reg; computer, which is produced by Apple Computer of Cupertino, Calif., is available in various colors and patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although these recent advances make substantial inroads to overcoming the same old appearance, the housings for the computing device remain passive structures that exhibit a non-adaptable or non-changing appearance. That is, a colored or patterned housing has a single color or pattern associated therewith that does not change overtime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> External lights have been used in some devices associated with displaying video to enhance the viewing experience of the video. Unfortunately, however, none of the external lights have been capable of changing the visual appearance of the device housing. That is, the external lights are typically located outside the periphery of the housing and are typically arranged to alter the environment in which the video is shown rather than the device housing itself (the appearance of the housing remains the same even with the use of lights). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for improvements in appearances of housings for computing devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION Of THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The invention pertains to electronic devices capable of changing their ornamental or decorative appearance, i.e., the outer appearance as seen by a user. The electronic devices generally include an illuminable housing. The illuminable housing, which includes at least one wall configured for the passage of light, is configured to enclose, cover and protect a light arrangement as well as functional components of the electronic device. For example, in the case of a desktop computer, the functional components may include a processor for executing instructions and carrying out operations associated with the computer, and in the case of a display monitor, the functional components may include a display for presenting text or graphics to a user. The light arrangement, which generally includes one or more light sources, is configured to produce light for transmission through the light passing wall (or walls) of the illuminable housing. As should be appreciated, the transmitted light illuminates the wall (s) thus giving the wall a new appearance, i.e., the color, pattern, behavior, brightness and/or the like. That is, the transmitted light effectively alters the ornamental or decorative appearance of the electronic device. By way of example, a light source capable of producing green light may cause the light passing wall to exude green. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In most cases, the light is controlled so as Lo produce a light effect having specific characteristics or attributes. As such, the electronic device may be configured to provide additional feedback to the user of the electronic device and to give users the ability to personalize or change the look of their electronic device on an on-going basis. That is, a housing of the electronic device is active rather than passive, i.e., the housing has the ability to adapt and change. For example, the light may be used to exhibit a housing behavior that reflects the desires or moods of the user, that reflects inputs or outputs for the electronic device, or that reacts to tasks or events associated with operation of the electronic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that the present invention may be adapted for any of a number of suitable and known consumer electronic products that perform useful functions via electronic components. By way of example, the consumer electronic products may relate to computing devices and systems that process, send, retrieve and/or store data. The computing devices and systems may generally relate to desktop computers (both segmented and all-in-one machines) that sit on desks, floors or other surfaces, portable computers that can be easily transported by a user, or handheld computing devices. By way of example, portable computers include laptop computers, and handheld computing devices include personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 126</cross-reference>. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a simplified diagram of a chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The word &ldquo;chameleonic&rdquo; refers to the fact that the electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has the ability to alter its visual appearance. The chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally includes a housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> configured to form an external protective covering of the chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a light system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> configured to adjust the illuminance or pigmentation of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> surrounds and protects internal components <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The internal components <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be a plurality of electrical components that provide specific functions for the chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the internal electrical components <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may include devices for generating, transmitting and receiving data associated with operating the electronic device. In one embodiment, the chameleonic electronic device is a component of a computer system, as for example, a general purpose computer. As such, the internal electrical components may include a processor, memory, controllers, I/O devices, displays and/or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured to change its visual appearance via light. That is, the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is configured to allow the passage of light and the light system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is configured to produce light for transmission through the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the light system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a light arrangement (not shown). The light arrangement, which is disposed inside the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and which includes at least one light source, is configured to emit light <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> incident on the inner surface of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As should be appreciated, light <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is transmitted through the wall of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> changes the look of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thus the visual appearance of the chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the light <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may cause the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to exude a specific brightness such as intense or dull light, aspecific color such as green, red or blue, a specific pattern such as a rainbow or dots, or a changing behavior such as a strobe effect or fading in/out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In some cases, the light system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is arranged to cooperate with the electrical components <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For example, events associated with the electrical components <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be monitored, and the light system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be controlled based on the monitored events. As such, an illumination effect corresponding to a specific event may be produced. For example, the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be configured to exude a blinking red coloration when an event has been implemented. Although the light system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may cooperate with the electrical components <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, it should be understood that the electrical components <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the light system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are distinct devices serving different functions. That is, the electrical components <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are generally configured to perform functions relating to operating the chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the light system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is generally configured to change the appearance of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. By way of example, the computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may correspond to the electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generally includes a processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (e.g., CPU or microprocessor) configured to execute instructions and to carry out operations associated with the computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may execute instructions under the control of an operating system or other software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes an input/output (I/O) controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that is operatively coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The I/O controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is generally configured to control interactions with one or more I/O devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that can be coupled to the computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The I/O controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> generally operates by exchanging data between the computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the I/O devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that desire to communicate with the computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In some cases, the I/O devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be connected to the I/O controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through wired connections such as through wires or cables. In other cases, the I/O devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be connected to the I/O controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> through wireless connections. By way of example, the I/O devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be internal or peripheral devices such as memory, disk drives, keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, speakers, video cameras, MP3 playersand the like. The I/O devices <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may also be network-related devices such as network cards or modems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> additionally includes a display controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that that is operatively coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The display controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is configured to process display commands to produce text and graphics on a display device <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be a monochrome display, color graphics adapter (CGA) display, enhanced graphics adapter (EGA) display, variable-graphics-array (VGA) display, super VGA display, liquid crystal display (LCD), cathode ray tube (CRT), plasma displays and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> further includes a light source controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that is operatively coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The light source controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> generally provides processing of light commands from the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to produce light <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in a controlled manner via a light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be one or more light emitting diodes (LED), light emitting semiconductor dies, lasers, incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs, neon tubes, liquid crystal displays (LCD), and the like, that are arranged to produce light and more particularly colored light. The light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is generally disposed inside an enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that covers and protects some aspect of the computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can cover and protect one or more computer components having functionality used in the operation of the computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be configured to cover one or more of the components described above. The enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> generally includes a wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that is configured for transmitting light therethrough. As such, at least a portion of the light <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which is made incident on the wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> via the light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, passes through the wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, thereby producing a light effect <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that alters the visual appearance of the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and thus the visual appearance of the computing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Light effects are generally defined as the way in which the light <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, produced by the light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and controlled by the light source controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, acts or influences the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Metaphorically speaking, the enclosure is the canvas, the light is the paint, and the light effect is the painting. Accordingly, in some cases, the light effect is arranged to cover the entire wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> while in other cases, the light effect is arranged to cover only a portion of the wall <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Light effects may be categorized as static (non-changing over time) or dynamic (changing over time). By way of example, static light effects may cause the enclosure to continuously exude a fixed color such as blue, a fixed shade of a color such as light blue, a fixed pattern or artistic design such as rainbow, stripes, dots, flowers and the like, or a fixed orientation such as a color or pattern located in a specific region of the enclosure. In addition, dynamic light effects may cause the enclosure to exude different colors, intensities or patterns at different times and in different orientations. That is, the coloration, intensities, patterns and position thereof may vary. For example, dynamic light effects may include light effects that change at least partially from a first color, intensity or pattern to a second color, intensity or pattern (e.g., from red to blue to light blue to rainbow, blinking on and off or fading in and out), that change regionally around the enclosure (e.g., moving from a first side to a second side of the enclosure, moving from center to outer, moving around the enclosure in a continuous fashion, a pattern that starts at a certain point on the enclosure and radiates out, etc.), or any combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, computer illumination processing may be performed by the computer system when events associated with the computer system occur in or outside the system. The illumination processing generally provides the computer system with an illumination effect, as for example, the illumination of a housing associated with the computer system. In general, illumination processing includes monitoring events associated with the computer system (e.g., software or hardware) and controlling the light source based on the monitored events so as to provide a housing associated with the computer system with an ornamental appearance corresponding to the monitored event. The events being monitored are generally identified by an operating system or a microprocessor utilized within the computer system. The events can take many forms such as operating system events or microprocessor events. By way of example, the events may relate to signals, conditions or status of the computer system. Examples of illumination processing are described in greater detail in a co-pending patent application entitled, &ldquo;COMPUTING DEVICE WITH DYNAMIC ORNAMENTAL APPEARANCE&rdquo;; (Attorney Docket No.: APL1P218), filed on even date and incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the computer system may include other components such as buses, bridges, connectors, wires, memory, and the like. As is generally well known, buses provide a path for data to travel between components of the computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In addition, bridges serve to perform adjustments necessary to bridge communication between different buses, i.e., various buses follow different standards. Further, memory provides a place to hold data that is being used by the computer system. By way of example, memory may be a Read-Only Memory (ROM) or a Random-Access Memory (RAM). RAM typically provides temporary data storage for use by at least the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and ROM typically stores programming instructions for use with the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the illumination characteristics of the light system that produce the light effects may be determined by predetermined configuration information stored in a database, i.e., the computer system consults the information held in the database in order to determine the illumination characteristics. Illumination characteristics generally refer to how a housing associated with the computer is illuminated to produce an ornamental appearance (e.g., which lights are operated, how long the light sources are operated, what color the light source output, etc.). The predetermined configuration information stored in the database may be accessed by a user through a light control menu, which may be viewed on a display screen as part of a GUI interface. The light control menu may include light control settings pertaining to the illumination characteristics. In fact, the light control menu may serve as a control panel for reviewing and/or customizing the light control settings, i.e., the user may quickly and conveniently review the light control settings and make changes thereto. Once the user saves the changes, the modified light control settings will be employed (e.g., as predetermined configuration information) to handle future illumination processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the placement of the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> relative to the components described above will be described in greater detail. In one embodiment, the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to cover the entire computer system described above. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to cover the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the I/O controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the I/O device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the display controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the light controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to cover only a portion of the computer system described above. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the illuminable enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to cover the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the I/O controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the display controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the light controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the illuminable enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to cover the display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the illuminable enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to cover a peripheral I/O device (e.g., the I/O device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) and the light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can represent a plurality of enclosures that are configured to separately cover individual or sets of components of the computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> described above. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> first enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>A is configured to cover the processor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the I/O controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an internal I/O device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>I, the display controller <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the light controller <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a first light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>A. In addition, a second enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>B is configured to cover the display <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a second light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>B. A third enclosure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>C is configured to cover a peripheral I/O device <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>P and a third light source <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>C. It should be understood that FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are representative embodiments and thus not limitations, thus it should be recognized that other configurations of the enclosure(s) may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the computer system corresponds to a general purpose computer such as an IBM compatible computer or an Apple compatible computer. By way of example, the Apple compatible computer may include different models such as the iMac, G3, G4, Cube, iBook, or Titanium models, which are manufactured by Apple Computer, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a perspective diagram of a general purpose computer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. By way of example, the general purpose computer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may correspond to the computer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> generally includes a base <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and a monitor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> (or display) operatively coupled to the base <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the base <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and monitor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are separate components, i.e., they each have their own housing. That is, the base <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> includes a base housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and the monitor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> includes a monitor housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. Both housings are configured to enclose various internal components associated with operation of the respective devices. In general, the housings <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> serve to surround their internal components at a peripheral region thereof so as to cover and protect their internal components from adverse conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> With regards to the base <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the internal components may be processors, controllers, bridges, memory and the like. Often these internal components take the format of integrated circuits; however, the internal components can take various other forms (e.g., circuit boards, cables, fans, power supplies, batteries, capacitors, resistors). The internal components may also be various I/O devices such as a hard drive, a disk drive, a modem and the like. The base <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may also include a plurality of I/O connectors for allowing connection to peripheral devices such as a mouse, a keyboard, a printer, a scanner, speakers and the like. In the illustrated embodiment, the base housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> serves to surround at least a processor and a controller. By way of example, the controller may be an input/output (I/O) controller, a display controller, a light source controller and/or the like. With regards to the monitor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, the internal components may be a display screen. As is generally well known, the display screen is used to display the graphical user interface (including perhaps a pointer or cursor) as well as other information to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In most cases, the housings <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> include one or more walls <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, respectively, that serve to structurally support the internal components in their assembled position within the housings. The walls <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> also define the shape or form of the housings, i.e., the contour of the walls embody the outward physical appearance of the housings. The contour may be rectilinear, curvilinear or both. In the illustrated embodiment, the base housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> includes six (6) rectangular and planar walls that form a box-shaped housing. It should be understood, however, that this is not a limitation and that the form and shape of the housings may vary according to the specific needs or design of each computer system. By way of example the housing may be formed in simple shapes such as a cube, a cylinder, a pyramid, a cone, or a sphere, or in complex shapes such as a combination of simple shapes or an object such as an apple, a house, a car or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the base housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> includes at least one light passing wall configured to allow the passage of light. In most cases, the light passing wall constitutes a significant percentage area of the housing. In the illustrated embodiment, the entire housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is illuminable and thus all six of the rectangular and planar walls <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> are configured to allow the passage of light. It should be noted, however, that this is not a limitation and that the amount of light passing walls may vary according to the specific needs of each computer system. For example, the housing may include any number of opaque walls and light passing walls. Still further, a light passing wall needed not pass light over its entire surface. In other words, only a non-trivial portion of a wall needs to pass light to be considered a light passing wall. The light passing walls are generally formed from a translucent or semi-translucent medium such as, for example, a clear and/or frosted plastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For ease of discussion, a portion of the wall <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> has been removed to show a light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A disposed inside the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A is configured to generate light <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A so as to illuminate the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, and more particularly the interior of the light passing walls <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The light <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A, which is made incident on the interior of the walls <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> by the light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A, is thereby transmitted through the walls <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to produce a light effect <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>A that alters the visual appearance of the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and thus the visual appearance of the base <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. That is, the light <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A generated inside the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and passing through the walls <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> effectively changes the visual appearance of the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> as seen by a user when looking at the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the light effect <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>A may cause housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to exude a fixed or varying color or pattern. Although a single light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>A is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it should be noted that this is not a limitation and that a plurality of light sources may be used. For example, individual light sources may be strategically positioned within the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> so as to illuminate specific zones or regions of the housing <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the monitor housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> includes at least one light passing wall configured to allow the passage of light. In most cases, the light passing wall constitutes a significant percentage area of the housing. In the illustrated embodiment, the entire housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> is illuminable and thus all of its walls <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are configured to allow the passage of light. It should be noted, however, that this is not a limitation and that the amount of light passing walls may vary according to the specific needs of each computer system. For example, the housing may include any number of opaque walls and light passing walls. Still further, a light passing wall needed not pass light over its entire surface. In other words, only a non-trivial portion of a wall needs to pass light to be considered a light passing wall. The light passing walls are generally formed from a translucent or semi-translucent medium such as, for example, a clear and/or frosted plastic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Again, for ease of discussion, a portion of the wall <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> has been removed to show a light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B disposed inside the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. The light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B is configured to generate light <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>B so as to illuminate the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>, and more particularly the interior of the light passing walls <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The light <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>B, which is made incident on the interior of the walls <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> by the light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B, is thereby transmitted through the walls <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> to produce a light effect <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>B that alters the visual appearance of the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and thus the visual appearance of the monitor <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. That is, the light <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>B generated inside the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and passing through the walls <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> effectively changes the visual appearance of the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> as seen by a user when looking at the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the light effect <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>B may cause housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> to exude a fixed or varying color or pattern. Although a single light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>B is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it should be noted that this is not a limitation and that a plurality of light sources may be used. For example, individual light sources may be strategically positioned within the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> so as to illuminate specific zones or regions of the housing <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a perspective diagram of a general purpose computer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. By way of example, the general purpose computer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may correspond to the computer system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The general purpose computer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes an all in one machine <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> that integrates the base and monitor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> into a single housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is generally configured to enclose various internal components associated with operation of the computer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In general, the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> serves to surround the internal components at a peripheral region thereof so as to cover and protect the internal components from adverse conditions. In one embodiment, the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of cases <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> that cooperate to form the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Any number of cases may be used. In the illustrated embodiment, the cases <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> consist of a bottom case <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>A, a top case <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>B and a front case <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The internal components may be processors, controllers, bridges, memory and the like. Often these internal components take the format of integrated circuits; however, the internal components can take various other forms (e.g., circuit boards, cables, fans, power supplies, batteries, capacitors, resistors). In the illustrated embodiment, the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> serves to surround at least a processor and a controller. By way of example, the controller may be an input/output (I/O) controller, a display controller, a light source controller and/or the like. The internal components may also be various I/O devices such as a hard drive, a disk drive, a modem and the like. For example, as shown, the computer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may include a disk drive <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and a display <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The disk drive <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is used to store and retrieve data via a disk. The display <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is used to display the graphical user interface (including perhaps a pointer or cursor) as well as other information to the user. The all in one machine <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> may also include a plurality of I/O connectors for allowing connection to peripheral devices such as a mouse, a keyboard, a printer, a scanner, speakers and the like. By way of example, the computer system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may include I/O port connectors for connection to peripheral components such as a keyboard <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and a mouse <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The keyboard <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> allows a user of the computer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to enter alphanumeric data. The mouse <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> allows a user to move an input pointer on a graphical user interface and to make selections on the graphical user interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In most cases, the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes one or more walls <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> that serve to structurally support the internal components in their assembled position within the housing. The walls <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> also define the shape or form of the housing, i.e., the contour of the walls embody the outward physical appearance of the housing. The contour may be rectilinear, curvilinear or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> includes one or more light passing walls having light passing portions, which are configured to allow the passage of light. The light passing portions may be an edge of the wall or a surface of the wall. The light passing portions may constitute the an entire wall or a portion of a wall, i.e., a light passing wall need not pass light over its entire surface. In other words, only a nontrivial portion of a wall needs to pass light to be considered a light passing wall. In most cases, the light passing portions constitute a significant percentage area of the light passing wall. For example, the amount of light passing area is generally determined by the amount of light needed to pass through the housing in order to effectively change the appearance of the housing so that a user feels differently about the device (e.g., not an indicator). Any suitable arrangement of light passing walls, light passing portions and opaque walls may be used so long as the outward appearance of the system changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the walls <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>&prime; provided by the top case <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> are light passing walls, which are illuminated with light from a light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> disposed inside the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. For ease of discussion, a portion of the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>&prime; has been removed to show the light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is configured to generate light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> so as to illuminate the interior of the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and more particularly the interior of the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>&prime;. In general, the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, which is made incident on the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>&prime; by the light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, is transmitted through the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>&prime; to produce a light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that alters the visual appearance of the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and thus the visual appearance of the computer system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. That is, the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> generated inside the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and passing through the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>&prime; effectively changes the visual appearance of the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> as seen by a user when looking at the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled to a light source controller (not shown) that cooperates with the light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to produce the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In general, the light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> provides the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> for illuminating the housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, and more particularly the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, and the light source controller provides processing of light commands to produce the light in a controlled manner. In some implementations, the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is arranged to produce the light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> at a surface <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. In other implementations, the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is arranged to produce the light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> at an edge <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. In yet other implementations, the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is arranged to produce a light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> at both the surface <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and the edge <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> To elaborate further, according to one embodiment, the light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is generally configured to include at least one light emitting diode (LED). LED&apos;s offer many advantages over other light sources. For example, LED&apos;s are relatively small devices that are energy efficient and long lasting. LED&apos;s also run relatively cool and are low in cost. Furthermore, LED&apos;s come in various colors such as white, blue, green, red and the like. In most cases, the light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of LED&apos;s that cooperate to produce the desired light effect. The plurality of LED&apos;s may be a plurality of individual LED&apos;s or a plurality of integrated LED arrays having a plurality of individual LED&apos;s that are grouped together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the individual LED&apos;s, whether by themselves or grouped together in an array, are the same color. As such, the same colored LED&apos;s can produce a light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that is one color or at least one shade of one color. This typically can be done by simultaneously maintaining the same light intensity for all of the LED&apos;s via the light source controller. The same colored LED&apos;s can also produce a light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that has a varying coloration. This typically can be accomplished by simultaneously adjusting the light intensities for all of the LED&apos;s at the same time via the light source controller. By way of example, this can be done to produce a light effect that blinks or fades in and out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The same colored LED&apos;s can also produce a light effect that has a pattern with a plurality of different shades of one color. This is typically accomplished by maintaining different light intensities for different LED&apos;s via the light source controller. For example, LED&apos;s positioned in a first spatial zone, i.e., a first area of the illuminable housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, can produce a first shade of color (a first light intensity) and LED&apos;s positioned in a second spatial zone, i.e., a second area of the illuminable housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, can produce a second shade of color (a second light intensity). By way of example, the spatially zoned LED&apos;s can produce a light effect having stripes, spots, quadrants and the like. The same colored LED&apos;s can also produce a light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that has a varying pattern. This is typically accomplished by activating LED&apos;s at different times or by adjusting the intensities of LED&apos;s at different times via the light source controller. For example, same colored LED&apos;s positioned in a first spatial zone can produce a color at a first time and same colored LED&apos;s positioned in a second spatial zone can produce a color at a second time. By way of example, the spatially zoned LED&apos;s can produce a light effect that alternates or moves between different zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, at least a portion of the individual LED&apos;s, whether by themselves or grouped together in an array, are different colors. As such, the different colored LED&apos;s can produce a light effect that is a particular color or at least a shade of a particular color. This typically can be accomplished by mixing different colors of light to produce a resultant color of light via the light source controller. The different colored LED&apos;s can also produce a light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that has a varying coloration. This typically can be accomplished by adjusting the intensity of the different colored LED&apos;s via the light source controller. By way of example, this can be done to produce a light effect that changes from a first color to a second color (e.g., from blue to green). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The different colored LED&apos;s can also produce a light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that has a pattern with a plurality of colors. This typically can be accomplished by activating different colored LED&apos;s or LED arrays, which are located at various locations about the computer system, via the light source controller. For example, LED&apos;s or LED arrays positioned in a first spatial zone, i.e., a first area of the illuminable housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, can produce a first color and LED&apos;s positioned in a second spatial zone, i.e., a second area of the illuminable housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, can produce a second color. By way of example, the spatially zoned LED&apos;s can produce a light effect having rainbow stripes, different colored spots, different colored quadrants and the like. The different colored LED&apos;s can also produce a light effect <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that has a changing pattern. This is typically accomplished by activating different colored LED&apos;s at different times or by adjusting the intensities of different colored LEI)&apos;s at different times via the light source controller. The different colored LED&apos;s may be in the same spatial zone or a different spatial zone. For example, LED&apos;s positioned in a first spatial zone can produce a first colored light at a first time and LED&apos;s positioned in a second spatial zone can produce a second colored light at a second time. This can be done in a specific sequence (e.g., red, blue, red, blue, red, blue . . . ) or a random sequence (e.g., green, yellow, red, yellow, blue . . . ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a simplified diagram of an integrated LED array <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. By way of example, the integrated LED array <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> (or a plurality of LED arrays <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>) may correspond to the light source <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The integrated LED array <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> generally includes a plurality of individual LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> that produce an overall light effect that is one color at a moment in time. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the individual LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> represents a different color, as for example, a red LED <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>A, a green LED <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>B and a blue LED <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>C, that cooperate to produce a resultant color C. It is generally believed that these three colors are the primary colors of light and therefore they can be mixed to produce almost any color. That is, the resultant color C may be a wide range of colors, as for example, a majority of the colors from the color spectrum. Although only one LED is shown for each color, it should be noted that this is not a requirement and that the number may vary according to the specific needs of each device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> To facilitate discussion, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> is a three dimensional graphical representation showing color mixing with regards to the red, green and blue LED&apos;s (<highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>A-C). As shown, red light produced by the red LED <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>A is designated R, green light produced by the green LED <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>B is designated G, and blue light produced by the blue LED <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>C is designated B. Furthermore, mixed light produced by the red and green LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>A&amp;B is designated RG, mixed light produced by the green and blue LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>B&amp;C is designated GB, and mixed light produced by the blue and red LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>A&amp;C is designated BR. Moreover, mixed light produced by the red, green and blue LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>A-C is designated W (for white). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> (a two dimensional graphical representation showing color mixing with regards to the red, green and blue LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>A-C) each of the colors has a range of intensities (I) between a peak intensity <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and a zero intensity <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. As such, the light source controller can produced almost any color by adjusting the intensity (I) of each of the LED&apos;s (<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>A-C). By way of example, in order to produce the highest shade of red R, the intensities of the green G and blue B are reduced to zero intensity <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> and the intensity of the red R is increased to its peak intensity <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The highest shades of green and blue can be implemented in a similar manner. In addition, in order to produce a shade of red and green RG, the intensities of the green G and red R are increased to levels above zero intensity <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> while the intensity of blue B is reduced to zero intensity <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. Shades of green and blue GB and blue and red BR can be implemented in a similar manner. Furthermore, in order to produce shades of white, the intensities of the red R, green G and blue B are increased to the same levels above zero intensity <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Although the integrated LED array <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is shown and described as using the three primary colors, it should be noted that this is not a limitation and that other combinations may be used. For example, the integrated LED array may be configured to include only two of the primary colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a perspective diagram of a computer system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. By way of example, the computer system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may generally correspond to the computer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The computer system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> generally includes an illuminable housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> that is illuminated with light from a light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The illuminable housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> generally includes a translucent or semi-translucent wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> configured to allow the passage of light. For ease of discussion, a portion of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> has been removed to show the light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is generally configured to generate light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> so as to illuminate a surface of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> of the illuminable housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. That is, the light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> emitted by the light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is made incident on an inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> then passes through the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (width wise) to an outer surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> where it produces a light effect <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> that alters the visual appearance of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and thus the visual appearance of the computer system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a characteristic glow is produced at the outer surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> when the light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is transmitted through the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. By characteristic glow, it is meant that the coloration of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> emanates from the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> rather than from the light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, i.e., the light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is altered during transmission through the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. In most cases, the characteristic glow is produced by a light directing element disposed in or on the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The light directing element is generally configured to scatter incident light by reflection and/or refraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To facilitate discussion, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a top view, in cross section, of the computer system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As shown, the light source <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> consists of a plurality of light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> (LED&apos;s) that are disposed at various positions inside the illuminable housing <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> may be a single LED <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>A or an LED array <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>B. The LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> may be positioned in various directions so long as the light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is made incident on the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. For example, the axis of the LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> may be pointing directly at the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> or they may be pointing at an angle relative to the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is configured to transmit the light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> therethrough from the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to an outer surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be formed from a translucent or semi-translucent plastic such as polycarbonate, acrylic and the like. In most cases, the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is also configured to scatter the transmitted light to produce a characteristic glow <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> that emanates from the outer surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. For instance, the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may include a light directing element <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> (shown by dotted line) that scatters the light via reflection and/or refraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the light directing element <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is an additive that is disposed inside the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, for example, the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of light scattering particles <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> (e.g., additives) dispersed between the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and outer surface <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. As shown, when the light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is made incident on the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, it is transmitted through the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> until is intersects a light scattering particle <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> disposed inside the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. After intersecting the light scattering particle <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, the light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is scattered outwards in a plurality of directions, i.e., the light is reflected off the surface and/or refracted through the light scattering particle thereby creating the characteristic glow <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the light scattering particles <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> may be formed from small glass particles or white pigments. Furthermore, by changing the amount of light scattering particles <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> disposed in the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the characteristics of the glow can be altered, i.e., the greater the particles the greater the light scattering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the light directing element <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is a layer, coating or texture that is applied to the inner or outer surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14B and 14C</cross-reference>, for example, the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may include a light scattering coating <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> or a light scattering texture <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> disposed on the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the light scattering coating <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may be a paint, film or spray coating. In addition, the light scattering texture <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> may be a molded surface of the wall or a sandblasted surface of the wall. As shown, when light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is made incident on the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, it intersects the light scattering coating <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> or texture applied on the inner surface <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. After intersecting the light scattering coating <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> or the light scattering texture <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, the light <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is scattered outwards in a plurality of directions, i.e., the light is reflected off the surface and/or refracted through the light scattering particle thereby creating the characteristic glow <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Although not shown, in another embodiment, the thickness of the wall may be altered so as to produce a light scattering effect. It is generally believed that the greater the thickness, the greater the light scattering effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a perspective diagram of a computer system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. By way of example, the computer system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may generally correspond to the computer <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The desktop computer system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> generally includes an illuminable housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> that is illuminated with light from a light source <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The illuminable housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> generally includes a translucent or semi-translucent wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> configured to allow the passage of light. For ease of discussion, a portion of the wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> has been removed to show the light source <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The light source <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> is generally configured to generate light <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> so as to illuminate an edge of the wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> of the illuminable housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. That is, the light <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> emitted by the light source <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> is made incident on an inner edge <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. The light is then directed through the wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> (length wise) to an outer edge <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> where it produces a light effect <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> that alters the visual appearance of the wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and thus the visual appearance of the computer system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In essence, the wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> acts like a light pipe that is configured for transferring or transporting light. Light pipes are generally well known in the art. </paragraph>

As shown, the light source <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> consists of a plurality of light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> (LED&apos;s) that are disposed at various positions inside the illuminable housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> may be a single LED or an LED array. The LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> may be positioned in various directions so long as the light <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is made incident on the inner edge <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the wall <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the wall <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is configured to transmit the light effect <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> therethrough from the inner surface <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to an outer surface <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, i.e., the wall provides a window for passing the first light effect therethrough. By way of example, the wall <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may be formed from a translucent or semi-translucent plastic such as polycarbonate, acrylic and the like. Accordingly, the first light effect <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> that passes through the wall <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> effectively changes the appearance of the computing device <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In some cases, the wall <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may also be configured to scatter the transmitted light effect to produce a characteristic glow that emanates from the outer surface of the wall <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. That is, the wall <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may include a light directing element that scatters the light via reflection and/or refraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> To elaborate further, the illuminated object <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> generally includes a light source <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and a casing <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. The casing <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, which typically forms the shape of the illuminated object <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, includes a casing wall <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> that is configured to cover at least a portion of the light source <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a side view of a light source arrangement <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. By way of example, the light source arrangement <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may generally correspond to any of the light sources (e.g., light emitting devices) described above. The light source arrangement <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> includes a light source <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> and a light pipe <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight>. The light source <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> is configured to generate light <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> and the light pipe <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is configured to distribute the light <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> to locations within a housing where it is needed. By way of example, the housing may correspond to any one of the illuminable housings described above. The light pipe <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> generally includes a transmissive portion <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight> at its interior and a reflective portion <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> at its exterior. Because the exterior of the light pipe <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> is reflective, the light <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> reflects off the sides of the pipe as it travels through the interior of the light pipe. Accordingly, when light <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight> is made incident on an inner edge <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> of the light pipe it is directed through the light pipe via the transmissive and reflective portions to an outer edge <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> of the light pipe where it emits the light to another location positioned away from the location of the light source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Any suitable light pipe may be used. For example, the light pipe may be rigid or flexible (as shown). Flexible light pipes allow a wider range of light source positions relative to housing positions. For example, the light source may positioned in locations that prevent direct exposure to an illuminable portion of the housing, and thus the light pipe may be used to distribute the light to the illuminable portions of the housing by bending around components that prevent direct exposure (e.g., walls, frames and the like). In one embodiment, the light source is housed within an opaque portion of the housing, and a light pipe is used to direct light to an illuminable portion of the housing so as to produce the desired light effect. Furthermore, multiple light pipes may be used to direct light to a plurality of locations around the housing. This may be done with a single light source or multiple light sources. For example, a single light source may be used to provide light to a plurality of light pipes, each of which has one end position proximate the light source and an opposite end positioned in different locations within the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is a side view of a light source arrangement <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. By way of example, the light source arrangement <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may generally correspond to any of the light sources (e.g., light emitting devices) described above. The light source arrangement <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a light guide <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, which is configured to focus light <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> generated by the light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The light guide <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, which covers a portion of the light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, is typically formed from an opaque material such that the light <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> emanating from the light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is only directed out of an opening <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> formed by the light guide <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the light exiting the opening has a shaped configuration that is more intense. The shaped configuration tends to illuminate a smaller portion of the housing than would otherwise be illuminated. The opening <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> may form any number of shapes. For example, the opening may form a circle, an oval, a square, a rectangle, a triangle, a letter, a logo or any other shape. In this particular embodiment, the light guide <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is configured to cover the sides of the light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. In some cases, it may be desirable to use a light guide to block light from reaching light sensitive areas of the electronic device or to prevent heat sensitive areas from becoming to hot. </paragraph>

By way of example, the light source arrangement <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may generally correspond to any of the light sources (e.g., light emitting devices) described above. The light source arrangement <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> includes a light source <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and a lens <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, which is configured to focus light <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> generated by the light source <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. The lens <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, which is typically positioned between the light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and the illuminable wall (not shown), is arranged to receive light emanating from the light source <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and to direct the light to a specific area of the illuminable wall. In this manner, the light has a shaped configuration that is more intense. As mentioned above, the shaped configuration tends to illuminate a smaller portion of the housing than would otherwise be illuminated. </paragraph>

By way of example, the computer system <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may generally correspond to any of the computer systems described above. As shown, the computer system <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> and a light source <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> disposed therein. In the illustrated embodiment, the housing <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> consists of three parts: end cap <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>A, a body <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>B and a front face <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>C. The end cap <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>A closes off one side of the body <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>B and the front face <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>C closes off another side of the body <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>B. Any suitable arrangement of light passing and light blocking walls may be used. In the illustrated embodiment, the end cap <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>A and front face <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>C are typically formed from a light blocking material while the body <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>B is formed from a material that allows the passage of light (e.g., translucent or semi-translucent material). The computer system <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> also includes a reflector <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> is positioned between the light source <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> (which is located towards the end cap <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>A) and the front face <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> C. In the illustrated embodiment, the reflector <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> is positioned in front of a display <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>. The reflector <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> is configured to redirect the light <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> generated by the light emitting device <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>. As shown, the light <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> from the light emitting device <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> is reflected off the surface of the reflector <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> to a first portion <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>B. The first portion is defined by B. The reflected light <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> made incident on the inner surface of the body <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>B is subsequently transmitted through the wall of the body <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>B and out the outer surface of the first portion <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>B at the portion <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a simplified diagram of a chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. By way of example, the chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may generally correspond to the chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The chameleonic electronic device <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> generally includes a housing <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> that is divided into several independent and spatially distinct illuminable zones <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. As shown, the zones <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> are positioned around the periphery of the housing <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>. The periphery may correspond to any portion of the housing such as the top, bottom, and sides of the housing. Any number of zones may be used. In the illustrated embodiment, the housing <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> includes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> illuminable zones <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. Each of the zones <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> has an associated light element <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight>, which is disposed inside the housing <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight> proximate the zone <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. As should be appreciated, the associated light element <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> is configured to light up its corresponding zone <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> so as to change the ornamental appearance of the housing. By way of example, the associated light element may be an LED array capable of illuminating the corresponding zone with a plurality of colors (e.g., the LED array may include a red, green and blue LED). As shown, each of the zones <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight> is configured to provide a light output <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The zones may be configured to produce a variety of ornamental appearances. In one embodiment, the zones are arranged to produce a uniform ornamental appearance. This is generally accomplished by sending the same light command signal to each of the light elements. For example, each of the zones may produce the same green light output so as to produce a uniform green housing. In another embodiment, the zones are arranged to produce a patterned ornamental appearance. This is generally accomplished by sending different light command signals to the light elements. For example, a first set of alternating zones may produce a red light output, and a second set of alternating zones may produce a blue light output in order to produce a housing with stripes. In another embodiment, the zones are arranged to produce a changing ornamental appearance. This is generally accomplished by sending different light command signals to the light elements at different times. For example, each of the zones may be arranged to activate at different times to produce a light sequence such as blinking, fading in and out, strobes or moving from one zone to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a broken away diagram of a general purpose computer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The general purpose computer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> which encloses internal components <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> associated with operating the general purpose computer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>, which includes several walls that define the peripheral form of the housing, is broken away between a top and a bottom so as to show the internal components therein. As shown, the internal components <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> may include a motherboard <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> that supports a CPU <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, RAM <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight>, a hard drive <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight>, a disk drive <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight>, expansion slots and boards <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>, and the like. The internal components <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> may also include a power supply <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> and other associated circuitry such as heat sinks <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> and fans <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> for cooling the internal components <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> may also include a plurality of ports <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> for connection to peripheral devices located outside the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. In addition, the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> may include an indicator <highlight><bold>477</bold></highlight> and a power switch <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight>. In some cases, a monitor may be one of the internal components <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The internal components <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> may also include one or more light emitting diodes (LED&apos;s) <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. The LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> are generally configured to generate light within the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may generate light found within the color spectrum. The light is used to colorize or patternize the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. This is generally accomplished by directing the light through illuminable portions of the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. That is, the LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> produce light having a variety or colors and patterns so as to give the illuminable portions of the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> a color or pattern. In one embodiment, the illuminable portions are capable of diffusing the light so that the illuminable portions appear to glow when light is directed therethrough. The LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may be disposed centrally, peripherally or both so as to allow the light to reach the illuminable portions of the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. For example, although the LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> are centrally located in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may be disposed closer to the walls of the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> so as to circumvent light blocking components contained within the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. The LED&apos;s <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may be controlled by a separate processor or by the CPU <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> that also controls the operation of the general purpose computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The size of the illuminable portion generally constitutes a substantial portion of the entire housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. By substantial, it is meant that the area of the illuminable portion is large enough to effect the overall appearance of the general purpose computer <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> when light is passed therein. In essence, the LED&apos;s are dedicated to altering the appearance of the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> so that people may break free from the neutral-passive colors and patterns that have dominated the housings of general purpose computers for so long. In one embodiment, the illuminable portion covers the entire housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the illuminable portion covers one or more walls of the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> (in their entirety). In another embodiment, the illuminable portion covers a part of two or more walls of the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the illuminable portion covers a significant part of a wall of the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the area of the illuminable portion is substantially larger than any of the switches, connectors or indicators located on the housing <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. These type of devices are typically too small to effect the overall appearance of the general purpose computer. That is, they typically do not cover a significant part of the wall to which they are attached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is directed at a general purpose computer, it should be appreciated that LED&apos;s may be placed in other devices associated with the general purpose computer. For example, LED&apos;s may be placed in housings of peripheral devices such as input devices (e.g., mice) or output devices (e.g., speakers) that are connected to the general purpose computer. In the case of input devices, the input devices are arranged to serve its primary function of inputting data while communicating other data via the LED&apos;s. In the case of output devices, the output devices are arranged to serve their primary function of outputting data while communicating other data via the LED&apos;s. In either case, the LED&apos;s may be controlled by the main CPU of the general purpose computer or a separate processor of the general purpose computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in terms of several preferred embodiments, there are alterations, permutations, and equivalents, which fall within the scope of this invention. It should also be noted that there are many alternative ways of implementing the methods and apparatuses of the present invention. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims be interpreted as including all such alterations, permutations, and equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
