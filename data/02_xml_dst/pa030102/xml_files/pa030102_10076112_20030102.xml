The disclosure of the above-mentioned provisional application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</paragraph>
</cross-reference-to-related-applications>
<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to systems for heating medical items. In particular, the present invention pertains to a system for heating and maintaining medical solutions (e.g., bags or containers containing saline or intravenous (IV) solutions, antibiotics or other drugs, blood, etc.) at desired temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various types of medical items require heating to a selected temperature prior to utilization in a medical procedure. In particular, medical items, such as intravenous (IV) fluid bags, are typically heated to precise temperatures to prevent thermal shock and injury from occurring during infusion of such IV fluid into a patient. In order to provide the necessary heated items for use in certain medical procedures, medical personnel typically utilize a warming system to heat items toward their operational temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The related art has provided several variations of warming systems for heating medical or other items to desired operational temperatures. For example, ovens may be disposed within operating rooms to heat items to desired temperatures. Further, U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,568 (Van Overloop) discloses a wet dressings heater having a base with side walls defining a cavity, and an insert connected to the base and defining at least one recess in the cavity for receiving wet dressings. A heater has an electrical heating element in close proximity to the insert recess for heating the wet dressings, while the temperature of the heating element is controlled in a desired temperature range for those wet dressings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,402 (Burdick et al) discloses a warmer for heating wet dressings and other articles disposed within a heating and storage compartment. The articles are arranged within the compartment in stacked relation and disposed on a plate that is supplied with thermal energy from a heater. The plate includes a center aperture whereby a first thermal sensor is disposed in the aperture in contact with a bottommost article. Control circuitry is disposed beneath the plate to control the heater to maintain temperature of the bottommost article at a desired level based on the temperatures sensed by the first thermal sensor and a second thermal sensor responsive to heater temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,408,576 (Bishop) discloses an intravenous fluid warmer having a cabinet structure to accommodate a plurality of intravenous fluid bags. A temperature sensor and pad of heating filaments are disposed within the cabinet structure, whereby the temperature sensor enables automatic temperature regulation of the pad of heating filaments to heat the intravenous fluid bags. The heating filaments are covered by a rubber layer to prevent melting of the bags during heating. A temperature indicator disposed on the cabinet structure permits a user to ascertain when a desired temperature is attained, whereby an intravenous fluid bag is removed from the intravenous fluid warmer via an opening defined in a side of the cabinet structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,986,239 (Corrigan, III et al.) discloses a conductive warmer for flexible plastic bags. The warmer includes a heat-conducting member of thermally conductive material having a plurality of fins which are parallel and spaced apart to define a plurality of bag-receiving compartments. The fins are connected to a back portion of the heat-conducting member to which a heating element is attached in a heat-exchanging relationship. The heating element conducts heat through the back portion and fins of the heat-conducting member to the bags. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The warming systems described above suffer from several disadvantages. In particular, ovens typically do not have a high degree of accuracy or control, thereby enabling use of items having temperatures incompatible with a medical procedure and possibly causing injury to a patient. Further, ovens or other warming systems employed in the operating room generally require a substantial time interval to heat items to desired temperatures. This either delays the medical procedure or requires the additional task or preheating the items well in advance of commencing the procedure. The Burdick et al and Bishop warmers employ heaters that generally contact a particular portion of an article being heated, thereby heating articles in an uneven manner and enabling formation of hot spots. Moreover, the Burdick et al, Bishop, Corrigan, III et al and Van Overloop warming systems employ a heating element covering a substantial portion of a conducting member, thereby increasing system costs and power usage. In addition, the above described systems do not control operation based on detection of the presence of items placed within the systems. This enables the systems to operate absent items placed therein, thereby needlessly consuming power and facilitating potential damage to system heating or other components. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to rapidly heat a medical item to a desired temperature in preparation for use of that medical item in a medical procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to heat a medical item to a desired temperature by uniformly distributing heat about the medical item, thereby avoiding creation of &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; and &ldquo;cold spots&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to directly measure a temperature of a medical item being heated to effectively control heating of the medical item to the desired temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to automatically enable a heater in a warming system in response to the presence of the medical item within the warming system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to evenly distribute heat about a medical item within a warming system by conducting heat through a heating plate that at least partially surrounds the medical item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to facilitate loading of a plurality of medical items within a warming system housing for heating to desired temperatures prior to use in medical procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The aforesaid objects may be achieved individually and/or in combination, and it is not intended that the present invention be construed as requiring two or more of the objects to be combined unless expressly required by the claims attached hereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a temperature controlled system includes a system housing with a compartment defined therein. The compartment includes a heating assembly with a generally &lsquo;U&rsquo;-shaped heating plate and corresponding heater. The heating plate is configured to evenly distribute heat to a medical item (e.g., a medical solution container, etc.) placed thereon, while a limit switch facilitates control of power to the heater. The limit switch is typically positioned near a bearing surface of the heating plate to enable a limit switch arm to directly contact medical solution containers placed on the heating plate. The limit switch facilitates heater actuation in response to placement of a medical item on the heating plate. A temperature sensor measures the temperature of solutions disposed within the housing compartment, and is preferably positioned on the limit switch arm to directly contact a medical solution container. A system controller facilitates entry of desired temperatures and controls the heating assembly based on a comparison of the desired temperature with the temperature measured by the temperature sensor. The controller includes a display for indicating the solution temperature. In one embodiment of the present invention, the system housing includes a heating compartment for heating medical solution containers and a storage compartment for receiving and retaining medical solution containers prior to being heated within the heating compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention overcomes the aforementioned problems and provides several advantages. For example, the warming system of the present invention distributes heat evenly to one or more medical items of varying shapes and sizes, thereby ensuring rapid and relatively uniform heating and the elimination of potential &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; or &ldquo;cold spots&rdquo; for the items. Further, the warming system of the present invention provides a temperature sensor that directly measures the temperature of medical items disposed within the system, thereby providing an accurate temperature indication of those medical items and enhanced temperature control. Moreover, the present invention includes a switch to autonomously enable the heater in response to a medical item being disposed on the heating plate. This ensures that heating within the system only occurs when medical items are disposed on the heating plate so as to render the system energy efficient and promote longevity of the heating element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The above and still further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of specific embodiments thereof, particularly when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals in the various figures are utilized to designate like components.</paragraph>

A door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is disposed on the housing to cover a housing open portion that facilitates placement and removal of items within the housing as described below. Front and rear walls <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are substantially rectangular and are attached to and extend between side walls <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Front wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a height substantially less than that of rear wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Bottom wall <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular and is attached to the front, rear and side wall bottom edges. Top wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular and is attached to rear wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and side wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The top wall extends from side wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for a distance substantially less than the distance between the side walls to partially define the housing open portion between the top wall and side wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The top wall further extends from rear wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for a distance less than the distance between the front and rear walls. Side walls <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are generally rectangular with respective truncated upper front corner sections. The truncated section of side wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes an angled edge that extends between front wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and top wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The truncated section of side wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> includes a similarly angled edge. </paragraph>

The control panel is substantially rectangular and is attached to top wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, front wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the angled edge of side wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The control panel has a transverse dimension similar to that of the top wall and is oriented at an angle toward rear wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> similar to that of the angled side wall edge. Projection <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is substantially rectangular and is attached to front wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a control panel lower section and side wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The projection extends from the front wall toward the rear wall for a slight distance and is oriented at an angle similar to that of control panel <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The open area between control panel <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, side wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and projection <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> defines the remaining area of the housing open portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A control assembly is typically disposed on control panel <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The control assembly includes a power switch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and a controller<highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to indicate solution temperature and control operation of the system as described below. Controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> includes a display <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> (e.g., LED or LCD) and a plurality of input devices or buttons <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The input devices are manipulable by a user to enable entry of a desired or set point temperature for a medical solution container placed within the housing compartment. Display <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> typically displays the measured temperature of the solution and may further be directed, via the input devices, to display the desired or set point temperature. It is to be understood that the terms &ldquo;top&rdquo;, &ldquo;bottom&rdquo;, &ldquo;side&rdquo;, &ldquo;front&rdquo;, &ldquo;rear&rdquo;, &ldquo;upper&rdquo;, &ldquo;lower&rdquo;, &ldquo;vertical&rdquo;, &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo;, &ldquo;height&rdquo;, &ldquo;width&rdquo;, &ldquo;length&rdquo; and the like are used herein merely to describe points of reference and do not limit the present invention to any specific orientation or configuration. The system housing and components (e.g., walls, panels, etc.) may be of any size, shape or configuration suitable for operation of the system and may be constructed of any suitable materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provides access to the housing compartment and covers the housing open portion. The door includes an upper section that is configured to cover the housing open portion defined between top wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and side wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and a lower section configured to cover the housing open portion defined between control panel <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, projection <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> and side wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Thus, the door lower section is typically angled in a manner similar to that of the control panel and projection. The door upper and lower sections maybe pivotally connected or may be joined at an angle to accommodate the angled configuration of the housing front panel. Door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is preferably pivotally connected to rear wall <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and opens away from the front panel and top wall to expose the housing compartment and facilitate placement and removal of medical solution containers within the system. A system with door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in an open state and a medical solution container <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> placed within the housing interior compartment is illustrated, by way of example only, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The door may be of any size or shape and may open in any direction or manner with respect to the housing suitable for operation of the system. Door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may further include a handle (not shown) disposed at any suitable location (e.g., toward a door side or bottom edge). The handle may be implemented by any conventional or other type of handle. Alternatively, the door may include a latching mechanism of any conventional or other configuration that facilitates manual or automatic opening of the door via an unlatching activation member (e.g., a button located on the upper front panel of the housing that is depressed to unlatch the door). The door is typically constructed of a transparent material, such as glass or plexiglass, to allow viewing of the housing compartment when the door is in a closed state. However, the door may be constructed of any suitably sturdy materials, with a portion of the door preferably including a window or other viewing area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An exemplary heating assembly employed by the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Specifically, heating assembly <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes a heating plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and a heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. Heating plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is typically located at the bottom of the housing compartment and includes a bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The heating plate bottom and side walls are each substantially rectangular with the side walls extending at an angle from opposing bottom wall longer dimensioned side edges toward the interior surfaces of the housing front and rear walls to form a generally &lsquo;U&rsquo;-shaped heating plate configuration. The heating plate bottom wall typically receives medical solution containers, while the heating plate bottom and side walls conduct heat from heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to provide uniform heat distribution to those containers. Thus, heat is simultaneously applied to three sides of the container. The heating plate is preferably constructed of a thermally conductive material, while heat is conducted from one plate wall in contact with the heater to the remaining plate walls to distribute heat to the medical solution container placed on the heating plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is disposed on the underside of heating plate bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The heater applies heat to bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> which, in turn, distributes heat to the plate side walls and medical solution container placed on the heating plate. This arrangement facilitates rapid heating of the medical item to a desired temperature which is especially advantageous during employment of the system in time critical situations, such as in an operating room. For example, the system may heat items to a desired temperature in the approximate range of 80&deg; F. to 150&deg; F. within a short time interval, generally within one hour (e.g., the particular time interval depends on various factors, such as initial item temperature, room temperature, selected desired temperature, etc.). Controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is electrically coupled to the heater to control the heater in response to a measured solution temperature as described below. Heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is generally rectangular and preferably configured to cover a portion of the heating plate bottom wall. The heater is typically implemented by a conventional etched foil silicon rubber heating pad, and is attached to the underside of bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> via a pressure sensitive or other type of adhesive. The heater may alternatively be of any quantity (e.g., at least one), shape or size, and may include any configuration (e.g., strips, bars, segments, etc.) that covers the entirety or any portion of the heating plate. In addition, the heater may be implemented by any conventional or other type of heater or heating element (e.g., heating coils, etc.) that may be disposed on the heating plate at any suitable locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The heating assembly further includes a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and a limit switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> that controls heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in response to detection of the presence of medical solution containers on the heating plate. The temperature sensor is typically in direct contact with a medical solution container to provide a highly accurate temperature indication for the medical solution contained within that container. Temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is positioned above the bearing surface of heating plate bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> as described below, and directly measures the temperature of a medical solution container placed on the heating plate. The temperature sensor is preferably implemented by a conventional resistive temperature device (RTD) (e.g., 1,000 Ohm RTD). However, the temperature sensor may be implemented by any conventional or other type of temperature sensor, and maybe disposed at any suitable location on the heating plate or within the compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, limit switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> controls heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in response to placement and removal of medical solution containers on the heating plate. Specifically, the limit switch is typically implemented in the form of a pressure type switch that enables or disables the heater in response to detection of pressure (e.g., the weight of a container) applied to a portion of the heating plate. However, the limit switch may alternatively be configured in any manner suitable for operation of the system. The limit switch includes a housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and an arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The limit switch housing is disposed beneath the heating plate bottom wall and includes a post or support member <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> extending from the housing top surface toward the heating plate. Arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is attached in a cantilevered manner to support member <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. The arm includes a receptacle <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> disposed at the arm proximal end to receive the support member and facilitate attachment of the arm thereto. Temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is mounted on arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> toward the arm distal end with wiring <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> extending from the sensor to controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) as described below. The arm extends from the support member along the underside of the heating plate bottom wall to align sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> with an opening (not shown) defined in the heating plate bottom wall. The bottom wall opening provides temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> with access to a medical solution container placed on the heating plate. The limit switch arm is constructed of a resilient material that biases the arm toward the heating plate and enables the arm to move between that plate and the limit switch housing. The arm bias further forces the temperature sensor against a medical solution container placed on the heating plate, thereby facilitating an accurate temperature measurement. A contact member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) is disposed on housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> coincident a distal portion of the limit switch arm and extends into the limit switch housing via an opening (not shown) defined in that housing. The contact member is typically directly attached to or resiliently biased toward the limit switch arm to enable movement of the contact member into or out of the limit switch housing in response to flexing of the limit switch arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The contact member is configured to actuate switch circuitry <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> disposed within the limit switch housing. In particular, the limit switch arm flexes toward the limit switch housing in response to pressure applied to the arm from a medical solution container placed on the heating plate. Contact member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is subsequently urged into housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and interfaces control circuitry <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight>. This motion results in actuation of the switch circuitry and effectively closes switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. When a container is removed from the heating plate, arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is biased toward the heating plate bottom wall with the contact member being withdrawn from the switch circuitry. This motion effectively results in disablement of the switch circuitry and effectively opens switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, thereby disabling the heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The limit switch controls the heater in response to detection of the presence of a medical solution container on the heating plate as illustrated, byway of example only, in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Specifically, when no medical solution container is present on the heating plate, limit switch arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is biased toward the heating plate (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) with contact member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> withdrawn from limit switch housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (e.g., the contact member is withdrawn from the switch circuitry). The limit switch is effectively in an open state, thereby disabling heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> as described above. When a medical solution container <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is placed within the compartment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), the container contacts sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and forces limit switch arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to flex toward limit switch housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The flexion of the limit switch arm forces contact member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> to extend within the limit switch housing to actuate switch circuitry <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> and effectively close switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling the heater as described above. Removal of container <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the compartment restores the limit switch arm to the initial biased position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), thereby disabling the heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is disposed on arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and provides a temperature measurement to controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for control of the heater as described above. A temperature cut-out switch may further be employed by the heating assembly and disposed on arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> basically disables current to heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in response to a temperature measurement exceeding a temperature threshold. In other words, the cut-out switch disables the heater in response to detection of excessive heater temperatures. The cut-out switch may be implemented by any conventional switching type or limiting devices, such as a high limit thermostat, and may be disposed at any suitable location. Specifically, limit switch arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> includes temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is disposed toward the limit switch arm distal end, while cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacent sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and serves to disable operation of the heater in response to detection of excessive heater temperatures. Wiring <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> respectively extend from temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to the system control circuitry (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>) to facilitate control of system operation in response to conditions detected by the sensor and switch. Alternatively, a sensor element may be employed that performs the functions of each of the temperature sensor and cut-out switch. The cut-out switch may be disposed at any suitable locations on the arm or within the housing compartment along with, or independent of, the temperature sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The cut-out switch may alternatively be implemented by an additional temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>) to facilitate disablement of the heater in response to excessive heater temperatures. In particular, temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and may be disposed on arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in substantially the same manner described above for cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. Temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> measures the temperature of a container placed on the heating plate and provides a temperature signal to controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> via appropriate wiring. The controller disables power to the heater in response to the temperature signal indicating a temperature in excess of a predetermined threshold. Temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> may be disposed at any suitable location on the arm or within the housing compartment along with, or independent of, temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An exemplary system control circuit employing the cut-out switch to facilitate disablement of the heater in response to excessive heater temperatures is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. Specifically, a control circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes power conductors <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a ground <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, power switch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, a solid state relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, high temperature cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, limit switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Power conductors <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> each include a respective fuse <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (e.g., a conventional two amp fuse) that is arranged in series with power switch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to prevent power surges from damaging the switch and circuitry. Power switch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> controls power to the circuitry and is connected to the controller, relay and heater. The power switch may include a light <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> to illuminate the switch. Controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is further connected to solid state relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. The controller controls power applied to the heater via relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> in accordance with a comparison of a temperature measured by temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and a desired temperature entered into the controller by a user. In particular, controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> receives temperature signals from temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> indicating the temperature of a medical solution container in contact with the sensor (i.e., the container disposed on the heating plate surface). In response to the temperature measured by sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> being equal to or exceeding a desired temperature entered by a user, the controller disables power to the heater via solid state relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Conversely, when the temperature measured by temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is below the desired temperature, the controller enables power to the heater via the solid state relay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Limit switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is connected between power switch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and controls power to the heater in accordance with the presence of a medical solution container within the system as described above. Temperature cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is similarly connected between the power switch and heater to disable the heater in response to detecting a heater temperature in excess of a predetermined threshold as described above. Thus, the limit and cut-out switches <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> directly control power to the heater irrespective of relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. In other words, these switches override the controller and relay to disable power to the heater in response to detection of the absence of a medical solution container on the heating plate and excess heater temperatures, respectively. Control circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may alternatively be implemented by any conventional circuitry components performing the above-described functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An exemplary system control circuit employing an additional temperature sensor to facilitate disablement of the heater in response to excessive heater temperatures is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>.

The controller controls power applied to the heater via relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> in accordance with a comparison of a temperature measured by temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and a desired temperature entered into the controller by a user. In particular, controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> receives temperature signals from temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> indicating the temperature of a medical solution container in contact with the sensor (i.e., the container disposed on the heating plate surface). In response to the temperature measured by sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> being equal to or exceeding a desired temperature entered by a user, the controller disables power to the heater via solid state relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Conversely, when the temperature measured by temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is below the desired temperature, the controller enables power to the heater via the solid state relay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Limit switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is connected between controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and solid state relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and facilitates control of the heater in accordance with the presence of a medical solution container within the system. Basically, the limit switch enables the solid state relay to control power to the heater in accordance with control signals generated by the controller. When a medical solution container is present on the heating plate, the limit switch is in a closed state as described above. Accordingly, the connection between the controller and relay is enabled to facilitate control of the heater in accordance with control signals generated by the controller. Conversely, when a medical solution container is removed or absent from the heating plate, the limit switch is in an open state as described above. Thus, the connection between the controller and relay is disabled to prevent operation of the heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is connected to the controller to facilitate disablement of the heater in response to detecting a heater temperature in excess of a predetermined threshold as described above. Basically, temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> provides a temperature indication of the solution container to controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The controller disables power to the heater via relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> in response to the measured temperature exceeding a predetermined threshold as described above.

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Operation of the temperature controlled system is described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>B. Initially, a user selects a medical solution (e.g., a bag or bottle containing saline or IV solutions, antibiotics or other drugs, blood, etc.) for heating within the housing compartment and determines an appropriate temperature for the solution. The user subsequently activates power switch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and pivots door <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (e.g., via a handle disposed on the door) outward from the housing to an open state. The selected solution is placed on heating plate bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> within the housing compartment, and the door is subsequently pivoted toward the housing to a closed state. The desired temperature for the medical solution is entered into controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> via input devices or buttons <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. In response to placement of the medical solution container on the heating plate bottom wall, the container engages temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and causes limit switch arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to flex toward limit switch housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The flexing of the limit switch arm forces contact member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> into the limit switch housing to close switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and enable the heater as described above. The controller receives signals from temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and controls solid state relay <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> accordingly to enable or disable power to heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The heater applies heat to the heating plate bottom wall, while heating plate side walls <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> conduct heat from bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to evenly distribute heat to the medical solution container. Cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and/or temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> may be employed to facilitate disablement of the heater in response to excessive heater temperatures as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> displays the temperature of the container as measured by temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, and may alternatively display the desired or set point temperature entered by the user. When the medical solution has attained the desired temperature, the door is pivoted to an open state as described above and the heated medical solution container is removed from the housing compartment. The door is subsequently returned to a closed state. In response to removal of the container from the heating plate bottom wall, the limit switch arm is biased toward the heating plate, thereby opening the limit switch and disabling the heater as described above. Further, an additional medical solution container may replace the removed container within the housing compartment for heating by the system. The system preferably accommodates a single medical item, however, any quantity of medical items may be disposed within the compartment for heating by the system. </paragraph>

The heating assembly is substantially similar to the heating assembly described above and includes heating plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and limit switch <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The heating plate includes bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> extending at an angle from the bottom wall longer dimensioned side edges toward the interior surfaces of the heating compartment front and rear walls to form a generally &lsquo;U&rsquo;-shaped heating plate configuration as described above. Heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is disposed on the bottom surface of the heating plate bottom wall as described above. This arrangement facilitates rapid heating of a medical item as described above which is especially advantageous during employment of the system in time critical situations, such as in an operating room. For example, the system may heat items to a desired temperature in the approximate range of 80&deg; F. to 150&deg; F. within a short time interval, generally within one hour (e.g., the particular time interval depends on various factors, such as initial item temperature, room temperature, selected desired temperature, etc.). The limit switch includes arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> with temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, and housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> including support member <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, contact member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> and switch circuitry <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> as described above. The limit switch is disposed below the heating plate with the limit switch components arranged in the manner described above for system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The limit switch detects the presence of a medical solution container on the heating plate and enables and disables heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in substantially the same manner described above. Further, the limit switch arm may include cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and/or additional temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> to facilitate disablement of the heater in response to excessive heater temperatures as described above. System <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may include exemplary control circuitry <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> described above to control system operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> System <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> stores and heats a plurality of medical solution containers as illustrated, by way of example only, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Specifically, containers <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are initially placed into the system via top wall <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. The containers are typically positioned within the housing storage compartment in a stacked relation with each successive container placed within the storage compartment resting upon a previously loaded container. Typically, an initial container <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is disposed on the heating plate bottom wall and in contact with temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. Container <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is heated to a desired temperature entered by a user into controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). In response to attaining the desired temperature, container <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is removed from the heating plate via door <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. After removal of container <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the heating compartment, successive container <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is urged by gravitational forces, or may be manually manipulated, into position on the heating plate bottom wall for heating to the desired temperature. During switching of containers on the heating plate, the limit switch may momentarily disable the heater when the limit switch arm disengages with a container prior to engagement with another container. However, such momentary disablement does not significantly alter the desired temperature of the heating plate. Once the last container is removed from the system, the limit switch disables the heater until another container is placed on the heating plate as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The alternative system provides the feature of heating plural medical solution containers simultaneously within the housing compartment. In particular, during heating of a container on the heating plate, remaining containers within the storage compartment are subjected to secondary heating prior to being received by the heating plate. Secondary heating occurs within the storage compartment as a result of convective heat transfer from the heating plate walls. A container subjected to secondary heating requires a shorter residence time on the heating plate to achieve the desired temperature, thereby accelerating the heating process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Operation of system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Initially, operation of system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to the operation of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> described above except that additional containers may be stored within the storage compartment. Specifically, a user selects one or more medical solutions (e.g., bags or bottles containing saline or IV solutions, antibiotics or other drugs, blood, etc.) for heating by the system and determines an appropriate temperature for the solution. The user subsequently activates power switch <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and pivots top wall <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> to an open state. The selected solution containers are placed into the system in stacked relation with an initial container disposed on heating plate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Top wall <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> is subsequently pivoted to a closed state and the desired temperature for the selected solutions is entered into controller <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> via input devices or buttons <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> as described above. In response to placement of a container on the heating plate bottom wall, the container engages temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and causes limit switch arm <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to flex toward limit switch housing <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The flexing of the limit switch arm forces contact member <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> into the limit switch housing to actuate switch circuitry <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> and effectively close the switch, thereby enabling heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> as described above. The controller receives signals from temperature sensor <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and controls a solid state relay accordingly to enable or disable power to heater <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> as described above. The heater applies heat to the heating plate bottom wall, while heating plate side walls <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> conduct heat from bottom wall <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> to evenly distribute heat to the initial container. Cut-out switch <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and/or temperature sensor <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> may be employed to facilitate disablement of the heater in response to excessive heater temperatures as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In response to attaining the desired temperature, the initial container is removed from the heating plate via door <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, while a successive container is urged by gravitational forces and/or manually manipulated into position on the heating plate bottom wall. The above process may be repeated for subsequent containers stored in the system. Once the last container is removed, the limit switch disables the heater until another container is placed on the heating plate as described above. </paragraph>
