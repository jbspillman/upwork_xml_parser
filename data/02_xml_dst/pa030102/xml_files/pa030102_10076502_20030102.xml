<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus for evaluating a degree of arteriosclerosis of a living subject, based on pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information (e.g., a pulse-wave propagation time or a pulse-wave propagation velocity) that is related to a velocity at which a pulse wave propagates in the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art Statement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Arteriosclerosis is known as a factor that influences pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information. This is utilized to evaluate a degree of arteriosclerosis of a living subject based on pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information obtained from the subject. For example, an apparatus disclosed in Japanese patent document No. 9-122091 or its corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,743,856 includes an electrocardiograph for detecting an electrocardiographic waveform (electrocardiogram), a pressure sensor for detecting a brachial pulse wave occurring to an inflatable cuff, and calculates, as a pulse-wave propagation time, a time difference between a time of detection of an R-wave of the electrocardiogram and a time of detection of a peak of the brachial pulse wave. In addition, the disclosed apparatus calculates a pulse wave propagation velocity by dividing, by the thus calculated pulse wave propagation time, a distance between the heart of the subject and an upper arm on which the cuff is worn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Based on whether the thus obtained pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information is abnormal, it is judged whether a medical treatment, such as administration of drug, is needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, if the obtained pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information is a value in the vicinity of a boundary between a normal range and an abnormal range, a correct judgment may not be made to administer drug, based on the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Recently, it has been elucidated that there are cases where patients suffer arteriosclerosis though their pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information is normal and there are cases where subjects do not suffer arteriosclerosis though their pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information is abnormal. More specifically described, pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information changes with not only arteriosclerosis degree but also blood pressure. Therefore, in the case where subject&apos;s blood pressure is lowered by use of antihypertensive drug, the subject shows normal pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information, even if the subject may suffer arteriosclerosis. In addition, in the case where a subject suffers hypertension, the subject shows abnormal pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information, even though the subject may not suffer arteriosclerosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, an augmentation index, AI, is known as an index for evaluating a degree of arteriosclerosis. Generally, this index is calculated as a percentage of an augmentation between a magnitude of a peak of a pulse wave and a magnitude of a peak of an incident-wave component contained in the pulse wave, relative to a pulse pressure of the pulse wave. However, since a correlation of the augmentation index with respect to arteriosclerosis is lower than that of the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information, the reliability of a diagnosis made based on the augmentation index only is low. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus for evaluating a degree of arteriosclerosis of a living subject with high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above object has been achieved by the present invention. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for evaluating a degree of arteriosclerosis of a living subject, comprising a pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining device which obtains pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information that is related to a velocity at which a pulse wave propagates in the subject; a pulse-wave sensor which is adapted to be worn on a body portion of the subject and detects the pulse wave from the body portion; an augmentation-related-information obtaining means for obtaining augmentation-related information that is related to an augmentation of an amplitude of the pulse wave detected by the pulse-wave sensor from an amplitude of an incident-wave component which is contained in the pulse wave; and an arteriosclerosis evaluating means for evaluating the degree of arteriosclerosis of the subject, based on the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information obtained by the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining device and the augmentation-related information obtained by the augmentation-related-information obtaining means, according to a prescribed relationship between (A) (a1) pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and (a2) augmentation-elated information and (B) degree of arteriosclerosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, the arteriosclerosis evaluating means evaluates the degree of arteriosclerosis, based on two sorts of information, i.e., the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information obtained by the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining device and the augmentation-related information obtained by the augmentation-related-information obtaining means. Therefore, the present apparatus enjoys improved accuracy of the arteriosclerosis evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for evaluation of a degree of arteriosclerosis of a living subject, comprising a pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining device which obtains pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information that is related to a velocity at which a pulse wave propagates in the subject; a pulse-wave sensor which is adapted to be worn on a body portion of the subject and detects the pulse wave from the body portion; an augmentation-related-information obtaining means for obtaining augmentation-related information that is related to an augmentation of an amplitude of the pulse wave detected by the pulse-wave sensor from an amplitude of an incident-wave component which is contained in the pulse wave; and a simultaneously displaying device which simultaneously displays the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information obtained by the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining device and the augmentation-related information obtained by the augmentation-related-information obtaining means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to this invention, the simultaneously displaying device simultaneously displays the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and the augmentation-related information each of which reflects a degree of arteriosclerosis. Therefore, a medical person can make, based on the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and the augmentation-related information, a more accurate diagnosis about the degree of arteriosclerosis, than a diagnosis made based on the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information only. For example, in the case where the medical person cannot make a clear judgment about whether there is a need to treat a patient, e.g., administer drug, based on the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information only, the person can judge that the treatment is needed, if the augmentation-related information indicates that the patient suffers arteriosclerosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the augmentation-related-information obtaining device comprises augmentation-index determining means for determining, as the augmentation-related information, an augmentation index indicative of the augmentation of the amplitude of the pulse wave from the amplitude of the incident-wave component, and the simultaneously displaying device comprises a display device which displays, in a two-dimensional coordinate system defined by a first axis representative of pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and a second axis representative of augmentation index, a symbol at a position having a pair of coordinates corresponding to the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information obtained by the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining device and the augmentation index determined by the augmentation-index determining means. According to this feature, the medical person can easily make, based on the position of the symbol displayed in the two-dimensional coordinate system, a diagnosis about the degree of arteriosclerosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the display device displays the two-dimensional coordinate system which includes an arteriosclerosis area corresponding to an arteriosclerosis range of each of the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and the augmentation index represented by the first and second axes, and al least one of an arteriosclerosis-suspect area corresponding to a normal range of the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and the arteriosclerosis range of the augmentation index and a hypertension area corresponding to the arteriosclerosis range of the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and a normal range of the augmentation index. According to this feature, if the symbol is displayed in the arteriosclerosis area, the medical person can easily evaluate the degree of arteriosclerosis. If the symbol is displayed in the arteriosclerosis-suspect area, the person can speculate that the subject is highly suspected of arteriosclerosis and the subject&apos;s blood pressure is kept low by use of antihypertensive drug; and if the symbol is displayed in the hypertension area, the person can speculate that the subject is not suspected of arteriosclerosis but the subject suffers hypertension and that the subject would probably suffer arteriosclerosis in future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining device comprises an incident-wave-peak determining means for determining a peak of the incident-wave component contained in the pulse wave detected by the pulse-wave sensor; a reflected-wave-peak determining means for determining a peak of a reflected-wave component which is contained in the pulse wave detected by the pulse-wave sensor; and an obtaining means for obtaining the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information based on the peak of the incident-wave component determined by the incident-wave-peak determining means and the peak of the reflected-wave component determined by the reflected-wave-peak determining means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to this feature, the incident-wave-peak determining means determines the peak of the incident-wave component of the pulse wave detected by the pulse-wave sensor, the reflected-wave-peak determining means determines the peak of the reflected-wave component of the pulse wave, and the obtaining means obtains the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information based, e.g., a time difference between the peak of the incident-wave component and the peak of the reflected-wave component. In the case where the augmentation index is determined based on the pulse wave detected by the pulse-wave sensor, the present apparatus can obtain both the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and the augmentation index, by employing the single pulse-wave sensor.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, there will be described an embodiment of the present invention in detail by reference to the drawings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic view showing a circuitry of an arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to which the present invention is applied. The present apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is worn on a neck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of a living subject, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, with the help of a band <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a container-like sensor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>; a case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which accommodates the sensor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>; and a feed screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is threadedly engaged with the sensor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is rotated by an electric motor, not shown, provided in the case <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to move the sensor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a widthwise direction of a carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. With the help of the band <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is detachably attached to the neck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such that an open end of the sensor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is opposed to a body surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the neck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In addition, the pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is secured via a diaphragm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to an inner wall of the sensor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, such that the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is movable relative to the housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is advanceable out of the open end of the same <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The sensor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, etc. cooperate with one another to define a pressure chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is supplied with a pressurized air from an air pump <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> via a pressure-control valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, so that the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pressed against the body surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with a pressing force corresponding to the air pressure (Pa) in the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The sensor housing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the diaphragm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> cooperate with each other to provide a pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which presses the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> against the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and the feed screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the not-shown motor cooperate with each other to provide a widthwise-direction moving device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which moves the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the widthwise direction of the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and thereby changes a pressing position where the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pressed on the body surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a pressing surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and a number of semiconductor pressure-sensing elements (hereinafter, referred to as the &ldquo;pressure-sensing elements&rdquo;) E which are arranged in the pressing surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at a regular interval in the widthwise direction of the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, i.e., in the direction of movement of the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> parallel to the feed screw <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, over a length greater than the diameter of the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, fifteen semiconductor pressure-sensing elements E(a), E(b), . . . , E(o) are arranged at a regular interval of, e.g., 0.6 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, constructed as described above, is pressed against the body surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the neck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> right above the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, so that the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> detects a pressure pulse wave (i.e., a carotid pulse wave, wc) which is produced from the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is propagated to the body surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and supplies a pressure-pulse-wave signal SM representing the detected carotid pulse wave wc, to a control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> via an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining essential control functions of the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An optimum-pressing-position determining means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> judges whether a prescribed pressing-position changing condition is satisfied, i.e., whether one (hereinafter, referred to as the &ldquo;highest-pressure detecting element EM&rdquo;) of the pressure-sensing elements E of the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that detects the highest pressure of the respective pressures detected by all the elements E is positioned in one of prescribed opposite end portions of the array of pressure-sensing elements E. Each of the prescribed opposite end portions of the array of elements E may be a range having a prescribed length including a corresponding one of the opposite ends of the array of elements E, or a range accommodating a prescribed number of elements E including a corresponding one of the respective elements E located at the opposite ends of the array. The highest-pressure detecting element EM is one of the elements E that is positioned right above the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When this pressing-position changing condition is satisfied, the optimum-pressing-position determining means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> carries out the following pressing-position changing operation: After the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> once moves the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> away from the body surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the widthwise-direction moving device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> moves the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over a prescribed distance, and then the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> again presses the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a prescribed, considerably low first pressing force HDP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this state, the determining means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> judges again whether the prescribed pressing-position changing condition is satisfied. The determining means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> repeats carrying out the above-described operation and judgment till the pressing-position changing condition is not satisfied any longer, preferably till the highest-pressure detecting element EM is positioned in a prescribed middle portion of the array of elements E. The length, or element number, employed for each of the opposite end portions of the array of elements E is prescribed based on the diameter of the artery (i.e., the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) to be pressed by the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and may be one fourth of the diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A pressing-force changing means <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> changes, after the optimum-pressing-position determining means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> positions the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the optimum pressing position, a pressing force HDP (i.e., a hold-down pressure) applied by the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, within a prescribed pressing-force range, either stepwise in response to each heartbeat of the subject or continuously at a prescribed, considerably low rate. Based on the carotid pulse wave wc obtained during the changing of the pressing force HDP, the changing means <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> determines an optimum pressing force HDPO and maintains the pressing force applied by the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, at the thus determined optimum pressing force HDPO. Here, the optimum pressing force HDPO is so determined that a pulse pressure PPc of the carotid pulse wave wc (i.e., a value obtained by subtracting a minimal value, from a maximal value, of one heartbeat-synchronous pulse of the carotid pulse wave wc) detected by the highest-pressure detecting element EM pressed by the pressing force HDP may not be smaller than a predetermined lower-limit pulse pressure PPc<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>. The lower-limit pulse pressure PPc<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>is experimentally determined as a value which assures that a reference point used to obtain pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information can be accurately identified on the carotid pulse wave wc. If the pulse pressure PPc is too small, a clear carotid pulse wave wc is not obtained and accordingly accuracy of determination of the reference point on the carotid pulse wave wc is lowered. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The waveform-pattern numbers may pattern numbers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, that correspond to four different waveforms, respectively. Pattern number <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponds to the lowest arteriosclerosis degree, and pattern number <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> corresponds to the highest arteriosclerosis degree. As the pattern numbers increase, the arteriosclerosis degrees increase. Pattern number <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponds to a waveform in which the first maximal point occurring after a rising point of a heartbeat-synchronous pulse coincides with the greatest point of the pulse; pattern number <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponds to a waveform in which a difference between a magnitude of the first maximal point or inflection point after a rising point of a pulse and a magnitude of the greatest point of the pulse is smaller than a first reference value; pattern number <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> corresponds to a waveform in which a difference between a magnitude of the first maximal point or inflection point after a rising point of a pulse and a magnitude of the greatest point of the pulse is not smaller than the first reference value and smaller than a second reference value greater than the first reference value; and pattern number <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> corresponds to a waveform in which a difference between a magnitude of the first maximal point or inflection point after a rising point of a pulse and a magnitude of the greatest point of the pulse is not smaller than the second reference value. Each waveform pattern can be classified into one of the pattern numbers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, because, as the degree of arteriosclerosis increases, the magnitude of the reflected-wave component increases and accordingly the magnitude of the greatest point of the composite pulse wave increases relative to the magnitude of the incident-wave component (i.e., the magnitude of the first maximal or inflection point of the incident-wave component after the rising point thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An arteriosclerosis evaluating means <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> evaluates a degree of arteriosclerosis of a patient, based on the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information obtained by the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and the augmentation-related information obtained by the augmentation-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, according to a prescribed relationship between (A) (a1) pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and (a2) augmentation-related information, and (B) degree of arteriosclerosis. The prescribed relationship is stored, in advance, in the ROM <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Here, it is assumed that the ROM <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> stores a prescribed relationship between pulse wave propagation velocity PWV as (a1) pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related information and augmentation index AI, calculated according to Expression 2, as (a2) augmentation-related information, and (B) degree of arteriosclerosis. Each of pulse wave propagation velocity PWV and augmentation index AI changes with arteriosclerosis degree. More specifically described, as arteriosclerosis degree increases, pulse wave propagation velocity PWV increases, and augmentation index AI increases. Therefore, for each of pulse wave propagation velocity PWV and augmentation index AI, a normal range and an arteriosclerosis-suspect range are experimentally determined in advance. The relationship pre-stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is so prescribed that the arteriosclerosis evaluating means <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> judges that the patient suffers arteriosclerosis, if each of the pulse wave propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI obtained from the patient falls in the arteriosclerosis-suspect range, and judges that the patient is normal, if each of the pulse wave propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI falls in the normal range. In addition, the above relationship is so prescribed that the arteriosclerosis evaluating means <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> judges that the patient suffers hypertension, if the pulse wave propagation velocity PWV falls in the arteriosclerosis-suspect range but the augmentation index AI falls in the normal range. In this case, it can be speculated that the patient shows the pulse wave propagation velocity PWV that does not fall in the normal range, because the patient suffers hypertension, and that the patient does not suffer arteriosclerosis. On the other hand, if the pulse wave propagation velocity PWV falls in the normal range but the augmentation index AI falls in the arteriosclerosis-suspect range, it can be speculated that the patient is suspected of arteriosclerosis and that the patent may show the pulse wave propagation velocity PWV falling in the normal range, because of use of antihypertensive drug. In this case, the arteriosclerosis evaluating means <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> judges, according to the above relationship, that the patient is suspected of arteriosclerosis and needs medical observation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> carries out Steps SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to SA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (hereinafter, the term &ldquo;Step(s)&rdquo; is omitted, if appropriate) corresponding to the optimum-pressing-position determining means <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. First, at SA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the control device operates the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to change the pressure in the pressure chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that the pressing force HDP applied to the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is held at the prescribed first pressing force HDP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The first pressing force HDP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is experimentally determined, in advance, as a pressing force HDP which assures that an S/N ratio of the carotid pulse wave wc detected by each pressure-sensing element E is high enough to allow the peak pc of the carotid pulse wave wc to be detected with considerably high accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Then, the control proceeds with SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> where the control device judges whether the prescribed pressing-position changing condition (i.e., the APS-starting condition) is satisfied, i.e., whether the highest-pressure-detecting element EM as one of the pressure-sensing elements E provided in the pressing surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is located in one of the prescribed opposite end portions of the array of elements E. If a negative judgment is made at SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the control goes to SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the following steps, described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if a positive judgment is made at SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, that is, if the pressing position where the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pressed against the carotid artery <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not appropriate, the control proceeds with SA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, i.e., an APS-controlling routine. According to this APS-controlling routine, the control device determines the optimum pressing position where the highest-pressure-detecting element EM is located at substantially the middle of the array of elements E. To this end, the control device operates the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the widthwise-direction moving device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to once move the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> off the body surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, move the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> over a prescribed distance, and again press the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the prescribed pressing force HDP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this state, the control device again judges whether the highest-pressure-detecting element EM is located at substantially the middle of the array of elements E. SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and SA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are repeated till a positive judgment is made at SA<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Thus, at SA<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the control device positions the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the optimum pressing position. Then, the control goes to SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where the control device selects, in this state, a new highest-pressure detecting element EM from the pressure-sensing elements E of the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is followed by SA<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> corresponding to the pressing-force changing means <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, where the control device carries out the HDP-controlling routine in which the pressing force HDP applied by the pressing device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is continuously increased from the first pressing force HDP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. During this increasing of the pressing force HDP, the control device determines an optimum pressing force HDPO based on a judgment about whether a pulse pressure PPc of each of successive heartbeat-synchronous pulses of the carotid pulse wave wc detected by the highest-pressure detecting element EM selected at SA<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is not smaller than the prescribed lower-limit pulse pressure PPc<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>. Then, the control device maintains the pressing force HDP applied to the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, at the thus determined optimum pressing force HDPO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Then, the control goes to SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> where the control device reads in the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM supplied from the highest-pressure detecting element EM of the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and, then at SA<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the control device judges whether the control device has read in one heartbeat-synchronous pulse of the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM, e.g., by judging whether the control device has read in a rising point of a heartbeat-synchronous pulse of the carotid pulse wave that follows a rising point of its preceding heartbeat-synchronous pulse. If a negative judgment is made at SA<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the following steps are repeated to continue reading in the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM. Meanwhile, if a positive judgment is made at SA<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, then the control device carries out the signal processing routine shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Next, the signal processing routine of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> will be explained. First, at SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to the reflected-wave-peak detecting means <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the control device determines a peak pc of the one pulse of the carotid pulse wave wc represented by the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM read in at SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, stores a magnitude of the peak pc in the RAM <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and determines a time of occurrence of the peak pc as a time of occurrence of a peak pr of the reflected-wave component wr of the carotid pulse wave wc. The thus determined time of occurrence of the peak pr is also stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Then, the control goes to SB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponding to the incident-wave-peak determining means <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. At SB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the control device subjects, to a fourth-order differentiation treatment or analysis, a portion or length of the pressure-pulse-wave signal SM, read in at SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, that continues from a time corresponding to the rising point of the carotid pulse wave wc and to the time corresponding to the peak pc determined at SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and thereby determines an inflection point or a maximal point occurring to the length of the signal SM. A time of occurrence of the inflection or maximal point is determined as a time of occurrence of a peak pi of the incident-wave component wi, and is stored in the RAM <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In addition, a magnitude of the inflection or maximal point is stored, in the RAM <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, as a magnitude of the peak pi of the incident-wave component wi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the control goes to SB<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and SB<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> corresponding to the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. At SB<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the control device determines a pulse-wave propagation time DT by subtracting the time of occurrence of the peak pi of the incident-wave wi, determined at SB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, from the time of occurrence of the peak pr of the reflected-wave wr, determined at SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, at SB<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the control device determines, according to the above-indicated Expression 1, a pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV based on the pulse-wave propagation time DT determined at SB<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Then, the control goes to SB<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> corresponding to the augmentation-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. At SB<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the control device calculates a peak difference &Dgr;P by subtracting the magnitude of the peak pi of the incident-wave component wi, determined at SB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, from the magnitude of the peak pc of the carotid pulse wave wc, determined at SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition, the control device calculates a pulse pressure PPc by subtracting the minimal value, from the maximal value, of the one pulse of the carotid pulse wave wc read in at SA<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and calculates an augmentation index AI (%) by substituting the thus obtained peak difference &Dgr;P and pulse pressure PPc for the corresponding variables of the above-indicated Expression 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the control goes to SB<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> corresponding to the arteriosclerosis evaluating means <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. At SB<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the control device evaluates a degree of arteriosclerosis of the subject, based on the pulse wave propagation velocity PWV determined at SB<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the augmentation index AI determined at SB<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, according to an arteriosclerosis-evaluate map <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, that is pre-stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In addition, the control device operates the display device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to display a result of the evaluation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Here, the arteriosclerosis-evaluate map <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is described in detail. The arteriosclerosis-evaluate map <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> defines, for the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV, a normal range not higher than 900 cm/s and an abnormal range (i.e., an arteriosclerosis-suspect range) higher than 900 cm/s, and defines, for the augmentation index AI, a normal range not higher than 10% and an abnormal range (i.e., an arteriosclerosis-suspect range) higher than 10%. The map <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> includes a first arteriosclerosis area <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the above-indicated abnormal range of the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV and a not lower than 20% portion of the above-indicated abnormal range of the augmentation index AI and which indicates that a subject suffers a high degree of arteriosclerosis; a second arteriosclerosis area <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the abnormal range of the propagation velocity PWV and a 10 to 20% portion of the abnormal range of the augmentation index AI and which indicates that a subject suffers a medium degree of arteriosclerosis; a third arteriosclerosis area <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the abnormal range of the propagation velocity PWV and a 0 to 10% portion of the above-indicated normal range of the augmentation index AI and which indicates that a subject suffers arteriosclerosis but its degree is low; a hypertension area <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the abnormal range of the propagation velocity PWV and a not higher than 0% portion of the normal range of the augmentation index AI and which indicates that a subject suffers hypertension; a normal range <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the normal range of each of the propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI; and a first arteriosclerosis-suspect area <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the normal range of the propagation velocity PWV and the 10 to 20% portion of the abnormal range of the augmentation index AI and which indicates that a subject cannot be diagnosed as an arteriosclerosis case but is suspected of it; and a second arteriosclerosis-suspect area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the normal range of the propagation velocity PWV and the not lower than 20% portion of the abnormal range of the augmentation index AI and which indicates that a subject cannot be diagnosed as an arteriosclerosis case but is more highly suspected of it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Then, the control goes to SB<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> corresponding to the simultaneously displaying means <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. At SB<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the control device operates the display device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to display, in a two-dimensional coordinate system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> defined by a first axis representative of pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV and a second axis representative of augmentation index AI, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at a position having a pair of coordinates corresponding to the augmentation index AI determined at SB<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV determined at SB<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the display device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> displays, in the two-dimensional coordinate system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, respective indications corresponding to the various areas <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. More specifically described, the display device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> displays the indication &ldquo;ARTERIOSCLEROSIS AREA (HIGH DEGREE)&rdquo; for the first arteriosclerosis area <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the indication &ldquo;ARTERIOSCLEROSIS AREA (MEDIUM DEGREE)&rdquo; for the second arteriosclerosis area <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the indication &ldquo;ARTERIOSCLEROSIS AREA (LOW DEGREE)&rdquo; for the third arteriosclerosis area <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the indication &ldquo;ARTERIOSCLEROSIS-SUSPECT AREA (DEGREE <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)&rdquo; for the first arteriosclerosis-suspect area <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and the indication &ldquo;ARTERIOSCLEROSIS-SUSPECT AREA (DEGREE <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)&rdquo; for the second arteriosclerosis-suspect area <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows, as examples of the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a circular symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a triangular symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and a rectangular symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>Hereinafter, there will be described how to evaluate a degree of arteriosclerosis when each of those symbols <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is displayed. When the circular symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is displayed, a medical person such as a doctor or a nurse can judge with high reliability that the patient suffers arteriosclerosis, because both the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI are abnormally high. When the triangular symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or the rectangular symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is displayed, the medical person may not be able to judge whether a treatment such as drug administration is needed, in the conventional manner in which only the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV is used, because the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>indicates that the propagation velocity PWV is near the upper-limit value of the normal range of propagation velocity PWV. However, since the triangular symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>indicates that the augmentation index AI is abnormally high, the medical person can judge that a treatment such as drug administration is needed. On the other hand, since the rectangular symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>indicates that the augmentation index AI is normal, the medical person can judge that no treatment is needed at present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the foregoing description of the illustrated embodiment employing the flow charts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> evaluates, at SB<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (the arteriosclerosis evaluating means <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>), the degree of arteriosclerosis of the patient based on two sorts of information, i.e., the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV determined at SB<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>) and the augmentation index AI determined at SB<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (the augmentation-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>). Therefore, the present apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can evaluate the degree of arteriosclerosis with improved accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment employing the flow charts, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> operates, at SB<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (the simultaneously displaying means <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>), the display device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to display, in the two-dimensional coordinate system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> at the position having the coordinates corresponding to the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV determined at SB<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>) and the augmentation index AI determined at SB<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (the augmentation-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>). Therefore, the medical person can easily make, based on the position of the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> plotted in the two-dimensional coordinate system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a diagnosis about the degree of arteriosclerosis. Since the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI are used, the accuracy of the diagnosis is improved as compared with the conventional manner in which only the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV is used. For example, in the case where the medical person cannot easily judge, based on the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV only, whether a treatment such as drug administration is needed, the person can surely judge that the treatment is needed, if the augmentation index AI indicates arteriosclerosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the illustrated embodiment employing the flow charts, the display device <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> displays the two-dimensional coordinate system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> including the respective indications of the arteriosclerosis areas, the arteriosclerosis-suspect areas, and the hypertension area. Therefore, if the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is displayed in one of the arteriosclerosis areas, the medical person can judge that the patient suffers arteriosclerosis. In addition, if the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is displayed in one of the arteriosclerosis-suspect areas, the medical person can judge that the patient suffers arteriosclerosis and can speculate that the patient&apos;s blood pressure is lowered by use of antihypertensive drug. If the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is displayed in the hypertension area, the medical person can judge that the patient does not suffer arteriosclerosis but suffers hypertension and can speculate that the patient will suffer arteriosclerosis in future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the illustrated embodiment employing the flow charts, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines, at SB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (the incident-wave-peak determining means <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>) and SB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (the reflected-wave-peak determining means <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>), the peak pi of the incident-wave component wi, and the peak pr of the reflected-wave component wr, of the carotid pulse wave wc detected by the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In addition, the control device determines, at SB<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and SB<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (the pulse-wave-propagation-velocity-related-information obtaining means <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>), the pulse-wave propagation velocity PAW based on the time difference between the peak pi of the incident-wave component wi and the peak pr of the reflected-wave component wr. In addition, the control device <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> determines the augmentation index AI based on the carotid pulse wave wc detected by the pressure-pulse-wave sensor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the present apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can measure the pulse-wave-propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI, by using the single, pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in its preferred embodiment by reference to the drawings, it is to be understood that the invention may otherwise be embodied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For example, the illustrated arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> employs both the arteriosclerosis evaluating means <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and the simultaneously displaying means <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. However, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be modified to employ only one of the two means <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> According to the flow charts shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> detects one heartbeat-synchronous pulse of the carotid pulse wave wc and, based on the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI obtained from the one pulse, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> evaluates the degree of arteriosclerosis and plots the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. However, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be modified to detect, for a prescribed time duration (e.g., 30 seconds), a plurality of heartbeat-synchronous pulse of the carotid pulse wave wc and determine respective averages of respective pulse-wave propagation velocity values PWV and respective augmentation index values AI obtained from those pulses. In the latter case, based on the thus determined averages, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> evaluates the degree of arteriosclerosis and plots the symbol <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determines the pulse-wave-propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI, based on the pulse wave detected by the single, pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, the apparatus may be modified to employ two separate sensors for detecting the pulse-wave-propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the pressure-pulse-wave detecting probe <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is worn on the neck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the living subject to detect the carotid pulse wave wc, and the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV and the augmentation index AI are determined based on the detected, single carotid pulse wave wc. However, the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV and/or the augmentation index AI may be determined based on a different pulse wave than the carotid pulse wave wc; such as a brachial pulse wave detected from an upper arm of a living subject, a radial pulse wave detected from a wrist of a subject, or a femoral pulse wave detected from a femur of a subject. Alternatively, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be modified to employ two heartbeat-synchronous-signal detecting devices which are adapted to be worn on two different body portions of a living subject, and determine a pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV based on two heartbeat-synchronous signals detected by the two heartbeat-synchronous-signal detecting devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the arteriosclerosis evaluating apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the arteriosclerosis-evaluate map <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> defines the higher than 900 cm/s range of the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV as the abnormal range thereof, and defines the higher than 10% range of the augmentation index AI as the abnormal range thereof. The abnormal ranges are not limited to those specific ranges. For example, those abnormal ranges may be changed depending upon individual differences of patients. In addition, the arteriosclerosis areas displayed in the two-dimensional coordinate system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are not limited to the specific areas employed in the illustrated embodiment, and may be changed, as needed, depending upon individual differences of patients. In the case where pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV is measured at a different portion of a living subject, the arteriosclerosis-evaluate map <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is modified to define a different abnormal range of the pulse-wave propagation velocity PWV. For example, when propagation velocity PWV is measured at a body portion between an upper arm and an ankle of a living subject, the map <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be modified to define, e.g., a higher than 1,400 cm/s range of the propagation velocity PWV as an abnormal range thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be embodied with other changes without departing from the spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
