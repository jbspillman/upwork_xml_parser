<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Even in areas where signals from only two or less base stations are available for position calculation, the mobile handset position can be calculated, expanding the position information service area and improving the usefulness. When the number of base stations available for position calculation is three or more, the position calculation is performed based on trilateration. When the number of available base stations is two or one, the position calculation is performed by using a two-station-based position calculation method or a one-station-based position calculation method according to the number of available base stations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to equipment for locating a current position of a mobile handset by using a radio signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> JP-A-7-181242 discloses a method for calculating a present position of a mobile handset by using a signal of a cellular telephone. The method of locating the current position of a mobile handset as disclosed in this official gazette will be described below. The mobile handset receives signals transmitted from three cellular telephone base stations. Based on the received signals, the mobile handset calculates differences in propagation time among the signals from the three base stations. The mobile handset, using the propagation time differences, calculates the current position according to triangulation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In areas very close to cellular phone base stations or in suburbs or mountainous regions where cellular phone base stations are few, the number of cellular phone base stations that satisfy a reception quality allowing a position measuring operation at the position of the mobile handset decreases. As a result, the number of base stations that satisfy the reception quality usable for position calculation becomes fewer than three, making it impossible to use signals from at least three base stations required for position calculation. This renders the locating of the current position of the mobile handset impossible with a conventional method using trilateration. Therefore, in areas where signals from only two or less base stations are available for position calculation, services using the position information cannot be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To solve the problem described above, one aspect of the present invention provides an equipment for calculating the mobile handset position which calculates the number of base stations available for position calculation, performs the position calculation based on trilateration when the number of base stations is three or more, performs the position calculation by using a two-station-based position calculation method when the number of base stations is two, and performs the position calculation by using a one-station-based position calculation method when the number of base stations is one. According to another aspect of the present invention, the equipment controls information to be provided to the mobile handset holder according to the number of base stations available for position calculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A more detailed description of the position calculation method will be given later. These processing and calculations may be executed by a processor based on software or by dedicated hardware. The scope of the present invention includes procedures themselves detailed later with reference to the accompanying drawings, and hardware and software for the procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A configuration of the equipment implementing the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A signal receiver <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> performs reception processing at a high/intermediate frequency corresponding to a cellular signal received by an antenna <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and also demodulation processing on a base band signal to generate a cellular reception signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A position calculation information generator <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> generates, from the cellular reception signal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, position calculation information <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> necessary for position calculation and outputs it to a base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The information required for position calculation includes, for example, a reception timing of the cellular signal from base stations and a reception quality of the cellular signal from base stations. The reception timing may be determined, for example, by using a matched filter and producing a delay profile of the received signal. The reception quality of the cellular signal may be determined from a correlation value of the delay profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the position calculation information <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> received, the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> selects base stations available for the position calculation and outputs position calculation information <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the selected base stations to a base station number counter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. For example, the method of selecting the base stations may select only those base stations whose signal-to-noise ratios of the received signals are in excess of a predetermined threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The base station number counter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> counts the number of base stations selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and outputs the selected number of base stations <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to a position calculation method controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The position calculation method controller <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> outputs to the position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and a position information application unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> a control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> that controls, according to the selected number of base stations <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the position calculation method to be performed by the position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, when the selected number of base stations <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is one, the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is set to 1; when the base station number is two, the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is set to 2; and when the number is three or more, the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is set to 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> selects the position calculation method according to the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, calculates the current position of a mobile handset by using the position calculation information <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the base stations selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and outputs a position calculation result <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The operation flow of the position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> will be explained by referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> checks if the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;3&rdquo; or not (step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). If the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> performs the position calculation based on trilateration (step <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>). When the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is not &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> checks whether the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;2&rdquo; (step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>). If the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;2&rdquo;, the position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> performs the position calculation according to a 2-station-based position calculation method (step <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>). When the step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> finds that the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is not &ldquo;2&rdquo;, i.e., the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> performs the position calculation according to a 1-station-based position calculation method (step <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>). The position calculation unit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> outputs a position calculation result <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> as the position calculation result <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> produced by the position calculation method selected according to the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a first example configuration of the 2-station-based position calculation step-<highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. In this example, of the position calculation information <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the base stations selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, first and second base station positions (X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) and (X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are used for position calculation. A base station positions averaging unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> calculates X and Y component averages of (X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) and (X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and outputs them as a mobile handset position (X, Y). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a second example configuration of the 2-station-based position calculation step <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. In this example, of the position calculation information <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the base stations selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, first and second base station positions (X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) and (X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and reception qualities of signals received from the first and second base stations, W<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, W<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, are used for position calculation. In this embodiment, a signal-to-noise ratio SNR is used as the reception quality of the received signal. As another reception quality a reception power of the received signal may be used. The base station positions averaging unit <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> calculates weighted averages from the X and Y components of (X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) and (X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) with the reception qualities W<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>taken as weights and outputs a mobile handset position (X, Y). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a third example configuration of the 2-station-based position calculation step <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. The position calculation information <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the base stations selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is input to a trilateration operation unit <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and a base station information storage <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. The base station information storage <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> holds position calculation information used in the past position calculations. In this example, the base stations selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are two stations, a first base station and a second base station, which is one station short of the requirement for trilateration. Hence, the base station information storage <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> selects position calculation information <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> on a third base station, different from the first and second base stations, from among the position calculation information used in the past position calculations, and outputs the selected information to the trilateration operation unit <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. The method for selecting the third base station, for example, needs only to select a base station different from the first and second base stations from among the base stations used in the latest position calculation. When there are two or more such base stations, one with the best reception quality may be chosen. The trilateration operation unit uses the position calculation information on the first and second base stations entered from the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the position calculation information on the third base station entered from the base station information storage <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> to perform the position calculation based on the principle of trilateration and then outputs a mobile handset position <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a first example configuration of the 1-station-based position calculation step <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>. In this example, of the position calculation information <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the first base station selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the first base station position (X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) is used for the position calculation. A base station position output unit <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> outputs the position (X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) as the mobile handset position (X, Y) <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a second example configuration of the 1-station-based position calculation step <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>. The position calculation information <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> on the base station selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is entered into a trilateration operation unit <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and a base station information storage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. The base station information storage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> holds position calculation information used in the past position calculations. In this embodiment, the base station selected by the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is only one station, a first base station, which is two stations short of the requirement for trilateration. Hence, the base station information storage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> selects position calculation information <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> on the second and third base stations, different from the first base station, from among the position calculation information used in the past position calculations and then outputs the selected information to the trilateration operation unit <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. The method for selecting the second and third base stations, for example, needs only to select two base stations different from the first base station from among the base stations used in the latest position calculation. When there are two or more such base stations, two with the best reception qualities may be chosen. The trilateration operation unit uses the position calculation information on the first base station entered from the base station selection unit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the position calculation information on the second and third base stations entered from the base station information storage <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to perform the position calculation based on the principle of trilateration and then outputs a mobile handset position <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The position information application unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> uses the received position calculation result <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to provide a mobile handset holder with services using position information, such as offering nearby store information and route guidance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an operation of the position information application unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> when it provides the nearby store information as the service using position information. It is assumed that the position calculation result <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> represents a position <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> as a current position. First, a case where the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;3&rdquo; will be explained. In this case, the number of base stations used in the position calculation is three or more and the accuracy of the position calculation result <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is considered good. The position information application unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> provides the mobile handset holder with information on stores <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> in an area <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> as the nearby store information. Next, a case in which the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;2&rdquo; will be explained. In this case, the number of base stations used in the position calculation is two and the accuracy of the position calculation result <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is considered worse than that when the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;3&rdquo;. In this case, the position information application unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> provides the mobile handset holder with information on stores <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> in an area <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> wider than the area <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> as the nearby store information. Finally, a case where the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;1&rdquo; will be explained. In this case the number of base stations used in the position calculation is one and the accuracy of the position calculation result <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is considered still worse than when the control signal <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;2&rdquo;. The position information application unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> provides the mobile handset holder with information on stores <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> in an area <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> wider than the area <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> as the nearby store information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As described above, even when the position locating accuracy is poor, the position information application unit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can provide the mobile handset holder with the nearby store information by controlling the area for the store information being provided according to the position locating accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With this invention, even in areas where signals from only two or less base stations are available for the position calculation, the current position of the mobile handset can be determined. This makes it possible to expand the area of the position information service. Further, by controlling the information to be provided to the user according to the number of base stations used in the position calculation, it is possible to offer useful information to the user even when only one base station is available for the position calculation and the position locating accuracy is bad. The usefulness of the position information service can therefore be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention and that various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
