<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An ergonomic chair includes a four-bar linkage arrangement wherein a lower frame member is provided with a rigid front support and a rigid rear support with a seat member pivotably connected to the front support. A back rest has an upper support pivotably connected at an upper end of the rear support of the lower frame member. A link member pivotably connects at a first end to a rear support of the seat member and at second end to a lower support of the back rest. This novel arrangement permits tilting movement of the backrest rearwardly relative to the lower frame member causing elevation of a rear portion of the seat member, permitting the feet to remain on the floor and alleviating pressure on the user&apos;s thighs, while rotation occurs closely coincident with the pivot axis of the user&apos;s hips and while maintaining a generally uniform gaze line. </paragraph>

</cross-reference-to-related-applications>
<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a chair of the type suitable for use in an office environment and, more particularly, to a reclining office chair having several structural and operating features which offer a number of ergonomic and other advantages over the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Over many years attempts have been made to design chairs for use in office environments which are comfortable to use and thereby avoid user fatigue over prolonged use. In one simple form a chair may be provided with a swivel base for ease of turning and include a control mechanism which permits the chair to rock. A disadvantage of these relatively simple chairs is that conjoint rocking motion of the chair seat and back naturally lifts the user&apos;s feet off the floor, which can create stability problems and place upward force on the front of the user&apos;s thighs which can reduce fluid circulation in the user&apos;s legs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To improve on the foregoing chair construction, chair controls are known which provide for synchronous movement of the chair seat and back. Where office chairs are concerned, a &ldquo;synchronous control&rdquo; means the arrangement of a combined or dependent back adjustment and seat adjustment, that is to say the adjustment of the back inclination fundamentally also results in an adjustment of the sitting surface. An example of a synchronous chair control is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,318,345, issued to Olson and assigned to the common assignee herein. With the aforementioned Olson control, the chair back is designed to tilt at one predetermined rate of recline while the seat tilts synchronously at a much lesser rate. The result is that the user&apos;s feet are not lifted from the floor when the back is reclined. Also, fluid circulation in the user&apos;s legs is not interrupted by substantial upward movement of the forward end of the seat. Another advantage of this control is that undesirable &ldquo;shirt pull&rdquo; is minimized by the strategic location of the tilt axis. Other examples of synchronous chair controls are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,366,274 and 5,860,701, to name a few. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 6,125,521, it is disclosed to be desirable to provide a chair having a seat and backrest which pivot generally about the axis of the hip joints of the user. A disadvantage of that chair is that as the chair back reclines, the rear of the seat also tilts downwardly, having the effect of changing the user&apos;s gaze angle. Further, in that chair, the arms also tilt with the chair back, thus displacing the user&apos;s arms away from any work surface. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,979,984, the seat is arranged to both slide forwardly and the rear portion of the seat moves downwardly as the back reclines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another feature embodied in recently designed office chairs that offers considerable ergonomic advantages is a tilt limiter feature for the chair back. With such a mechanism built into the chair control, the user may selectively set the degree of back recline at a predetermined angle thereby adding to comfort as the chair is used. An example of such a tilt limiter mechanism is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,477 issued to Kurtz and assigned to the common assignee herein. This particular mechanism offers the advantage of providing for infinitely variable angles of tilt within a predetermined overall range. The mechanism is also highly cost-effective to construct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature of current ergonomically designed chairs is the provision of height and pivot adjustable arm pads. Such a feature is particularly advantageous in providing the user with additional support to the arms, forearms, wrists and shoulders in order to minimize repetitive stress injuries when the user is keyboarding, for example, while seated in the chair. An example of such an adjustable arm pad using a gas cylinder is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,221 issued to Neil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature of current ergonomically designed office chairs includes an adjustable lumbar support mechanism for providing preselected chair back tension in the region of the user&apos;s lower back. An adjustable lumbar support allows the chair user to select a comfortable level of pressure on the lower back depending upon the specific office task being performed. Such a mechanism is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,652. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still another feature of certain ergonomically designed office chairs, particularly of recent vintage, is the incorporation of fabric mesh into the construction of the chair seat, and/or back. These materials ostensibly offer the advantage of enhanced air circulation for and consequent heat transfer from the chair user&apos;s body, which can improve the comfort of the chair. An example of the use of such fabric mesh in an office chair is disclosed in aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,125,521 issued to Stumpf et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Yet another feature of certain ergonomically designed chairs is the provision of a seat cushion having the capability of effecting heat transfer from the chair user&apos;s buttocks area while at the same time offering comfort to the user while seated, together with adequate support. Known seat cushions having such capability may involve a passive or active air flow circulation feature of the type disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,179,706. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Chair of Modular Construction U.S. Ser. No. 09/881,897, filed Jun. 15, 2001 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In each of these cases, features combine to provide an overall chair that is a significant improvement over the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus, for example, the present invention provides a reclining chair having a four bar linkage system that causes the rear of the seat to elevate as the back is reclined lending an unusual and comfortable balance during reclining. A very simple and economically constructed tilt limit control conveniently and effectively limits the degree of chair back tilt to one of several reclined positions by manual movement of a lever. Horizontal positioning of the chair seat cushion may be accomplished using a simple but positive locking device that allows the chair user to select a preferred horizontal seat cushion position. Height and pivot adjustable chair arms are simply and positively actuated with the push of a button or simple rotation, lending convenient adjustment to suit a specific work task. A lumbar support is easily height adjustable, by providing tension to the back frame and requires no screws or adjustment knobs in its adjustment mechanism, and also does so by avoiding direct contact of the lumbar support with the back of the user. A modular cushion seat includes a comfortable thermal air flow layer and gel layer which is vented uniquely for air circulation and stress and pressure management. The back of the chair is of fabric mesh construction and includes a novel attachment system for superior comfort. The base and back of the chair are of modular construction that provides for ease of assembly and lends rigidity to the chair construction, and in which an open skeletal frame structure displays both the simplicity of the chair structure while adding to its esthetic appeal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A primary object of the present invention is a tiltable chair wherein users of substantially all weights and sizes may be continuously balanced in the chair at any selected reclination position, therefore enhancing both &ldquo;fit&rdquo; and &ldquo;comfort.&rdquo; The present invention improves over the prior art by providing an ergonomic chair having a four-bar linkage arrangement wherein a lower frame member is provided with a rigid front support and a rigid rear support with a seat member pivotably connected to the front support. A back rest has a first pivot point connected at an upper end of the rear support of the lower frame member. A link member pivotably connects at a first end to a rear support of the seat member and at a second end to a second, lower pivot point on the back rest. This novel arrangement permits tilting movement of the backrest rearwardly relative to the lower frame member while concurrently causing elevation of a rear portion of the seat member, permitting the feet to remain on the floor and alleviating pressure on the user&apos;s thighs. This is accomplished by a linkage mechanism creating an instantaneous center of rotation of the chair seat and back that is approximately at the user&apos;s hip, so that the movement of the seat and back reduces undesirable &ldquo;shirt pull.&rdquo; This arrangement also is more responsive to the user and provides correct back support throughout tilt. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, and initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an improved ergonomic chair constructed in accordance with the numerous principles of the invention is shown and designated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises as its principal components a back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Suitable armrest assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having upper armrest pads <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> may be provided. The chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in a conventional manner, may be supported on a spider base <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> movable on casters <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is so constructed as to have synchronous movement of the back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The modular chair construction generally is described in greater detail in aforesaid copending application Ser. No. 09/881,897, incorporated herein by reference. The chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives the upper end of a gas cylinder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The gas cylinder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is preferably a two-stage type available from Stabilus GmbH of Germany. This cylinder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is operable by a manually pivotable lever arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which activates the cylinder <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for height and adjustability of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a manner well-known in the art, the advantage in this case is that movement of the arm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in either up or down direction effects movement of the cylinder to either direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> For purposes of clarity of discussion only, the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be described and claimed with reference to up, down, left and right and forward and rear as though a user were seated on the chair, but without intent to limit the claims except where apparent. Further, because many of the parts are identical but are mirror images in arrangement, the same part number will be used to describe like parts but with an &ldquo;L&rdquo; or &ldquo;R&rdquo; designation for the left or right side used only as and when necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed of modular construction. It has a central base or support module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a mounting section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> extending transversely. The mounting section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> forms a support which receives elongated seat and back frame support members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Armrest modules or assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are attached at the ends of the central base member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by bolts and hidden nuts (not shown). The lower curved end portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of each of the arm rest modules <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is positioned on the mounting section <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and extends past each end of the first and second elongated seat and back support modules <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The armrest modules <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> have upper end portions <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to which armrests <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> may be attached, as hereinafter described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a front view of the central base module <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> illustrating the top <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> thereof as well as the opposing ends <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> thereof. At the bottom wall <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is a hub <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> for securing the central base to the top of a hub for the piston/cylinder arrangement <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Each elongated seat and back frame support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has a front seat member support end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a rear backrest frame support end <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As can be observed, the rear ends <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are separated at a greater lateral distance then the front ends <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Each end <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has an aperture <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, respectively, therethrough for receiving appropriate pivot pins (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As can be best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a backrest module or assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is a skeletal frame in arrangement, comprises a generally splayed outwardly U-shaped frame formed of a pair of spaced uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and having a lower connecting bight segment <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). An upper transverse member <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and a lower transverse member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are both fixedly connected to uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to provide rigidity thereto. The lower member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is affixed to each upright <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> by an appropriate &ldquo;C&rdquo; shaped member <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> held in position by threaded fastener <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> fed into threaded bosses <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> one each upright <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The members <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> serve to space the lower transverse member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> forwardly of the uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> for reasons which will be apparent. The lower transverse member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the upper end assembly <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of the uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> receive and support a carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in which a mesh fabric <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is positioned. The uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> also are configured to support an adjustable lumbar member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, all as described hereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The right and left outer ends <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> on lower transverse member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of the backrest assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> provide pivotal attachment to the rear ends <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of corresponding ones of the first and second elongated seat and back support modules <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via pivot pins and bearing sleeves through apertures <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> in the support member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and openings <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> in the ends <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29, 30</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a seat member assembly or module <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is illustrated in detail and includes generally a seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, a seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and a fastener <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. Details of the seat assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are provided hereinafter and in copending U.S. Pat. application entitled &ldquo;Adjustable Chair Seat With Locking Mechanism,&rdquo; filed on even date herewith, Ser. No. ______ (Attorney Docket No. 087522-785-200), commonly assigned, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in full by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> having a front end <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> having pivot pin apertures <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and a pocket or housing style rear end <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>. A pivot attachment means such as pivot pins (not shown) passes through the openings <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in seat support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and into apertures <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and are used to couple the forward end <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> of the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to the front ends <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of each of the respective elongated seat and back support members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A housing type structure is provided at the rear end <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> of the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and has depending outer walls <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> which include a lower bottom wall portion <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> extending partially across the width of the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to define the bottom of the housing. Spaced inwardly from the outer walls <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> are a pair of inner walls <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>, provided with apertures <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> therethrough for purposes of receiving pivot pins (not shown) therethrough. A large opening <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> for receiving the clevis and projection members <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and is disposed between the inner walls <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. At the top of the very rear of the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is a tab-like projection <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> having apertures <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> therethrough for reasons later explained. Positioned in a portion of the housing at the rear end <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> of the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are a pair of spaced pivot links <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, one lower end <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> of each of which is pivotably attached to the lower portion of the rear seat plate via pins at apertures <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> and the other upper end <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of each which is attached to one tab <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of the clevis <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> on the back rest frame module <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, as is described in more detail hereafter. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The rear end <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> of the housing section of seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is constructed for pivotal coupling to the clevis arrangement <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. This pivotal coupling comprises the pair of laterally spaced link members <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, each having the first lower end <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> for pivotal coupling to the respective sides of the housing structure <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> on the inside spaced inner walls <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> and the second upper ends <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> for pivotal coupling to the respective sides of the aperture/tabs <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of the clevis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> A pivot pin (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> extends through the openings <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in the tab members <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of the clevis, and passes through openings in the second end <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of each of the link members <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> extends into spaced and defined surface areas <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> on the inner walls <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> for defining movement of the links. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, the upper surface <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> of each inner wall supports the ends of pin <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and provides the guide path and limit stops for movement thereof and thus of the links <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The first or lower end <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> of each link member <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the bottom portion of inner walls <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> via pins (not shown) that are passed through the apertures <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> disposed near the bottom wall of each spaced inner wall <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. The upper ends <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the links <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, when the chair is unweighted by a user (or if weighted but not reclined), will be at the upper end of the surface <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>. As the back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> reclines or tilts, the pin <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> will move along the surface <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> toward the bottom thereof. Because the link also is pinned to the seat <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> at aperture <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight>, it will cause the rear <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> of the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to rise and rotate about front end <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The relative positions of the seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, during reclining of the back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, can be seen in the side views of FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in these views, the chair seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is pivotably connected via pins <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> at pivot points P<highlight><subscript>30 </subscript></highlight>to the forward end <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of support members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (only one of which can be seen) and is pivotably connected at rear pivot points P<highlight><subscript>32 </subscript></highlight>to the lower ends <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> of the links <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> at the aperture <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight> (only one of which can be seen). Each link <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in turn is pivotably connected at its upper end <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> at point P<highlight><subscript>34 </subscript></highlight>to the clevis <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> on the back frame assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The back frame assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also is pivotably connected via member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> at point P<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>to the two laterally spaced end positions <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of support members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As shown in the dimensional schematic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, when the chair back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in a fally upright position the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> (and thus the seat) in one preferred form is inclined to the rear and forms an angle of about 15.7 degrees from horizontal, although this angle can be in a range of between about 10 and 20 degrees. The preferred distance between pivot points P<highlight><subscript>30 </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>is about 12.889 inches and the distance between pivot points P<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>34 </subscript></highlight>of the links <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is approximately 2.01 inches, although these distances can be in ranges of between about 10 and 15 inches and about 1.5 to 2.5 inches, respectively. Further, the preferred distance between pivot points P<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>34 </subscript></highlight>is approximately 4.71 inches while the horizontal distance between pivot points P<highlight><subscript>30 </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>is about 14.5 inches. The distance between pivot points P<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>34 </subscript></highlight>may be in the range of between about 3 and 6 inches while the distance between pivot points P<highlight><subscript>30 </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>may be in a range of between about 12 and 17 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As shown in the three stages of back tilt illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as the back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> reclines rearwardly, the links <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> move in a counterclockwise direction of rotation causing the rear end portion of the seat plate <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> to pivot about pins <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and elevate relative to its front <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>. In the fully reclined position of the back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in the schematic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> (and cushion) preferably reduces its angle of inclination with the horizontal from about 15.7 degrees (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) to about 8.7 degrees while the afore-described distances between all pivot points remains constant. The reduced inclination angle may be in a range of between about 6 and 10 degrees. This synchronous motion of the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and thus seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides for an exceptionally comfortable reclining motion of the chair user to aid in avoiding fatigue as the user is performing various work-related tasks. The ride motion is achieved by this simple seatback-seatrest four bar mechanism, which immediately responds to a user exerting a back force and/or self-weight. A back force applied by the user induces a lift in the rear part of the seat, and vise versa, during reclining, in a synchronic-type motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The chair link mechanism restores ride stability, and attains a desirable ride quality, equally well for a wide range of users, by varying the back force reaction in the mechanism. The back force reaction results from users imposing their own back force and/or self-weight on the chair mechanism. By proportioning linkages lengths, and selecting the locations of the rotationally-free hinges, i.e., the pivots, the back force reaction is designed to vary in order to achieve balance. This continuous force balancing process, which characterizes the ride motion at all positions, establishes and maintains an equilibrated ride. As a result, the need for a user to consciously adjust a back tilt tension knob, to feel comfortably balanced when reclining, is replaced with this more adaptive and dynamic feature. By doing so, the chair design is taken one step further toward conformance to all users without involving them in unnecessary conscious feature-adjustment efforts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The mechanism configuration determines the location of the instantaneous center of chair rotation. As the configuration changes as a result of changing the sitting posture and position, the chair design allows the locus of its instantaneous center of rotation to generally coincide with the user&apos;s rotation center, i.e, hip joint, at all locations within the ride range (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). This feature is calibrated for equal performance to many users, where the instantaneous center of chair rotation is set to move along the locus, i.e. trajectory. By maintaining this quality in the ride, abdominal , back, and other muscuoleskeletal straining, are all eliminated in the full ride range. A more uniform foot reaction is maintained in the ride, therefore, enhancing the ride quality even further. Also, the opening of the torso-legs angle enhances fluid circulation and other ergonomic factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> are schematic views of the synchronous seat and back tilt feature employing the four-bar mechanism which allows the rear of the seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to elevate as the backrest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is reclined. The mechanism is designed to immediately respond to the users weight and provide the correct back support throughout the range of back reclining. This function allows for reclining of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> about an instantaneous center point C that, as noted, is very closely coincident with the pivot axis of the user&apos;s hips and avoids undesirable &ldquo;shirt pull&rdquo; of the user. Also, because the front of the seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not elevated during back reclining, no additional pressure is applied to the front underside of the user&apos;s thighs, and also a relatively constant gaze angle is maintained during reclining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the foregoing advantages, the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> schematically comprises four basic members and four rotationally-free pivots. The basic members include a floor supported member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a seat rest <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a linking member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a backrest <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The floor supported member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has an upwardly directed portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that terminates at an end defining pivot point P<highlight><subscript>30 </subscript></highlight>to which the seat rest <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is pivotably connected at its forward portion. The member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also has an upwardly directed portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which terminates at an end defining pivot point P<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>to which the backrest <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is pivotably connected. A lower portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the back rest <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is pivotably connected at point P<highlight><subscript>34 </subscript></highlight>to the upper end of linking member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a downwardly extending portion <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the seat rest <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is pivotably connected at point P<highlight><subscript>32 </subscript></highlight>to the other lower end of the linking member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The kinematics of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. As force F is applied on the backrest <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the back tilt angle &bgr; increases, eye location shifts backwards an amount &Dgr;H1, and eye elevation decreases by an amount &Dgr;V3. The change in back tilt angle &bgr; transmits motion by way of the upper and lower back pivots P<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>34</subscript></highlight>, respectively, to the linking member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. As a result of motion set in linking member <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the rear seat pivot P<highlight><subscript>32 </subscript></highlight>moves in coordination with pivot P<highlight><subscript>34 </subscript></highlight>in a composite rotational and translation motion. As the seat rest <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> rotates about pivot P<highlight><subscript>30</subscript></highlight>, a lift &Dgr;V2 is caused in the rear part of the seat rest <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> relative to its front edge &Dgr;V1 in the amount &Dgr;V2&mdash;&Dgr;V1, therefore introducing a seat rest angle &agr;. During back reclining an increasing portion of the user&apos;s weight supported by the chair is transferred from the seat support to the back support while the mechanical advantage of the mechanism lifting the seat support decreases. The user will therefore sense a static balance position in any position of recline and will require little effort to move to a new position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As the user sits in the chair, a back force, F, and/or weight, W, is exerted on the chair mechanism and, therefore, sets it in a self-equilibrating motion, with ride qualities that are designed beforehand. These forces may only be balanced by a proper back force reaction, and by the chair reconfiguring its geometry to the level required by the exerted force. By doing so, the motion response parameters appearing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13, 14</cross-reference>, are varied in known proportions and rates to achieve the ride quality. The design ride range subtends a backrest angle from about 90&deg; to about 120&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> To fine-tune the ride qualify, and to provide for static overall stiffness, the mechanism may also be equipped with external elements, including springs. The addition of these external devices would further calibrate the ride quality towards its desirable, pre-designed features, while, at the same time, maintaining all other functional qualities intact. Thus, in order to assist the chair linkage mechanism in allowing the backrest member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to maintain a fully upright position when the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not in use, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>one or more extension springs <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> may be connected between pivot shaft <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> and the rear edge portion <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The pivot shaft <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> essentially also defines pivot point P<highlight><subscript>34 </subscript></highlight>and will cause a return force to be exerted on back frame assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by the springs <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In order to relate the explanation of the schematic linkage as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, to the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the respective parts on the chair correspond to the parts as the schematic linkage

As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> has a threaded stub <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> on the bottom side <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> thereof to which a stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the lever handle <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> can be attached by a shoulder bolt and washer <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> that is threadedly inserted into stub through aligned orifices <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> in the handle, stop plate and stub. The lever handle <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> may be attached to the stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> from either side of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and herein is shown on the left side. It will be noted that stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> has an outer edge <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> with a series of steps of different radii for interacting with the engaging member <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> carried by the end of the clevis <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the back rest frame <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, as will be seen more clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment, the engagement member <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is in the form of a nose-like protrusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The outer edge <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> has specific steps <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, as can be best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, and each is at a different distance from the central axis defined by aperture <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> with respect to the other. A locking means <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, in the form of a spring-biased plunger is mounted in a boss <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> on the bottom of seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and engages detents <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> found in the upper portion of stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that the outer edge <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> could be a smooth cam having an edge of a continuously changing radius.

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The indexing detents <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> are of concave shape and are adjacent each other. Since the spring-loaded plunger is in the form of a spring-loaded ball <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, the plunger is enabled to freely move from one concave detent to another by compressing the spring and rotating the lever <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and thus the stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to permit the plunger to be positioned in any selected detent and by releasing the plunger to cause the stop plate to hold the back frame in a selected tilt position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Because the projection <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is below the pivot axis P<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>formed at ends <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, as the back frame <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> pivots about axis P<highlight><subscript>20</subscript></highlight>, the protrusion <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> moves inwardly towards the seat stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> thus allowing adjustment of the tilt mechanism by moving handle or lever <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The handle <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is fixed from rotation relative to stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> via a number of matching spring fingers <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, engaging recesses in the handle. When the lever <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and the stop plate <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> rotates, it causes the various steps <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> on the outer edge thereof to be in selective engagement with the projection <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. The details of the tilt limit module are disclosed and claimed in commonly assigned co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/882,500 filed Jun. 15, 2001, and entitled &ldquo;Multi-Position Tilt-Limiting Mechanism,&rdquo; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in full by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15, 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the complete backrest assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated in perspective and shows the novel feature of the lumbar support construction and carrier assembly which will be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Yet another novel and highly functional feature of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that offers ergonomic advantages over the prior art is the construction of the chair back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As previously noted, the back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is designed to include a panel of fabric mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> which is preferably of an open weave type known in the art. The construction of the fabric mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may have a variety of weave configurations. One configuration that has proved to be advantageous is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comprising vertical strands <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> of multifilament yarn and horizontal monofilaments <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>. The monofilaments <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> in this construction can be seen to cross over the strands <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> and also crisscross over each other thereby locking the strands <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A preferred mesh weave is shown in front and back views in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, respectively. In this version, the horizontal multifilament or weft material <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> is simply interwoven in steps with a vertical monofilament warp <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment the warp does not cross the weft at each adjacent position. In this pattern for each warp cross over a weft, there will be seven warps between that do not cross the same weft before a repeat. Thus warps &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &ldquo;8&rdquo; cross weft C, while warps <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> cross weft D. The warp material preferably is made of Hytrel&reg; monofilament of 730 Denier. This provides structure and a relatively &ldquo;shiny&rdquo; look to the back of the chair. The weft <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> is a multifilament which includes a polymer yarn and an amount of Hytrel&reg;. The multifilament is a suitable synthetic resin and provides a relatively soft and comfortable feel to the front surface of the chair back. Because of the pattern, it also has a more finished and pleasing esthetic look as compared to open mesh of different patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In order to support the mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> around its edges, the aforementioned carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is used. The physical connection of the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to the mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may be performed in a number of ways. However, a most reliable connection is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/656,491, filed by Timothy P. Coffield on Sep. 6, 2000 and titled &ldquo;Bonding Strip for Load Bearing Fabric.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15, 20</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> illustrate a carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> comprising two halves <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> disposed on opposite sides of the edge portion of mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. The two halves <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may, in one form, be formed with internal grooves <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The halves are placed in a fixture <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> together with an adhesive <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The adhesive extends through warps and wefts of the fabric <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and into pockets formed by the grooves <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and, once cured, creates a mechanical interconnection that is of high strength and durability, and also helps hold the two halves <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> together. Additional features (not shown) such as screws or the like also may be used to assure the parts to not separate. While halves <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are shown as approximately equal size in the preferred form, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>, the one side is larger than the other, providing a more pleasing esthetic look to the mounted carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is formed as a generally rectangular semi-rigid member of resilient, stretchable material. In order to support the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the invention and referring once again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 6</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the main back frame uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> each has spherical end assemblies portions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> thereon which are &ldquo;snap fit&rdquo; received within circular apertures <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> formed in the upper right and upper left hand corners of the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. These joints allow upper edge <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to flex allowing the chair back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to comfortably conform to the position of the user&apos;s shoulders. The back may be secured along bottom edge <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> to the lower transverse frame member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> by a series of five outwardly depending tabs <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> formed on the bottom of transverse member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, which tabs fit into complementary recesses <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> formed in lower surface <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Details of the upper ball and socket connections may be seen in the cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, while the lower attachment construction can be seen in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. In assembly, the lower edge <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is first assembled to the tabs, tension applied to the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the upper openings <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> snapped into the spherical ends <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> of uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> It can now be appreciated that a chair back construction as just described offers considerable ergonomic advantages. The use of open mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> allows the chair back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to not only breathe, but to flex in conformity with the back of the user. The back <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also highly cost effective to manufacture and assemble. Further, the back member is positioned on the frame assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in a manner that keeps the carrier and mesh in tension, providing both flexibility of the back surface but sufficient rigidity for the carrier that it maintains its shape. Because the lower transverse member <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is curved and set forward of the uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> (via C members <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>), the lower end <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of the carrier assumes a curved configuration that also is spaced forwardly of the uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, so the user never feels the back frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> As observed the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has a slight curvilinear shape from top to bottom so as to assume compressing tension in the mesh fabric. When a user&apos;s back contacts the fabric at various locations and during casual movement in the chair. The curvilinear shape also is intended to provide support in the general lumbar region, as best seen in the side view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a major advantage of this tensioned structure is the capability to provide a unique adjustable lumbar support. The back assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a transverse lumbar support tube <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> having gripping means <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> on each of its opposed ends, together with a pair of spaced slide members <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>. A cross-section of the gripping means <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> wherein the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is provided with a pair of opposed recesses <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> into which opposed projections <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> of the gripping means <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> are slidably received, with the carrier trapped between the projections <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. Thus, the lumbar support tube <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is slideable on opposed edges of the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the support tube taken substantially along the line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. There, it can be seen that slide members <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> are configured to engage vertical supports <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the engagement arrangement of the slide members <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> includes simple vertical grooves <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> formed in the supports <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and engaging a central rib <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> on the slide member. It can now be appreciated, particularly with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, that the lumbar support tube <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is vertically movable between upper and lower positions as it slides on edges of the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by means of the gripping means <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and also slides on the vertical supports <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> by means of the slide members <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>. The result of such movement is to allow the chair user to adjust the vertical height of the lumbar support tube <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> by simple manual manipulation. The lumbar tube <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is held in proper connection to the supports <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> by the tension of the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> without the need for screws, adjustment knobs or the like. In this tension mode the lumbar tube <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> causes the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and mesh <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> to be forced forwardly of the chair uprights in the lumbar region of the user, while direct contact of the lumbar support tube <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> with the back of the user is avoided. An in-depth description of this assembly may be found in aforementioned copending application Ser. No. 09/881,795, filed Jun. 15, 2001, incorporated in full by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The vertically adjustable lumbar support member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is intended to change the lineal curvature of the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as the tube <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is slide up or down between the carrier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and uprights <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. By changing the carrier configuration, no high pressure contact points are placed on the user&apos;s back; rather, a taut but flexible mesh is properly positioned for preferred support and comfort, even as the chair reclines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Turning now to other aspects of a preferred seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> developed for use with the ergonomic chair, various aspects of the horizontal seat adjustment and unique cushion arrangement will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> has been generally described heretofore. The plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is intended to cooperate with a seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> which has the seat cushion assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> affixed thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitable material such as a synthetic resin which may be molded as an integral piece. The seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> includes an upper portion <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and a lower portion <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. The upper portion is covered with a cushion assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> described hereinafter and forms the seating surface of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The seat pan also includes four spaced L-shaped fingers, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> depending from the lower portion <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, a fastener receiving opening <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a rim <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> around the fastener receiving opening and two abutment elements <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. The seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> also includes a front portion <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and a rear portion <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. A large opening <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is located in the rear portion <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of the seat pan to accommodate movement of the links <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Peripheral fastener openings, such as the openings and bosses <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> are provided to fasten the seat cushion assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to the seat pad <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The seat pan further includes a number of strengthening ribs such as the rib <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> in the upper portion. Flanking the fastener receiving opening <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are two depending bumps <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The fastener receiving opening <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the two bumps <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> are formed on a beam <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. Because the material of the seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is a synthetic resin, the beam <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is resilient and thus able to flex in response to any applied force. Such a force may come from the fastener <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> being received through the fastener receiving opening as well as from contact with the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which may provide forces on the two bumps <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The abutment elements <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> are also formed at the end of respective beams <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> for added flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may be formed as an integral unit of any suitable strong material, such as aluminum. As noted, the seat plate includes a front portion <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>, a rear portion <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, a top portion <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and a bottom portion <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. The seat plate includes four guide slots <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight>, each with a large head opening and a narrow body opening (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>), which cooperate with the L-shaped fingers <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, respectively, of the seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> for restraining and guiding the seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> in movement in a horizontal direction relative to the fixed seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> also includes an elongated fastener receiving opening <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and two abutment limit slots <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. These limit the horizontal movement of the seat pan by limiting the movement of the abutment elements <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. At the rear portion of the seat plate is a large opening <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> that receives the clevis <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and links <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. On either side of the elongated fastener receiving opening <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is a set of recesses <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> in the top portion. The pair of sets of recesses form a detent with the pair of depending bumps <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> on the lower portion of the seat pan. The limit slots <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> receive the abutment elements <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, respectively and limit movement of the seat pad so that the L-shaped fingers do not disengage from the guide slots. The torque limiting fastener <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is provided for seat adjustment. The design of the fastener <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is such that once inserted it cannot easily be removed. Details of the fastener are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. ______, filed on even date herewith, entitled &ldquo;Adjustable Chair Seat With Locking Mechanism&rdquo; (Attorney Docket No.: 087522-785-200), incorporated herein in full by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In operation the seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and fastener <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> are all formed using well known techniques. Assembly is simple and easy. The seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are aligned to allow the L-shaped fingers <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> to pass through the enlarged openings at the end of the guide slots <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> and for the abutment elements <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> to be pressed into the limit slots <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the fastener <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is threaded into the fastener receiving opening <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> with the seat plate <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> sandwiched between. Once the seat pad and the fastener are engaged, they will not separate; however, the fastener <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> may be loosened or tightened simply by rotating the handle clockwise or counterclockwise. When the fastener is loosened, the seat pan may be adjusted generally horizontally relative to the seat plate for the user&apos;s comfort. Because of the bumps <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and recesses <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight>, a detent is formed which is easily heard and felt by the chair user and this helps in the adjustment process. When the adjustment is complete, the fastener is counter rotated to squeeze the seat pan and the seat plate together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Another improvement in the ergonomic chair is a highly effective seat cushion assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> is an exploded view of one embodiment of a seat cushion assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> preferred for use with the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Seat cushion assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> comprises foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> which can be formed of materials typically used in such seat cushions, such as open-celled or closed-celled polyurethane foam. The foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> has an upper surface <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> and a plurality of vertical columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> disposed substantially centrally in the foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> extend upwardly such that the top surface of the columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> define a curved surface substantially parallel to upper surface <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, the columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> are formed integrally with foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. The foam material of which foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> are made will be resiliently deformable to some extent. The columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> are structured such that, in the absence of other structural elements of the assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, each column <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> is capable of deflecting substantially independently of the other columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> in response to compressive forces applied by a chair user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The vertical columns <highlight><bold>575</bold></highlight> are structured so as to define a plurality of air spaces <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> therebetween, which together define a plenum or air reservoir <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. A plurality of channels <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> is disposed within foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and extend from air reservoir <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> toward the periphery of foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated preferred embodiment of a seat cushion, the channels <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> are directed to the front and lateral sides of the foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Design parameters of vertical columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> include their number, planar spacing, depth, aspect ratios, and material density and stiffness. Depending on their size and shape, the number of vertical columns is preferably about 40-80. The columns preferably can have a diameter at their lower end in the range of about 1.0-2.0 inches. The columns can have a diameter at their upper end in the range of about 0.9-2.0 inches. The height of the columns can range up to about 4 inches, and most preferably will be in the range of about 0.5-1.5 inches. The columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> in the seat cushion <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> can be of different sizes and shapes. The number of air channels <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> will depend upon their size. The total volume capacity of channels <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> will be a function of the volume capacity of air reservoir <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The seat cushion assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> further comprises an elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> that overlays the upwardly extending columns or risers <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the periphery <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> of elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is seated within a fitting edge <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> at the upper surface <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> of foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. Elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> comprises a top surface <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight>. The bottom surface <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> of elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> defines the top surface of air reservoir <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. The elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> comprises a material having significant resilience and flow properties. Suitable materials for elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> include, for example, a gelatinous sheet and a polymeric membrane, or other gelatinous materials with variable viscoelastic properties. One suitable material includes a gel sold under the trademark LEVAGEL&reg; by Royal Medica of Italy. Information about this material is available at www.royalmedica.it. The elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and upwardly extending risers or columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> are each characterized by both an elastic stiffness value and a dissipative stiffness value In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the ratio of elastic stiffness to dissipative stiffness of the vertical columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> is greater than the ratio of elastic stiffness to dissipative stiffness of the elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Depending on the material selected and the properties of the seat cushion desired, elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> can have a thickness in the preferred range of about 0.2-0.4 inches. The area of elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> can be less than the area of top surface <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> and most preferably in the range of about 30-55%. In one embodiment, elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> is about 0.25 inches thick, and has an area of 210 sq. in., relative to a total area of top surface <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> of 392 sq. in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In use, the foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> of seat cushion assembly <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is supported by a stiff seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> rigidly fixed on the seating system assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> comprises an inner pan <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> fastened to the seat pan <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> When a user is seated on a seat cushion of the instant invention, the user&apos;s weight is transmitted as vertical compressive forces and transverse shear forces to the user/seat cushion interface. These forces are transmitted through elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> to vertical columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. Elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and vertical columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> function cooperatively with one another to achieve a self-limiting mechanical response to obtain desired mechanical qualities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The redistribution of applied forces can be further enhanced by an air-permeable layer <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, disposed above elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The air-permeable layer <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> may comprise an open-cell or non-woven viscoelastic material having specified thickness and viscoelastic properties, which air-permeable layer <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> can function to further dissipate applied forces before such forces reach elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Optionally, an intermediate foam layer <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> can be placed between air-permeable layer <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight> and elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. A cover fabric, not shown, can overlie the entire seating structure. The layers <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, and the cover fabric can be pre-bonded to one another such as with adhesives. Alternatively, the layers can simply be stacked on top of each other, in which case there should be a sufficient amount of friction between the layers to prevent slippage of the layers with respect to one another in response to shear forces applied during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The structure of the instant invention will transmit shear forces emanating at the user/seat interface across the interfaces between each of the layers until elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> will deform viscously in response to applied shear forces, thereby counteracting the shear component of the user&apos;s weight by dissipative means, such that the user&apos;s skin will not experience the shear component. As a result, the user&apos;s tissues will experience substantially only compressive stresses in the normal direction. This reduction in shear stress can reduce the potential for the development of pressure ulcers, and reduce undesirable interference with blood vessel activity in the vicinity of these tissues. Moreover, the unique arrangement and air pressure helps to avoid heat build-up which frequently occurs in chairs and has an advantage over mesh seats which may feel cool and drafty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> When the user leaves the seat cushion of the instant invention, the resiliency of the foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, vertical columns <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> and the elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> allows fill recovery of both shear and compression deformational mechanisms of the cushion. The passive air pump depressurizes, allowing outside air to pass through the outside cover, the air permeable layer, and optional intermediate foam layer to enter the air reservoir and channels, and open cells in the foam body <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> if open-celled foam is used. The elastomeric layer <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> will also return to its original shape prior to the application of compression and shear forces by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The preferred seat cushion assembly and the advantages thereof are more particularly described in copending application Ser. No. 09/882,503, filed Jun. 15, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Locking Device for Chair Seat Horizontal Adjustment Mechanism,&rdquo; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in full by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> As previously noted, another aspect of the improved ergonomic chair includes improved arm assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that are both vertically adjustable and in which the armrests <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are rotatable generally in a horizontal plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The disclosure herein concentrates on the armrest assemblies which are simply constructed and reliable and allow adjustment both vertically and horizontally. Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, the armrest assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes an upstanding support <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> which has an open upper end portion <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, a curved lower end portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a longitudinally extending opening <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from the upper end portion. Within the support opening <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are mounted oppositely disposed liner racks <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, each having a plurality of notches extending in a longitudinal direction. As viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, the longitudinal direction is generally vertical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> A guide tube <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is positioned in the support opening <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> such that the guide tube is generally vertically movable relative to the support. An armrest <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is mounted to the guide tube so that relative movement of the guide tube causes vertical adjustment of the armrest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Within the movable guide tube is a elongated element <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> in the form of a rod, the rod being mounted within the guide tube to be rotatable only. As will be explained below, the rod <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> does not slide vertically or longitudinally relative to the guide tube <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. Mounted to the elongated rod <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is a locking element <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> which is rotatable with the rod to selectively engage and disengage the opposed notches <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of the liner racks <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. Mounted at an upper end portion <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of the rod is an activator nut <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> which engages the rod and causes the rod to rotate, the engagement surface of the nut moving between raised and lowered positions (raised in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>). A spring <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is mounted between the activator nut and the guide tube and biases the activator nut to the raised position whereby the rod is rotated to and maintained in a locked position. The activator nut is moved by a lever <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> which is operatively connected to the upstanding support by being pivotally mounted to an armrest base <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. A cap <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> is also mounted to the guide tube and is operatively connected to the armrest base to allow the base to rotate in a generally horizontal direction relative to the cap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The upstanding support <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has a generally cylindrical shape extending in a generally vertical direction. The lower end portion <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the upstanding support curves to a generally horizontal disposition allowing it to be attached to the central base member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The support is made of any suitable material, such as aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Formed around the upstanding support is a second cylindrical element <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> often referred to as a shroud. The shroud slides along the outside surface of the upstanding support and provides a pleasing aesthetic appearance to the armrest assembly. An upper part <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of the shroud <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> includes a first horizontal annular bearing surface <highlight><bold>419</bold></highlight>, a vertical annular bearing surface <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and a second horizontal annular bearing surface <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. These bearing surfaces engage corresponding bearing surfaces of the armrest base <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. The shroud also includes a top flange <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> having fastener receiving openings <highlight><bold>423</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, within the upstanding support <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are the two oppositely disposed liner racks <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, with each rack including the plurality of notches <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The racks have small tabs <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> which engage openings <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> in the upstanding support. In addition to the notches, the racks also include bearing surfaces <highlight><bold>429</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> for the vertically sliding guide tube <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The guide tube is generally cylindrical in shape and includes a central opening <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The guide tube includes an upper end portion <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> including two fastener openings <highlight><bold>433</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight>, an annular groove <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> for receiving the spring <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> and two oppositely disposed keys <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight>. Along an outside surface <highlight><bold>438</bold></highlight> of the guide tube are grooves, such as the grooves <highlight><bold>439</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, for limiting the upward travel of the guide tube. Toward a lower portion <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> of the guide tube, there are two circumferentially extending slots <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight>. The slots each extend about an arc of about forty-five degrees. As will be explained below, the locking element <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> extends through the slots to make engagement with the notches <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. When engagement is made, the guide tube <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and the attached armrest <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are locked relative to the support <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight> also enable the locking element to rotate out of engagement with the notches through the forty-five degree arcs and thereby disengage the guide tube from the support allowing the guide tube to be moved vertically within the support opening <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. In this manner the armrest may be vertically adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Mounted to the guide tube <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is the activator nut <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33, 34</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The activator nut includes an annular flange <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>, having a spring retaining surface <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> and key slots, of which one key slot <highlight><bold>446</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, to accommodate the keys <highlight><bold>436</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>437</bold></highlight> of the guide tube. The actuator nut also includes a top surface <highlight><bold>447</bold></highlight> to engage the lever <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and a central threaded opening <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight>. The threaded opening engages the rod <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> causing the rod to rotate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Mounted within the guide tube is the elongated rod <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38, 39</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The rod is mounted for rotational movement only and does not slide longitudinally in relation to the guide tube. At an upper end portion <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of the rod is an external screw thread <highlight><bold>449</bold></highlight> which engages the internal screw thread <highlight><bold>448</bold></highlight> of the activator nut. In the lower portion of the rod is a snap fit connector <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> for engaging the locking element <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The locking element has opposed extending arms <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and a central opening <highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>. The locking element central opening receives the snap fit connector of the rod, which deforms and then snaps back into place to make a connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The spring <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is mounted within the annular groove <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> at the upper end portion <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> of the guide tube <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. An upper end of the spring bears against the surface <highlight><bold>445</bold></highlight> of the annular flange <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. Because of the keys and key slots, the activator nut moves between raised and lowered positions in a linear fashion as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>. When the activator nut is moved to its lowered position, the spring is compressed and forms a biasing force against the activator nut tending to return it to its raised position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the armrest base <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> is shown in more detail. The base is an integral element having a large oval opening <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> at an extended end portion to accommodate a touch pad <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 48</cross-reference>, of the operating lever <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. At the opposite end of the armrest base is a cuplike structure including a bottom bearing surface <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> and a downward projecting flange <highlight><bold>457</bold></highlight> forming a vertical bearing surface <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight> for rotation about the shroud. The armrest base also includes a cup upper surface <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight>. The upper surface <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight> includes two sets of recesses <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight>, each in a curved format. These recesses form a detent with the cap <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> as will be explained below. The cup bottom also includes an opening having a central portion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> and two end portions <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight>. The end portions are curved slots to accommodate two fasteners <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, allowing the base to pivot until the ends of the slots abut the fasteners. The central portion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> allows the lever to engage the top surface <highlight><bold>447</bold></highlight> of the activator nut <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The cap <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> includes two side openings <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>, FIGS. <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, for receiving the fasteners <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> and a central opening <highlight><bold>469</bold></highlight> for passing the lever. The side openings are aligned with the end portion slots <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight>. The cap also includes two sets of resiliently mounted tabs <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight>. The tabs align with and engage the two sets of curved recesses <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>461</bold></highlight> on the armrest base to form a series of detents. This allows horizontal movement of the armrest base from one detent to another within about a forty-five degree arc determined by the arcs of the end portion slots <highlight><bold>463</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>464</bold></highlight> and depending shoulders <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight> surrounding each opening <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>468</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Mounted to the armrest base <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> is the lever <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> which extends from the oval opening <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight> at one end of the armrest base to the central opening <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> at the other end portion of the armrest base. At the extended end of the lever is the touch pad <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>, while at the other end is a depending projection <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 48</cross-reference>, that makes contact with the upper surface <highlight><bold>447</bold></highlight> of the activator nut <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. The lever is mounted to pivot about pivot point <highlight><bold>475</bold></highlight> such that an upward force on the touch pad <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> causes the projection <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> to move downwardly. The downward movement of the lever projection causes the activator nut to move from its raised position to its lowered position thereby causing the rod <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> to rotate and disengage the locking element <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> from the notches <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 and 50</cross-reference>, the pivoting movement of the locking element <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is clearly shown. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference> the armrest is locked with the locking element engaging the notches <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. When the lever is activated, the locking element is pivoted out of engagement with the notches as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> It can now be appreciated that the armrest assembly is simply constructed, easy to form and assemble and easy to use. In operation, the relative vertical positioning of the armrest, the guide tube and the connected shroud to the upstanding support and the notched liner racks determines the height of the armrest relative to the seat of the chair. Usually the armrest is locked by the locking element engaging a pair of notches. Depressing the lever touch pad causes the projection end to bear down on the top surface of the activator nut. Since the nut cannot rotate, it is depressed causing the threadedly engaged rod to rotate. Rotation of the rod causes the locking element to rotate 45 degrees out of engagement with the pair of notches. The armrest may then be manually adjusted upwardly or downwardly. Once the force on the lever is released, the spring mounted to the guide tube causes the actuator nut to return to its raised position. This linear movement of the activator nut causes reverse rotation of the rod and the locking element causing the locking element to engage a new pair of notches. When this occurs, the armrest is locked in its new position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Adjusting the armrest in a horizontal direction requires only the movement of the armrest to pivot it outwardly or inwardly within an arc of about 45 degrees. The resiliently mounted tabs of the cap move from one pair of recesses to another pair in the armrest base. This detent mechanism allows the armrest to pivot between six discreet positions. Movement occurs when the force on the armrest is sufficient to move the resilient tabs out of engagement with a pair of recesses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> What has been described is a simply constructed and reliable armrest assembly that is adjustable both vertically and horizontally. These adjustments may be easily made through simple manipulation of portions of the armrest assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> It can now be appreciated that a chair l<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> constructed according to the invention offers considerable advantages in user comfort by virtue of its synchronous linkage construction particularly where it is used for prolonged periods of time. The chair <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also cost effective to manufacture and assemble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes and modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such changes and modifications as come within the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
