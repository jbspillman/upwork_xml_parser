<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, in general, to transit vehicle door systems and, more particularly, the instant invention relates to linearly actuated transit vehicle door locks having a pushback feature. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Door locks for transit vehicles are a major operational concern, particularly, to the mass transit industry. These door locks must provide a fail-proof system for locking of the door panel in the event of a door mechanism failure. This is required in order to prevent unintentional opening movement of such doors which would permit a passenger to fall out of the vehicle when it is in motion. Nevertheless, these doors must allow for normal door movement upon receipt of the legal open command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This situation is exacerbated by the fact that certain permitted lateral movement of the doors in the closed and locked position exists. This is due to overall system tolerances as well as preload between door edges typically used in a mass transit vehicle. Such lateral movement produces preload forces which are exerted on the lock mechanism prior to the door opening. Furthermore, in cases where excessive traffic loads exist, passengers may be pressing against the doors thereby resulting in an undesirable increase in preload forces acting on the door lock mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Many prior art door systems have quite complex locks which exhibit numerous failure points. An example of a prior art door lock system is provided by U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,073 &ldquo;LOCK ASSEMBLY&rdquo; utilizing linearly moving primary and secondary components and various means to minimize frictional forces acting on the moving components. It can be seen that there is a need for a simple, reliable, door lock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To minimize potential hazards encountered by the passenger during the door panel closing, it is also desirable for a locking system for transit vehicle doors to have a pushback feature. The pushback feature is provided to allow a person who has a limb, garment or carried object, that is caught by one or more closing doors, to push the doors open a small amount so that the limb, garment or carried object may be extracted. The amount the door panels can be opened when they are in the pushback region is limited to a small distance, typically in the range of from 5 cm to 10 cm, in order to prevent a person from falling out of the transit vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,416 entitled &ldquo;TRANSIT VEHICLE DOOR&rdquo; describes a transit vehicle door system having a lock which provides for a fully locked position and also a pushback position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This patent has an interesting feature in that compression of the door seals is employed in the locking mechanism. The door seals bias the doors toward the open direction and that bias prevents a lock arm of the lock system from moving to the unlocking position. The teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,416 is incorporated herein by reference thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For reasons of allowing emergency passenger egress, when an energy source may not be present to drive doors in the open direction, it is desirable for a locking system for a transit vehicle to be unlocked manually therein allowing for subsequent manual door movement toward an open direction. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED AND VARIOUS ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Prior to proceeding to the more detailed description of the instant invention, it should be noted that identical components which have identical functions have been identified with identical reference numerals throughout the several views illustrated in the drawing figures for the sake and clarity in understanding the invention. Furthermore, the detailed description of the present invention will be presented on a configuration of a biparting doors. It will be obvious to those persons who are skilled in the relevant art from that operation of the locking device in fully locked position or in pushback locked position for a single door will be identical other than the number of additional components associated with second door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The invention disclosed herein overcomes locking device application difficulties through the use of a rotable locking arm and a at least one linear actuator pivotably attached to said locking arm. Employment of self lubricating means to reduce friction between moving components reduces application loads and further provides for ease of operation to move said locking arm away from door lock pins allowing doors to move toward open direction. Furthermore, employment of a simple rotable locking arm eliminates the need for multiple and more complex moving components. The design, therefore, provides the advantage of reliable operation and reduced design costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is shown a pictorial view of a locking device, generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for a pair of transit vehicle doors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The locking device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is for attachment to a stationary part of the door system (not shown), at a point overhead of the door opening (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Locking device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a rotary lock arm, generally designated <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is for capturing pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on biparting door <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on a biparting door <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Door engagement portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of rotary lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> engage pins <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so that rotary lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> cannot be moved clockwise to an unlocking position without energizing a drive system for the doors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to compress door seals and move pins <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> toward each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Rotary lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pivotably attached to the overhead door structure (not shown) at first pivot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, said pivot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed within a self lubricating sleeve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to reduce friction forces during rotation of said lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> about said pivot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is further attached to actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at second pivot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> offset from the first pivot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and disposed within articulated member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the said linear actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, articulated member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is of a spherical bearing type substantially minimizing directional loads imposed onto linear actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the clock-wise rotation of the lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during door unlocking motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may be a pneumatic cylinder, but preferably is a solenoid, has an energized portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which exerts force on proximal moveable actuator portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Energization of actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causes proximal portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to move in the direction <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, thus rotating rotary lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> about first pivot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a clockwise direction. Deenergization of actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> permits actuator biasing means <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to cause proximal portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to move in the direction <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to being rotary lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the locking position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment actuator biasing means is a compression spring of predetermined length to positively bias lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> toward the lock position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment at least one actuator sensor, generally designated <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, attached to the overhead door structure (not shown) and provides a signal indicating the position of the moveable actuator portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Preferably, said sensor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a sensor actuator portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> pivotably connected to sensor housing <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at pivot <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and engaging a displaceable portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to provide a signal indicating the position of the moveable actuator portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Such actuator sensor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected to the control system for the door lock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through electrical terminals <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Actuator sensor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which may be an optical contactless type sensor, but preferably is a solid state switch having normally open contacts, having substantial current rating to disable control power within transit vehicle wherein door(s) has/have not reached closed and locked position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An emergency release is, preferably, attached to distal moveable portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move both moveable portions, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the direction <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to cause clockwise (unlocking) rotation of rotary lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a locking device, generally designated <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, having a pushback mechanism, generally designated <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, for locking a pair of biparting doors of a transit vehicle in a pushback lock position. Locking device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a lock arm <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is pivotably attached to the overhead door structure at first pivot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. It is also attached to actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at second articulated pivot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> offset from first pivot <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and disposed within articulated member <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. As for the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, energization of actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causes proximal moveable portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of actuator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to move in the direction <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> thus causing lock arm <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to move clockwise for unlocking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For locking the doors in a pushback position, pins <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are captured by latch arms <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> respectively of pushback mechanism <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. These latch arms are relatively moveable, unlike the pin engagement portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of rotary lock arm <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Additional details of the latch arms <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which also show the pushback bias means <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment pushback bias means is a coiled compression spring with predetermined length <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to provide for required movement of doors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Latch arm <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which engages pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, has spring engaging portion <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Latch arm <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, which engages pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, has spring engaging portion <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Low friction means <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are disposed between lock arm <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and latch arms <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to reducing friction forces between said lock arm <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and latch arms <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, latch arms <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are constrained to be moveable only in a linear direction <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by the guides <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Preferably, these guides are slots formed in latch arms <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, said slots <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> having predetermined length to cooperate in conjunction with the pushback biasing means <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, at least two guide pins <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> attached to lock arm <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> engage slots <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to provide the required constraint allowing linear motion of latch arms <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in directions <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> only in conjunction with guides <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A person skilled in the art will recognize that compression of spring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will cause latch arm <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to move in the direction <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and latch arm <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to move in the direction <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, thus moving the doors apart. Furthermore, a passenger may force the doors <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> open a small amount, moving pin <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to in the direction <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the direction <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, against the compression of spring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with doors returning to the pushback locked position upon the passenger releasing the doors. </paragraph>
