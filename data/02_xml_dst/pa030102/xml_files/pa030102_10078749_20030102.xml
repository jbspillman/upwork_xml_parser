<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to beverage brewers, and more particularly, beverage brewers that permit selectively changing batch quantities for different brew cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Both the time of contact of the not water with the beverage ingredient and the amount of hot water that is mixed with a given amount of beverage are critical to optimizing the quality of the resulting brewed beverage. Different types of beverage ingredient, such as different types of coffee, and different forms of a given beverage ingredient, such a given ground coffee of different degrees of coarseness required different amounts of hot water for optimum brewing of the resulting beverage. However, until recently, known coffee brewers were unable to easily adjust the quantity of hot water that is dispensed without changing the duration of the dispensing time period. Likewise, it was difficult to easily adjust the duration of the dispense period without changing the quantity of hot water that is to be dispensed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, with my invention shown and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,717 issued Nov. 21, 2000 to Zbigniew G. Lassota for &ldquo;Beverage Maker With Intermittent Beverage Liquid Dispenser and Apparatus and Method for Uniform Contact or Brew Ingredient with Brew&rdquo;, which is hereby incorporated by reference, apparatus and methods were shown that enabled easy selectively control of the average rate at which hot water is dispensed into a brew basket of a brewer so as to selectively change the quantity of hot water that is dispensed independently of the duration of the dispense period to optimize brew abstraction from the dry beverage ingredient such as ground coffee during the brew cycle by intermittently operating a single dispense valve. With the invention of that patent is also possible to selectively change the length of the dispense time period without changing the batch quantity, again for purposes of optimizing abstraction, by intermittently operating a single valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While intermittent operation works successfully for the intended purposes of fine-tuning control over the dispense period of the brew cycle, repeated operation of the dispense valve is required for each dispense period with attendant mechanical wear and fatigue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other brewers are known in which the dispense valve is operated continuously and in which the batch quantity may be changed, but the change in quantity requires a change in the dispense time period and vice versa, and thus the desired degree of control of quantity and dispense period duration is not achievable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is also known to use a variable speed pump vary delivery rate on a continuous basis rather than intermittently to enable independent control of quantity and dispense time duration. Use of a pump believed to be subject to high maintenance costs due to the mechanical movement and liming. It is also known to use a flexible tube that are selectively restricted to change the rate of flow into a brew basket but adjustment is achieved only through manual adjustment of a control knob and the use of plastic tubing may be unsuitable for use with food and hot water. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a brewer and method of brewing that enable independent control of the batch quantities and the duration of the dispense time period during which hot water is dispensed into the brew basket without the need for intermittent operation of a dispense valve or the disadvantages of a variable speed pump or flexible tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the invention this control is achieved by provision of multiple dispense valves that are independently controllable. In one embodiment, more or fewer of the dispense valves are selectively actuated simultaneously during a single dispense time period to respectively increase or decrease the dispense flow rate during the dispense period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the dispense valves are of different size, and different rates are achieved during different dispense periods by selectively actuating only one of the valves during the single dispense time period. Actuation of a larger valve results in a greater flow rate and a larger batch size for a dispense period of given duration than actuation of a relatively smaller dispense valve for the same duration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment with a brewer of the type in which a fixed quantity of hot dispense water is &ldquo;dumped&rdquo;, i.e., is dispensed from the hot water tank by draining the tank to a preselected level without the tank being refilled until after the end of the dispense period, the plurality of dispense valves have inlets connected to the hot water tank at the plurality of different preselected levels and different sizes indirectly related to the level at which they are located to enable each dispense valve to &ldquo;dump&rdquo; the quantity of dispense water associated with the inlet level during dispense time periods of equal duration.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> functional block diagram of a coffee brewer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with one aspect of the invention is seen to include a number of elements that are common to the other embodiments as well as coffee brewers in general. These known elements include a hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that receives cold water from a public water supply <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through a bi-position solenoid controlled fill valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> controls the fill valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the other active elements of the brewer. The programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a computer with memory for receiving and storing user preselected parameters or other user programmable information or preselected and current brew parameters from a control panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and automatic inputs from a level sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides status and other information at a display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that in addition to an alphanumeric display may include various operating status lights. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also provides a control signal to operate the fill valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. When the level sensor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> indicates that the level of the water in the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is at a maximum preselected level, the solenoid controlled fill valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is deactuated to cause it to close, and when the water is detected at a minimum level beneath the preselected maximum level, the fill valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is opened. Thus, during a dispense period of a brew cycle, when water is being removed from the hot water tank, the level is maintained between the preselected maximum level and the preselected minimum level so that the head pressure at the valves remains relatively fixed during the dispense period. The fill valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> fills the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> much more rapidly than the dispense valves can empty it so that the preselected level is easily maintained even when the draining of hot water from the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is at the maximum rate. Because the level and thus the head pressure remain substantially the same throughout the dispense period, measurements of quantity may be easily be made by measuring the length of the dispense period. The quantity of hot water dispensed is directly proportional to the duration of the dispense period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Likewise, the programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> actuates a heater solenoid to apply electrical power to an electrical heater element, or heater, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to heat the water in the hot water tank when the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> indicates that the temperature is beneath a preselected minimum temperature. When the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> indicates that the temperature has risen above another preselected maximum temperature, then the programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> de-energizes the heater solenoid <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The temperature of the water is thereby maintained between the maximum and minimum preselected temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> For each brew cycle, a preselected amount of hot water is drained from the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during a preselected dispense time period, corresponding to a preselected quantity of coffee to be made and dispensed through a dispense assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> into a spray head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The spray head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> then sprays the hot water over a mound of dry ground coffee contained within a brew basket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The hot water passes through the ground coffee to extract the coffee beverage ingredients desired to make the freshly brewed coffee beverage that then passes from the brew basket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into a serving urn <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> All of these features of the brewer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, except for the multi-valve dispense assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the software in the controller for controlling multiple dispense valves, are conventional, and the details thereof form no part of the present invention. If desired, reference should be made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,082 entitled &ldquo;Beverage Maker and Method Of Making Beverage&rdquo; issued Mar. 19, 1991 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,331,885, entitled &ldquo;Semiautomatic Beverage Maker and Method&rdquo; issued Jul. 26, 1994 of the present inventor and the patents cited therein, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference for general background information and for further details with respect to the structural, mechanical and other details of the conventional components of coffee brewers and the like, with reference to the features noted above, and in general, with reference to the embodiment s described below to the extent conventional elements are disclosed in functional block form only and such details are desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In conventional brewers, the dispense assembly consists of a single bi-position valve per brewing station. In the case of a brewer such as brewer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the level of the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is maintained during the dispense period of the brew cycle, the bi-position valve is kept continuously open for a preselected time corresponding to a preselected quantity of hot water to be dispensed. The valve has only two positions: fully open and fully closed. When fully open, the flow rate is dictated by the water pressure at the level of the inlet to the bi-position valve. In the case of a fixed level system, such as the brewer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the level of the hot water in the hot water tank is kept fixed throughout the dispense period so that the flow rate remains constant throughout the dispense time period. In this fashion, the total quantity of water that is dispensed during a given dispense period is directly proportional to the duration of the dispense period that that the dispense valve is open. If it is desired to double the quantity, then it is necessary to double the dispense time period that the dispense valve is open. Likewise, if it is desired to increase the dispense period, then it is also necessary to increase the quantity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In my U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,717 referenced above, it is noted that both the time of contact of the hot water with the beverage ingredient and the amount of hot water that is mixed with a given amount of beverage are critical to optimizing the quality of the resulting brewed beverage. While independent control of batch quantity and dispense time period is achieved with the intermittent operation of a single valve as shown in my patent, such control has not been achievable with a bi-position dispense valve that is operated continuously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this independent control is achieved with a novel dispense assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The dispense assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has a plurality of solenoid controlled bi-position valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, preferably three, respectively labeled dispense valve A, dispense valve B and dispense valve C. In one form of the invention, all or at least a plurality of the bi-position dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are substantially identical with respect to the size of their valve openings, each of the valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> passing the hot water from the hot water tank at the same rate of flow for the same given pressure. In another form of the invention, all or at least a plurality of the dispense valves are of different sizes associated with different flow rates. The inlets of all the dispense valves are connected through a valve inlet manifold <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to a single preselected level at hot water tank dispense outlet <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, so they all experience substantially the same head pressure caused by the water in the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The outlets of all of the dispense valves are connected through a dispense valve outlet manifold <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to a shared, or common, dispense valve inlet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to the spray head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one mode of operation, preferably, although not necessarily, when all the dispense valves are of the same size, different batch quantities can be obtained without changing the length of the dispense period by selectively simultaneously opening different numbers of the valves. Presuming all the dispense valves are of the same size, and that one valve passes one half gallon of hot water in a dispense period of four minutes when fully open, the when two of the dispense valves are simultaneously opened for the entire dispense period, twice as much, or one entire gallon, will be dispensed during the four minute dispense period. Likewise, if it is desired to make a one and one half gallon batch of coffee, all three valves are opened for the entire dispense period of four minutes. Similarly, if it is desired to produce 0.75 gallon, then one of the dispense valves is kept open for the entire dispense period while another one of the bi-position valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is opened only during the second half of the dispense period. Other combination of valves and time periods during which they are fully and continuously opened may be selected for any other batch quantities, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the plurality of dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are selectively controlled to decrease the dispense time period without altering the batch quantity. For instance, if two of the solenoid dispense valves remaining open for four minutes yields a batch size of one gallon, then the dispense time period can be shortened to 2&frac23; minutes by opening all three of the dispense valves without changing the batch size of one gallon. Other like changes of dispense time periods may be made by opening other combinations of dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for preselected time periods to keep batch size the same while changing the dispense time period. Of course, it is also possible to selectively change both the dispense time period and the batch quantity In addition to obtaining the increase flexibility and control over batch size versus dispense time period, the brewer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also more robust than conventional brewers that have only a single dispense valve, for even if one of the plurality of dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> should become non-functional, the other dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can continue to be used to make batch quantities less than the maximum sized batch for a given dispense time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While the use of all dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the same size reduces the need for inventorying more than one type of replacement dispense valve and may simplify assembly and repair and simplify programming, it is also contemplated that at least two of the dispense valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are of different size. For instance one of the dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as valve A, may be twice as large as the other two dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as valves B and C, to achieve different batch ratios than when they are all the same. In the case of one dispense valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as valve A, being twice as large as the other two dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, opening one relatively small valve, such as valve B, would yield one half gallon; opening two small valves, such as valve B and C, or one large dispense valve, dispense valve A, for instance, would yield one gallon; opening one small valve C and the one larger valve A would yield one and one half gallons; and opening two small valve B and C and the one large valve A would yield two gallons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the three dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are three different sizes respectively associated with three different flow rates and three correspondingly different batch sizes, such as 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 gallons. In such case, only a singly one of the valves need be opened at a time to obtain the three noted batch sizes. However, by simultaneously opening a plurality of the different valves additional batch quantities (2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 gallons) can be achieved without changing the dispense time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the brewer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> be operated as a continuous fill system in which the level of the water in the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> be kept constant during the dispense period to maintain a uniform pressure and a resultant linear relationship between time and quantity and also to reduce or eliminate recovery time between brew cycles. This is the system described above. However, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with all of the valves connected at the same level of the dispense outlet <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> could also be used in a so-call &ldquo;dump system&rdquo;. In a dump system type maker the hot water tank is not refilled during the dispense period. Instead, the hot water tank is permitted to drain down to a preselected level associated with a preselected batch quantity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Disadvantageously, before a new brew cycle can commence the hot water tank must be refilled and the temperature brought up to the preselected minimum temperature. Nonetheless, the brewer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> could be used, or operated, as a &ldquo;dump system&rdquo;, and the invention contemplates such an embodiment. In such case, because the flow rate slows as the water level goes down and the relationship between time and quantity is not linear, care must be taken to determine the correct dispense time to batch quantity relationship. An empirical determination is recommended. If the tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is allowed to drain down to the level of the dispense outlet <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, then the quantity is fixed by the difference between the level to which the hot water tank is filled before the start of a brew cycle and the level of the dispense outlet <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. However, the time for dispensing this known quantity can be selectively changed by selectively opening one or more of the plurality of bi-position dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as discussed above, whether they are of the same size or of different sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> While the dispense valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> have been indicated as being only bi-positional valves, and that is the preferred embodiment, it should be appreciated that a multi-positional valve with different sized open positions, such as disclosed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and described below, could also be used for one or more of the plurality of the dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In such case, there would be multiple levels of control over the total dispense valve area&mdash;both the number of valves and the size, at least of some or one, of the valves could be selected to selectively vary dispense time period or the quantity, as the case may be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, another brewer constructed in accordance with the invention is shown in which the hot water tank has three different sized solenoid controlled valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; that are labeled dispense valve D, dispense valve E and dispense valve F. Unlike the solenoid valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the three solenoid valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; have individual valve inlets that connected to the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at three different locations, or levels, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, respectively associated with three different batch quantities, such as 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 gallons, respectively. An output manifold <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has a plurality of valve inlets that are connected to the valve outlets of the three dispenser valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, and an outlet <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that connects all the dispenser valve outlets of the dispenser valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; to the spray head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the brewer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is &ldquo;dump system&rdquo; type of brewer in which the fill valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not opened and the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not refilled until after the end of a dispense period. The batch size is determined by the difference in levels between the maximum level when the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is filled and the lowest level at which one of the dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; is opened until the water in the tank is drained to that level. In know brewers of this &ldquo;dump system&rdquo; type there is only a single dispense valve and thus only one batch size, or if it is known to provide multiple valves at different levels, they are the same size such that different batch sizes requires proportionately longer dispense time periods to drain the different quantities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the sizes of the dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; are indirectly proportional to the level at which their inlets are connected to the hot water tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For instance, if the dispense valve D is at the level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for dispensing 0.5 gallons, the dispense valve E is at the level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for dispensing 1.0 gallon and the dispense valve F is at the level <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for dispensing 1.5 gallons, then the dispense valve D may be one-third the size of the dispense valve E and one half the size of the dispense valve E, so that all of the different quantities may be dispensed during the approximately the same dispense period, when only one of the dispense valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; is opened at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is, of course, also be possible to increase the total dispense rate by opening a plurality of the dispense valves simultaneously. For instance, if a 1.5 gallon batch were to be made, the dispense time could be shortened from that provide by the opening of only dispense valve F, by also opening dispense valve E or both dispense valve D and E, in addition to opening dispense valve F. Once the level passes the inlet level of a particular dispense valve in question, then of course it can no longer contribute to the dispensing of the hot water, but so long as the water level is above the inlet level it can. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring now to a third form of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, instead of using a plurality of valves to achieve independent control of batch quantity and dispense time period, a single controllable size adjustable valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The size adjustable valve is has one inlet connected to the hot water tank and an outlet connected to the spray head <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The controllable size adjustable valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> changes in size are incremental and the valve is constructed and operates as described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the controllable size adjustable valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a valve opening plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that underlies and is slidably attached to a valve closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by suitable rails, guides or U-shaped clamps. The valve opening plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is mounted in a fixed position, and the valve closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is generally held in blocking, fully closed position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, by a suitable bias spring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. In the fully closed position, a valve opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in the valve opening plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is fully covered and blocked by the valve closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. One side of a fixedly mounted upstanding blocking pin <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> attached to the valve opening plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> blocks a laterally extending pin engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> carried by the closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> at the end adjacent the spring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to prevent the bias spring from causing the valve closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to over-travel in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The other side of the closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is connected through a mechanical linkage <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to a size adjustable valve solenoid <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that is selectively energized under control of the programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. When the solenoid is cause to become energized, overcomes the force of the bias spring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and pulls the closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in a direction opposite to arrow <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In the absence of any interference, each time the solenoid became energized it would pull the closure plate to a fully open position in which the entire valve opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is uncovered and unblocked, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is prevented from over-traveling in a direction opposite to that of arrow <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> by engagement of the engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with a fixedly mounted upstanding post <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> connected to the side of the valve opening plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, and again referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, there are two other solenoid controlled, movably mounted, intermediate stop pins <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> respectively connected to and controlled by stop actuator solenoids, or stop actuators, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is associated with the {fraction (1/3)} open stop actuator and when energized by the programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, moves to an upright position. In this upright position, the pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is in the path of the engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. If the pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is in an upright blocking position, when the valve closure plate is <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is pulled in a direction opposite to arrow <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> by the size adjustable valve solenoid <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, then the engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is blocked by the pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> from moving to the fully open position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and instead moves only to the {fraction (1/3)} open position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is at a longitudinal location to hold the lagging edge of the valve closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> at a position in which it blocks only {fraction (2/3)} of the valve opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Likewise, when the {fraction (2/3)} open stop actuator <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is energized, the pin <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> moves upwardly to a position to engage the engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to block the leading edge of the valve closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> from moving to a fully closed position. Instead, the leading edge is stopped at a <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> open position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In order to select the different sizes for the valve opening, it is of course preferable to follow a timing sequence in which the engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is at the fully closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, at the beginning of a brew cycle. Then, if it is desired to operate the controllable sized adjustable valve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at a {fraction (1/3)} open position, the {fraction (1/3)} open stop actuator <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is first actuated to place the blocking pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in the path of the engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> prior to energizing the size adjustable valve solenoid <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to start moving the closure plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> toward a filly closed position. If the size adjustable valve solenoid <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is energized too soon, then the pin <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will not be in a blocking position with respect to the engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the closure plate will not be blocked at the appropriate {fraction (2/3)} open position. Likewise, the {fraction (2/3)} open stop actuator must be actuated in time before passage of the engagement member in response to energizing of the size adjustable valve solenoid <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to block the engagement member <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with the pin <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> before it goes by on the way to a fully closed position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Preferably, the stop actuators <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are energized first before energizing of the size adjustable valve solenoid <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, although this may not necessarily technically be required so long as the appropriate pin comes up in time to block the engagement member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that this is only one form of size adjustable valve that would work successfully. For instance, instead of having a plurality of solenoid operated blocking pins, like pins <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, at fixed positions, the positions could be adjustable, such as by mounting the stop actuators on a track parallel to the side of the valve opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. While only two fixed-position actuators have been illustrated, many more stop actuators may be added at other fixed or movable or adjustable positions. Instead of having a choice between three positions, there could be ten positions or more or less. If a single stop actuator is mounted on a motor controlled track then the stop position can be place at any location within the resolution capability of a servomotor for moving the stop member to any position along the side of the valve opening at which the engagement member may be engaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Also, instead of a size adjustable valve like that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, employing stop members at different locations along a sliding valve closure, the valve could be a rotary adjustable valve adjusted manually or automatically, such as a size adjustable kitchen sink faucet or garden hose nozzle, or commercial equivalents, all driven by a servo-motor with position feedback to the controller for selecting the desired valve opening size, or flow rate, or dispense time, if not controlled manually. Alternatively, a circular diaphragm valve of the type having a plurality of members that move relative to one another to change the size of a generally circular valve opening. Any type of controllable valve that can be adjusted in size through the application of control signals from the programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be used. Importantly, the valve must be made of rigid metal elements that are nonabsorbent of the beverage ingredients and which can be thoroughly cleaned with solvents and hot water without damage to the valve. Preferably, the valve will also be designed reduce calcification or liming problems associated with hot water control systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is of course possible to combine any of the features of the invention to achieve other combinations and permutations, and now that the invention has been disclosed here, it should be obvious to those skilled in the art that such combinations may be made. For instance, analog adjustable valves, such as electromechanically controlled nozzles or faucets, in addition to servomotors for analog adjustment may also have a feed that is solenoid controlled on an on/off basis. The control of the valve size is preferably achieved in accordance with the different techniques illustrated and disclosed as alternatives above depending upon the type and number of size adjustable valves. There are many engineering tradeoffs that will occur to a person in the art of commercial coffee maker design that are not disclosed here as to which approach they may feel is best for a particular coffee maker project. Likewise, it should be appreciated that while only three valves are shown in the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, either only two valves could be used if less selections were desired or more than three solenoid controlled valves could be used if a greater number of selections was desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The precise control program of the programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or the type of computer used or the other details of the programmable controller form no part of the invention and depend upon indeterminate factors such as cost and capability that is desired. Generally however the programs works in accordance with the flow chart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. After start <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the brew parameter selection program, in step <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> the available batch sizes are displayed on the display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and the user is prompted to select one of the sizes. If in step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, it is determined that a batch size has been selected, the programmable controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> causes the display <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to show the user the available dispense times that may be available for selection based upon the batch quantity selection made in step <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Depending upon batch size certain dispense times may or may not be available. In step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, if the dispense time has been selected the program proceeds to step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in which the computer looks up in a table or otherwise determines based upon the batch size and dispense time period selected, which one or ones of the dispense valves should be opened and for how long they should be opened and when they should be opened within the dispense period in the case of the multi-valve embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. In the case of the single size adjustable dispense valve of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, or if used as one of the valves in the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the computer determines the degree or size to which the size adjustable valve or valves should be opened and for how long of a time period they should remain open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The programmable controller then awaits the start of a brew cycle, and in step <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> when it is detected that the start brew switch at the control panel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been actuated to start a new brew cycle, in step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> the programmable controller operates the dispense valve or valves <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or any combination of them being used together, in accordance with the preselection, or determination, in step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of which dispense valves are opened, the size to which each of the size adjustable valves should be adjusted, for how long the selected dispense valves remain open and when during the dispense period should the selected dispense valves be opened. At the end of the brew cycle, the program returns to start <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> While specific embodiments has been disclosed in detail here, it should be appreciated that many variations may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For instance, while the embodiments have been disclosed as operating the dispense valves continuously once they are opened, it is contemplated that one or more of the dispense valves may be operated incrementally, being repetitively opened and closed throughout the dispense time period, such as is taught in my aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,717. Also, one or more of the valves may be opened and then closed at the start of the dispense period to provide a wetting period. Moreover, while the invention has been described with reference to a coffee brewer, it is equally applicable to a tea brewer or any other similar beverage brewer in which water must be passed through an ingredient on a controlled basis of time and quantity to achieve optimum extraction from the ingredient and to optimize the quality of the beverage being brewed. </paragraph>
