<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus (MR apparatus) which is provided with an open magnet system. Magnet systems of this kind are essentially C-shaped and comprise an upper section and a lower section which both extend in the horizontal direction and are interconnected by way of a vertical column. An object to be examined (a patient) is arranged between the horizontal sections. Because the object to be examined is readily accessible from all sides, such systems are referred to as open magnet systems (as opposed to systems having a tubular examination zone); one or more further vertical columns may also be provided, for example, in order to enhance the mechanical stability of the magnet system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Pole plates for generating a basic magnetic field (B<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>-field) as well as gradient magnetic fields are provided on the horizontal sections of such magnet systems. The basic magnetic field extends through the patient essentially in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the patient (that is, generally in the vertical direction). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Flat, or at least flattish, RF conductor structures (flat resonators) in the form of RF transmitter coils or RF receiver coils are used to generate an RF field (B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-field) as well as to detect MR relaxation processes, said coils being provided on the pole plates. Furthermore, RF receiving coils can also be arranged around a region to be examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The MR frequency is dependent on the strength of the basic magnetic field. For the field strength of approximately 0.2 Tesla as customarily used nowadays, an MR frequency of approximately 8.2 MHz is obtained. In order to enhance the image quality, the aim is generally to increase this field strength to a range of up to approximately 1 Tesla; this value would give rise to an MR frequency of approximately 42.3 MHz. However, such a frequency would give rise to numerous problems during operation of an MR imaging apparatus of the known kind. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A first problem is due to the fact that the magnet system itself constitutes an electrical resonator, because the C shape has the effect of a folded dipole. The self-resonant frequency of a superconducting C-shaped magnet system is in the range of from 40 to 50 MHz in the case of customary dimensions of an MR apparatus which is intended for the examination of humans, so that it is of the same order of magnitude as the MR frequency at a field strength of the basic magnetic field which amounts to 1 Tesla (42.3 MHz). Consequently, electromagnetic energy can move from a corresponding RF transmitter coil into the magnet system and excite resonances therein which may give rise to strong electrical and magnetic fields on the enclosure of the magnet, and notably on the free ends of the C shape (so-called hot spots). Furthermore, the RF receiving coils could become coupled to the magnet system, so that the signal-to-noise ratio deteriorates and imaging is affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An additional problem consists in that, generally speaking, the RF transmitter coils are arranged directly on the pole plates where a current maximum of the dipole structure formed by the magnet system occurs, so that the RF transmitter coils are particularly sensitive to the resonant dipole structure and hence a comparatively strong coupling occurs and also strong influencing of the RF transmitter coils. Consequently, quadrature coil systems present in the magnet system may thus even be prevented from generating a circularly polarized RF field, because the coupling to the dipole field eliminates the orthogonality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further problem consists in that, as opposed to imaging apparatus provided with a tubular examination space, the RF conductor structures in open MR systems radiate electromagnetic energy essentially freely to the surrounding space. The space in which an MR imaging apparatus is installed, therefore, must always be shielded so as to prevent the electromagnetic radiation from interfering with the surroundings. Such a space (RF cage), however, at the same time constitutes a cavity resonator which is capable of absorbing energy. The fundamental mode of such a space, typically having the dimensions of 5 by 5 by 3 meters, amounts to approximately 42 MHz, so that space resonance can be excited and couplings between the RF structures and the space, being tuned to the (essentially the same) RF frequency, are unavoidable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, increasing the field strength of the basic magnetic field would give rise to numerous problems in the known MR imaging apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide an MR imaging apparatus of the kind set forth which can operate with significantly higher field strengths (that is, field strengths of up to 1 Tesla or more) of the basic magnetic field, that is, essentially without interference and with a higher image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> This object is achieved by means of a magnetic resonance imaging system which is provided with an open magnet system as disclosed in claim <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and is characterized in that coupling effects between a dipole structure formed by the magnet system and an RF conductor structure tuned to an MR frequency are eliminated at least to a high degree by shifting or detuning a self-resonant frequency of the dipole structure relative to the MR frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In conformity with a further solution as disclosed in claim <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such coupling effects are eliminated at least to a high degree by suppression of a self-resonant frequency of the dipole structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> If necessary, the above two steps can also be combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The dependent claims relate to further advantageous elaborations of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The claims <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> disclose advantageous types of shifting or detuning of the self-resonant frequency of the dipole structure by changing the electrical length thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The claims <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relate to the suppression of the self-resonant frequency of the dipole structure by way of a standing wave barrier or impedance trap and its advantageous embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In order to optimize its effect in respect of avoiding couplings between the magnet system and the RF conductor structure, the impedance trap is preferably tuned to the MR frequency in conformity with claim <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The embodiments disclosed in the claims <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are advantageous in particular when the geometrical length of the impedance trap deviates from the electrical length actually required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The embodiment disclosed in claim <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> prevents emitted electromagnetic radiation from interfering with the surroundings of an RF cage and also prevents the formation of standing waves within the RF cage.</paragraph>

</brief-description-of-drawings>
<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a room with four walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a floor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a ceiling <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. For the reasons already set forth, the room is shielded on all sides and hence constitutes an RF cage so that the electromagnetic energy generated inside the room cannot cause interference outside the room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the room there is installed an MR imaging apparatus which is represented only by the magnet system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The magnet system is shaped as a letter C which comprises an upper horizontal section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a lower horizontal section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as well as a vertical column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which interconnects said sections. The upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, wherebetween the examination zone for a patient is situated, accommodates in a customary fashion magnets for generating a vertical basic magnetic field of a field strength of up to approximately 1 Tesla as well as for generating gradient magnetic fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> At its free end which is remote from the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is RF coupled, via an essentially capacitive impedance <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, to the shielding of the ceiling <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the room, whereas the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rests on the floor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the room. The lower section need not necessarily be insulated relative to the floor, because the magnet system is in any case connected to ground potential via various connections such as, for example, supply leads for the gradient coils etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As has already been explained, the C-shaped magnet system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has the electrical properties of a folded dipole structure. Because of the connection of the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the RF cage, the dipole is electrically extended so that its resonant frequency is reduced accordingly and is spaced apart from the MR frequency which amounts to approximately 42.3 MHz in the case of a strength of the basic magnetic field of approximately 1 Tesla. Consequently, coupling effects between the magnet system and the RF conductor structures are reduced or eliminated at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If necessary, a short-circuit connection may be chosen for the connection instead of the capacitive impedance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the magnet system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also provided with a standing wave barrier (or impedance trap or bezooka balun) <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in the form of an additional, electrically conductive shield which is arranged around the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as a sheath and has an electrical length of &lgr;/4 (the effective electrical length can be adapted to a deviating geometrical length by means of capacitors and/or dielectric materials. A vertical end of the shield is then short-circuited to the inner magnet structure whereas the other end is open. Consequently, the impedance trap acts as an open &lgr;/4 lead and hence constitutes a high-ohmic barrier for RF currents of the wavelength &lgr;, so that the electrical resonance of the dipole structure is suppressed at the wavelength &lgr; which is preferably the MR frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Depending on the strength of the basic magnetic field as well as the resultant degree of convergence of the MR frequency and the self-resonant frequency of the dipole structure, imposed by the dimensions of the magnet system, one or both of the above two steps can be chosen so as to achieve adequate decoupling between the RF conductor structures and the magnet system. Moreover, the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the magnet system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can also be capacitively coupled to the shielding provided in the floor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, resulting in a further increase of the length of the dipole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a side elevation of the first embodiment. Parts which correspond to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are denoted by the same reference numerals. The magnet system rests on feet <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, that is, preferably in an electrically insulated manner, and comprises the horizontal upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the horizontal lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which links said sections. The impedance trap <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is shown in a cut-away view and its lower end is connected to the magnet structure of the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> whereas its upper end is open. The free end of the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is coupled, via the essentially capacitive impedance <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (or a short-circuit connection), to the shielding of the ceiling <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the room. Also shown are the RF conductor structures which are in this case formed by a first RF transmitter coil <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> below the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, by a second RF transmitter coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> above the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as well as by an RF receiver coil <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is arranged around a patient P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When the first RF coil <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the second RF coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are connected to one another by way of a common supply cable, these elements may constitute a second dipole structure in which a further dipole resonance is built up. In order to suppress this resonance, the common supply cable is also enclosed by way of an impedance trap. Alternatively, the supply cable can be conducted through the impedance trap <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> which encloses the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so that it prevents the occurrence of resonance of the magnet structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as well as of the RF transmitter coils <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a second embodiment of the invention in which the ends of the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and of the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the magnet system which are free in the FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are supported by a second column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Because the accessibility of the patient P is hardly affected when such a step is taken, this system and other systems with three or four columns are still referred to as open systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The second column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is also enclosed by an impedance trap <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> (shown in a cut-away view) which has a length of &lgr;/4; one end of said trap is short-circuited to the magnet structure whereas its other end is open, resulting once more in a &lgr;/4 lead which constitutes a high-ohmic barrier for RF currents and hence suppresses electrical resonances of the magnet system at the wavelength &lgr; (MR frequency). Moreover, parts which correspond to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are again denoted by the same reference numerals, so that it is not necessary to repeat the foregoing description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a detailed representation of a part of the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) with the impedance trap <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>) in a cross-sectional view. The impedance trap is formed by an essentially sleeve-like, electrically conductive shield <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (sleeve) which encloses the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a coaxial fashion, so that an intermediate space of a width of from approximately 1 to 2 cm exists between the column and the shield. The lower end <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> of the shield is electrically connected to the magnet structure of the column. The upper end <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the shield <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is free or is coupled to the magnet structure via a plurality of preferably adjustable capacitors <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a dielectric <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> (for example, a ceramic material) is provided in the intermediate space between the shield <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The dielectric as well as the capacitors serve to adjust the effective electrical length of the impedance trap in such a manner that there is formed a &lgr;/4 lead which is tuned to the MR frequency. Suppression of resonances in the range of the MR frequency with approximately from 10 to 30 dB can thus be achieved, and hence also a corresponding decoupling between the magnet system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the RF conductor structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The shield <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> encloses the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in a coaxial fashion, like a sleeve, and has essentially the same cross-sectional shape as said column. The shield and the column can thus have a circular, rectangular or other cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment in accordance with the invention in which the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the magnet system is electrically connected to the shielding provided in the floor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the room. In this case the building up of so-called ground plane resonances must be prevented, because one end of the dipole is connected to ground potential. For this purpose the magnet system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is proportioned in such a manner that between the base point F of the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the point A of the coupling of an impedance <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime; to the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> there is formed a conductor length of n*&lgr;/4. This conductor length ensures, in co-operation with the capacitive impedance <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime; which is connected in series and connected to the shield in the ceiling <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a shift of the resonant frequency of the dipole out of the range of the MR frequency, so that coupling effects between the RF conductor structures and the magnet system are at least reduced. For the purpose of tuning the capacitive impedance <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime; is preferably adjustable again. If necessary, it is also possible to dispense with the impedance and to couple the point A directly to the shielding in the ceiling <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (short-circuit connection). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Should this configuration not be suitable to achieve adequate decoupling, the steps described with reference to the FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Finally, a further possibility for shifting the dipole self-resonance of the magnet system consists in connecting the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to one another via a preferably adjustable capacitance (not shown). This is advantageous notably for the second embodiment which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> when this capacitance is included in the second column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the magnet system is present in the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as well as in the first column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> This step can also be combined with one or more of the steps described with reference to the FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a diagrammatic plan view of a fourth embodiment of the invention. This Figure shows the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as well as the first column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the second column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the magnet system. The upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is provided with a first conductor loop <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a second conductor loop <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> which enclose the section each time like a semi-circle along its circumference and are inductively coupled to the part of the magnet system which is present in the upper section. Similarly, a third conductor loop and a fourth conductor loop (not shown) are arranged in a semi-circle around the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to be inductively coupled to the part of the magnet system which is present therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The electrical equivalent diagram of this configuration is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) in which the associated components are denoted by their reference numerals. The first conductor loop <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the second conductor loop <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> form a first resonant circuit whereas the third conductor loop <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the fourth conductor loop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> of the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> form a second resonant circuit. The magnet system with the upper section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the column <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, constituting a third resonant circuit, is situated between said two resonant circuits. The three resonant circuits are inductively coupled to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The operation of this configuration is based on the fact that the coupling shifts the resonant frequency of the overall system, formed by the three resonant circuits, relative to the resonant frequency of the dipole structure, formed by the magnet system, in such a manner that an adequate distance from the MR frequency is obtained and hence coupling between the RF conductor structures and the magnet system is avoided. A coupling by way of capacitive elements could also be realized as an alternative for the inductive conductor loops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If necessary, this embodiment can again be supplemented with individual or several of the features described in relation to the FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In addition to avoiding a coupling between the RF conductor structures and the magnet system, it must also be ensured that no standing waves are excited in the room in which the MR imaging apparatus is installed and which is constructed as an RF cage for the previously described reasons, because such waves could be coupled to the RF transmitter coil and hence give rise to interference. This is because a value of approximately 42 MHz, that is, a value in the range of MR frequency, is obtained for the typical room dimensions of approximately 5 by 5 by 3 meters, that is, when the basic magnetic field has a strength of approximately 1 Tesla. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this respect a further problem is encountered in that the radiation in the RF cage can be influenced and varied by the other objects present in the cage, and also by the persons who are working therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid such problems, the magnet system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or the overall MR imaging apparatus, operates in an RF cage as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a plan view of the RF cage with side walls <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a floor <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as well as a ceiling (not shown) which closes the cage at the top. All walls, the floor and the ceiling are provided on the inner side with a layer of RF absorber material <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. It has been found that foam impregnated with a carbon suspension is a suitable absorber material which essentially absorbs the radiated electromagnetic energy. Moreover, movable partitions (not shown) provided with such an absorber material can also be arranged in the RF cage; such partitions can be displaced at will within the cage. Using such an RF cage, which may have said room dimensions of 5 by 5 by 3 meters, standing waves can be avoided to a high degree. </paragraph>
