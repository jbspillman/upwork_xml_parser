<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a device and a method for multiplexing and/or demultiplexing optical signals of a plurality of wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In optical telecommunications technology, in order to transmit the greatest possible quantity of data via an optical waveguide, it is known to multiplex the data to be transmitted. One possibility is to transmit information via an optical waveguide independently and simultaneously with a plurality of wavelengths. In this case, it is necessary to combine the signals from the various light sources into one optical waveguide using an optical multiplexer on the transmitting side. On the receiver side, it is also necessary to use an optical demultiplexer to divide the signals of the various wavelengths from the incoming optical waveguide into individual channels for separate detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In order to implement multiplexing or demultiplexing, Published European Patent Application EP-A-0 877 264 discloses the practice of separating the individual wavelengths using interference filters. By using a large number of interference layers, the interference filters produce very steep spectral edges between the transmission and reflection of different wavelengths. In this case, only a specific wavelength is let through by the interference filters, while the other wavelengths are reflected. By cascading such filters with individually different spectral transmission layers, selection or combination of a multiplicity of wavelength channels can be carried out. Using interference filters is extremely effective, in particular when there are relatively large wavelength intervals of 10 nm or more between the individual channels. Cascading a plurality of different filters can be carried out in a parallel optical beam path. A precondition for this is to use lenses or mirrors to form the beam. For the case in which the light is routed in optical waveguides, arrangements are known in which the light from one optical waveguide is reflected at an angle at a reflecting surface, and after the reflection, is routed onward in a further optical waveguide, the mirror being designed to be wavelength-selective. In this case, cascading is carried out by routing the optical waveguides in a zig-zag between a plurality of wavelength-selective mirrors. The drawback is that when filters are used in a cascade of filters, they must be very precisely designed and matched to one another. This is complicated and entails high costs. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet an additional feature of the invention, there is provided, a multiplexing element having a surface on which the wavelength-selective filter is configured. The multiplexing element has at least one further surface forming a plurality of reflecting surfaces that are configured obliquely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another feature of the invention, there is provided, an optical waveguide that is repeatedly led up to the wavelength-selective filter at different angles. The optical waveguide routs the light that includes the plurality of the wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet a further feature of the invention, there is provided, at least one reflecting surface. The optical waveguide is routed to and fro between the wavelength-selective filter and the at least one reflecting surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an added feature of the invention, the optical waveguide is formed in an optically integrated manner in asubstrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, the substrate is an integrated optical chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another feature of the invention, the substrate has a metallized surface that forms at least one reflecting surface; and the optical waveguide is routed to and fro between the wavelength-selective filter and the at least one reflecting surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the optical waveguide runs in a curved manner in the substrate such that the optical waveguide is repeatedly led up to the wavelength-selective filter at the different angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further added feature of the invention, at least one layer runs at an angle with respect to the wavelength-selective filter. The optical waveguide runs to and fro in a zigzag manner in the substrate such that the optical waveguide is repeatedly led up to the wavelength-selective filter at the different angles. Light is routed in the optical waveguide and is repeatedly reflected at the at least one layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further additional feature of the invention, the layer that runs at an angle with respect to the wavelength-selective filter is formed on the surface of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet an added feature of the invention, light that includes the plurality of the wavelengths is coupled into the optical waveguide directly from the edge of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet an additional feature of the invention, there is provided, a plurality of optoelectronic converters that are directly coupled to the substrate without using additional optics. Each one of the plurality of the optoelectronic converters detects coupled-out light of a respective separated one of the plurality of the wavelenghths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another feature of the invention, there is provided, a separate carrier element, and the wavelength-selective filter is formed on the separate carrier element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing and other objects in view there is also provided, in accordance with the invention, a method for operating on a plurality of wavelengths having optical signals. The method includes performing an operation that either multiplexes the plurality of the wavelengths having the optical signals by combining the optical signals in a wavelength-selective manner, or demultiplexes the plurality of the wavelengths having the optical signals by separating the optical signals in a wavelength-selective manner. The operation is performed by repeatedly deflecting the optical signals at respectively different angles onto a wavelength-selective filter such that at each one of the angles, only the optical signals of one specific wavelength are either coupled-in or coupled-out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an added mode of the invention, the light of the plurality of wavelengths is reflected to and fro between the wavelength-selective filter and at least one reflecting surface such that after each reflection, the light strikes the wavelength-selective filter at a different angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The invention enables the individual wavelengths of the optical signals to be combined or separated using only one wavelength-selective filter. The optical signals are routed in such a way that they repeatedly strike the wavelength-selective filter at respectively different angles. The optical signals of only one specific wavelength is coupled in or out for each angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The invention is therefore, based on the idea of performing the separation of the wavelengths not by using a plurality of different filters, but using a single filter that is illuminated or trans-illuminated at different angles. In this case, the wavelength-selective filter has a different filter characteristic for each irradiation angle: a specific angle corresponds to a specific wavelength that is separated by the wavelength-selective filter so that the wavelength ranges of the individual optical channels can be defined by the selection of the angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The invention has the great advantage that only one filter is needed for all of the optical channels or wavelengths. This is associated with a considerable savings in cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a preferred refinement of the invention, the light of the plurality of wavelengths is reflected to and fro between the wavelength-selective filter and at least one reflecting surface of the device in such a way that, after each reflection, the light beams strike the filter at a different angle. A specific wavelength is coupled out for each angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> At the same time, provision can be made both for only one wavelength to be let through by the wavelength-selective filter and for only one specific wavelength to be reflected by the wavelength-selective filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is pointed out that, in precise terms, it is not just one specific wavelength that is coupled out for a specific angle, but a narrow-band wavelength range with a bandwidth of, for example, 5 to 10 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous development of the invention, a plurality of reflecting surfaces, which are arranged at an angle with respect to the filter, are provided in the device. Here, dependent on the desired angle at which the light is intended to strike the wavelength-selective filter, the individual surfaces can be inclined at the same or at a different angle with respect to the wavelength-selective filter. The reflecting surfaces can also be located, in each case, at a different distance from the wavelength-selective filter. This permits the distance between the points of incidence of the light on the filter to be set in a desired manner, in particular equidistantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, the light of a plurality of wavelengths that are routed in an optical waveguide emerges from the optical waveguide. This light streams freely through an optical imaging system, in particular a lens, and is formed into a substantially parallel bundle of light that streams through the filter repeatedly, in each case at a different angle. The light beams of a specific wavelength are coupled out and are imaged, via a further optical imaging system, onto an optoelectronic converter, in particular a detector. The optical imaging systems are preferably integrated into a multichannel interface element, which constitutes a unit that is compact and simple to handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the wavelength-selective filter is, for example, imaged on the surface of a monolithic multiplexing element. The reflecting surfaces are formed on an opposite surface of the multiplexing element, running at an angle to the filter. This provides a compact arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the wavelength-selective filter is not arranged directly on the surface of a multiplexing element, but on a separate carrier element, for example a glass substrate, which is then connected to the multiplexing element. This has the advantage that the wavelength-selective filter can be produced separately and pre-tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In an alternate refinement of the invention, the light of a plurality of wavelengths is routed in an optical waveguide, which is led repeatedly up to the wavelength-selective filter at different angles. In this case, the light is reflected in a wavelength-selective manner at the wavelength-selective filter, and is routed onward in the optical waveguide. By an appropriately curved routing of the optical waveguide and/or a reflection at a reflecting surface, the light in the optical waveguide is again led up to the wavelength-selective filter, this time at a different angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this case, the optical waveguide is preferably formed in an optically integrated manner in a substrate, in particular an optically integrated chip. One or more reflecting surfaces can preferably be provided by a mirrored surface of the substrate. The optical waveguide can run in a curved manner or in a zigzag in the substrate. The light is preferably coupled into the optical waveguide directly at the substrate edge, without using additional optics. Likewise, the light separated into individual wavelengths is preferably selected using optoelectronic converters, which are coupled to the substrate directly and without using additional optics. However, it is also possible to arrange the optoelectronic converters in a carrier, which is then mounted at the edge of the substrate. A separate interface element can also be provided to couple light in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in Device and Method for multiplexing and/or demultiplexing Optical Signals of a Plurality of Wavelengths, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereof, there is shown a glass fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that routes the light of a multiplicity of wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Each wavelength provides an optical data channel for the transmission of data. The individual wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are separated using a demultiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that they can be detected separately. Given converse beam routing, the demultiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can also be used as a multiplexer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The demultiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a first optical imaging system <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a plurality of second optical imaging systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of reflecting surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>running at an angle with respect to the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The first optical imaging system <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated is a convex lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, forms the light beams of the plurality of wavelengths emerging from the glass fiber <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> into a virtually parallel bundle of light that falls on the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at a first angle a. The interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> includes a multiplicity of layers of different refractive index that are each &lgr;/<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and &lgr;/<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> thick. For example, the layers alternately consist of SO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or of ZrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and MgF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Such interference filters are known per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The parallel light bundle falls on the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at an angle &agr;, at which precisely one wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is let through by the interference filter, while the other wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are reflected. In the process, the light of wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes through the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> substantially without deflection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The angle &agr; at which the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is coupled out in this case depends on the interference filter used, on the wavelength coupled out, and on the desired bandwidth of the filter at the wavelength considered. In this case, the highest wavelength that can be separated by the filter is coupled out at the smallest angle of incidence (0&deg; ), and smaller wavelengths are coupled out at an increasingly greater angle (Also see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The light of the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is let through by the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be imaged onto a detector (not illustrated) by the second optical imaging system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which may be a lens, or can alternatively be coupled into an optical waveguide. In this case, as distinct from the illustration in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the lens <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be made to deflect the transmitted light in a suitable way, and in so doing, image it onto a detector or couple it into an optical waveguide. </paragraph>

The reflecting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is arranged at an angle to the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This leads to the light that is reflected at the reflecting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>then falling on the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at a different angle &bgr;. For the different angle of incidence &bgr;, the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has a different wavelength selectivity, so that now the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is coupled out and imaged onto a detector (not illustrated) via a lens <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The reflected light of the wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is in turn reflected at an obliquely arranged reflecting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and is routed to the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at a third angle &ggr;. Here, the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is then coupled out. The remaining wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is reflected at a reflecting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the multiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, again arranged at an angle, and then falls perpendicularly onto the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, which at this angle, is transparent to the wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that still remains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Of course, the same principle can also be used for separating a different number of wavelengths. In the manner described, by using only one filter, the wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are separated. Each wavelength that is separated strikes the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at a different angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The demultiplexer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> preferably consists of a monolithic multiplexing element having one surface with the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed thereon and having an opposite surface with the reflecting surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>arranged at angles and formed as steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The second optical imaging systems or lenses <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are preferably integrated into an interface element <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that is placed onto the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For more simply producing the multiplexing element, it may also include two subareas <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can then be fitted to one subarea <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the obliquely arranged reflecting surfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the first optical imaging system <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be formed on the other subarea <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The subarea <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the interference filter in this case provides a separate carrier element for the interference filter. The two sub-elements <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are placed directly one on the other along a parallel interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a plan view of an alternate exemplary embodiment of a demultiplexer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, in which the light of a plurality of wavelengths &lgr;l, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is routed in an optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In this case, the optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is formed in an optically integrated manner in a substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. An interference filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is arranged at the upper edge <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (at right angles to the plane of the drawing). The interference filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is formed on a carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> that is fixed to the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The lower substrate edge <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is metallized, so that it acts as a mirror. Alternatively, the interference filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> can also be formed at the substrate edge <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> without using a carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Light of the various wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is coupled directly into the optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at the substrate edge. In the optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the light is routed to the wavelength-selective filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> at a first angle &agr;. As explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is coupled out, while the further wavelengths are reflected. In the optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, these reflected further wavelengths are routed away from the filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> at an angle toward the lower, silvered substrate edge <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, are then reflected there, and are then routed onto the interference filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> at a second angle &bgr; by the curved optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The wavelength &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then coupled out. Following further reflections at the metallized substrate edge <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the light is deflected into the optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> at an angle &ggr; and finally deflected onto the interference filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> perpendicularly such that the wavelengths &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that still remain are coupled out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The respective wavelengths that are coupled out are in turn detected by an optoelectronic converter, in particular a photodiode <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated only schematically. The photodiodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are coupled onto the integrated optical chip <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or the carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> directly, and without using additional optics. Alternatively, a carrier element is provided for the photodiodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the carrier is connected to the carrier <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, just like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, relates to a four-channel demultiplexer, in which the light is routed in an optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime;. Differing from that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; in this case runs in a zig-zag, and in straight lines on the respective subsections in the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime;. The functional mechanism when coupling the wavelengths &lgr;l, &lgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, &lgr;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and &lgr;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> out is the same as that described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Because of the zig-zag routing of the optical waveguide <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; in the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime;, however, it is not just one metallized reflecting surface that is provided, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but a plurality of metallized reflecting surfaces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; that are each arranged at an angle, that is to say not parallel, to the interference filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime;. For this purpose, the substrate <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; is provided with edges running appropriately at an angle, at which the reflecting surfaces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; are implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Optoelectronic converters for detecting the separated wavelengths are again coupled to the substrate or the integrated optical chip directly and without using additional optics, or alternatively, are provided in a carrier element for the converters. Likewise, the light can, in each case, be coupled into an optical waveguide, where each optical waveguide transmits a separated wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It is pointed out that, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the edges running obliquely and having the reflecting surfaces <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; are, in each case, arranged at a different distance from the interference filter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime;. This permits the distance between the points of incidence of the light on the interference filter to be set to a desired value, in particular equidistantly. Thus, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the distance between the first three points of incidence, and correspondingly also, the distance between the associated optical imaging systems <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and converters is equidistant. If, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the edge having the reflecting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&prime; would have a greater distance from the interference filter <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>&prime;, the last point of incidence would also be equidistant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Here, consideration must be given to the fact that the necessary angle of incidence is defined by the wavelength to be separated. Nevertheless, an equidistant arrangement of the imaging systems and converters can be provided by using a suitable setting of the distance between the individual edges or reflecting surfaces, which has the advantage of simpler provision of these systems and components in a carrier element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the angle-dependent transmission of a wavelength-selective filter. The transmission is shown both for p-polarization and for s-polarization of the light. It is easy to see that, for different angles at which the light falls on an interference filter, the interference filter is transmissive for different wavelengths. Given knowledge of the angle-dependent transmission, the light of the wavelength to be separated is directed onto the interference filter at the respectively requisite angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is pointed out that the angular dependence of the transmission of an interference filter is an inherent characteristic of an interference filter, and it requires no further measures to provide such an angular dependence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In terms of its embodiment, the invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiments illustrated above. For example, it is likewise possible for the interference filter to be designed such that only one specific wavelength is reflected and the other wavelengths are transmitted. If the transmitted wavelengths are reflected and routed back to the interference filter at a different angle, the result in this case is a function that is the same as that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The essential factor for the invention is merely that the optical signals are routed in the multiplexer/demultiplexer in such a way that they strike a wavelength-selective filter repeatedly at different angles, where a specific wavelength is coupled out for each angle. </paragraph>
