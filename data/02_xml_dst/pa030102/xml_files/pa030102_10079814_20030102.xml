<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and more specifically, is directed to an apparatus and method used to pre-amplify the differential input signal in the comparator stage of a high-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Applications such as high-end video signal processing, high performance digital communications, medical imaging, and the like, require analog-to-digital conversion with high sample rates and a large dynamic range. In response to these needs, there is a continued search for circuit architecture and techniques enabling an ADC to meet the specifications with reasonable chip size area and small power dissipation. It is of particular interest if such ADCs can be fabricated in standard CMOS technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Most published ADCs that come close to the mentioned specifications are bipolar implementations. Their high speed and wide dynamic range owes to the use of open-loop precise, building blocks, including low-offset comparators. CMOS ADCs, by contrast, tend to use closed loop amplifier circuits for precise analog signal processing and close-loop, auto-zeroed, comparators in quantizers that resolve 4 bits or more. It is therefore difficult for CMOS circuits to attain the dynamic range of a bipolar ADC built with devices of comparable frequency capabilities. Implemented using comparable frequency capabilities the bipolar transistors are much faster than the CMOS transistors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another problem the high-speed ADCs implemented in CMOS technologies involves finite matching of the components on the chip. Specially, if small transistor sizes are used, then the mismatch results in large offset voltages. Such offset voltages have a substantial effect on differential non-linearity and the integral non-linearity of the ADC. Furthermore, electronic elements implemented using CMOS technologies have a reduced supply voltage because of the large electric field occurring in the device channels. A small reference voltage is required for such a system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For example, a 0.18 micron (&mgr;m) device can handle 1.8 volts (V), while for a 0.12 &mgr;m device a 1.2V supply voltage is required. In a complex ADC of N bits, the number of quantization steps can be approximated by 2<highlight><superscript>N</superscript></highlight>. An N-bit ADC must use some form of multi-stage quantization with intermediate stages between each sub-quantize step to form and amplify the analog residue. With a reference voltage of 0.5 V, maximum quantization step size, has a value of 0.5/2<highlight><superscript>N</superscript></highlight>. Thus, a 10 bit converter (n&equals;10), has quantization step size of 0.5 mV. The offset voltage due to mismatch in submicron technologies is typically much larger that this minimum step size. An offset compensation technique is therefore required to obtain a practically operating system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The majority of the current high speed ADCs employ a 2.5 V supply voltage. Older versions of the high speed ADC employ higher voltage supply levels. For example, 3.8 V or 5V. The transition of the circuit towards lower values of the supply voltage is difficult to make. The reason for that is the direct proportionality that exist between the value of the supply voltage and the signal level. As the value of the supply voltage decreases the level of the signal decreases. As a consequence the level of noise associated with the signal decreases and the signal associated inaccuracies have to decrease. These factors impact the dynamic range of the ADC. In order to preserve the dynamic range of the ADC at its maximum level, it is desired to reduce the noise levels as much as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to meet the requirements imposed by technology, the levels of the power supply have to be conveniently chosen, as discussed in one of the previous paragraphs. If the level of the supply voltage is low the correspondent power dissipation is low. But, the reduction of the level of supply voltage not necessarily mens the reduction of the noise levels which are strongly related with the dynamic range. In order to keep the dynamic range high the noise levels have to be kept low. We distinguish two categories of noises: the thermal noise and the voltage offset associated noises. The thermal noises are associated with the presence of a random type behavior of the currents and the voltages in the circuit. In an ideal case the offset voltage in transistors are absent form the circuits. But the presence of random voltages causes deviation from the ideal behavior. The presence of deviation is indicated by noise. If the value of the supply voltage decreases the value of the offset voltage is also affected. The desired small offset levels and implicitly the wide dynamic range can not be achieved by reduction of the input power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other factors, such as the technology employed to implement the circuits and the nature of the transistors used, also come into play. In order to obtain a small offset voltage the transistors used have to have a larger gate area. This involves two disadvantages: the larger chip area required to implement such circuits, and the greater power supply level required to operate these transistors. Also, the speed of the circuits does not improve with the reduction of the power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, what are needed is a technique that achieves reduction of the offset voltage values, without focusing on adjusting the size of the gate area. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described more fully in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which the preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention should not, however, be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, they are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> represents a N-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for converting an analog input signal V<highlight><subscript>IN </subscript></highlight>to a digital output signal V<highlight><subscript>OUT</subscript></highlight>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The ADC circuit includes a reference voltage generator (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>), a pre-amplifier block (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), a comparator block (<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>), an encoding block (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>), a decoding block (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), and a clock signal line (<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The reference voltage generator (<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) outputs a plurality of differential reference voltage signals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. The plurality of differential reference voltage signals <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the analog input signal V<highlight><subscript>IN </subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>) constitute input for the pre-amplifier block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The pre-amplification block amplifies the difference between each of the plurality of differential reference voltage and the analog input signal and outputs a plurality of differential pre-amplified difference signal. The comparator block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> receives the plurality of differential pre-amplified signals and compares them with the zero crossing. Individual comparators, for example, within the comparator block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> output assign either a binary 1 or a binary 0 to each of the compared, pre-amplified signals. The resulting binary set <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is fed into the encoding block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> outputs an M-bit encoded signal <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. This M-bit encoded signal is fed into the decoding block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which outputs an N-bit digital output signal V<highlight><subscript>OUT</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The reference voltage generator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can comprise a resistive divider network. This resistive divider outputs a plurality of incrementally ascending reference voltage signals, as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art. The pre-amplifier block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of cascaded, differential, switched-capacitor circuits. The comparator block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> consists of a plurality of comparators, that can be implemented, for example, as amplifier circuits. Each comparator produces a 1 when its differential input signal is positive compared to the zero crossing. Otherwise the comparator assigns a 0. The digital weights and corresponding circuits can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The decoding block comprises a plurality of logic elements, such as gates or flip-flops. The decoder block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises a set of latches, that can be D flip flops, for example. The clock signal line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> allows a clock signal to be fed into the pre-amplifier block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, comparator block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and decoding block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, driving these blocks depending on a particular phase of the signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A drawback of comparators as opposed to amplifiers is that they inherently have a large offsets because of their dynamic nature. They must assign a binary 1 or a binary 0 in a limited, often very short period of time. Usually during a clock cycle. Large swing signals enter the circuit and, implicitly, the large offsets are formed at the output of the comparator block. These are dynamic offsets caused by large signals that are varying rapidly. The comparators by themselves will not have small offsets. This is the reason why the present invention employs pre-amplification. Pre-amplification usually takes as much as half a clock cycle, but the signal might not be pre-amplified sufficiently in. order to overcome the high offsets of the comparators during such a short time. For that purpose, the present invention includes the pre-amplification block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with a cascaded, pipe-lined, differential structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The pre-amplifying block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of cascaded, pipelined, differential, switched-capacitor circuits. A block representation of a single-ended switched capacitor circuit (<highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. The single-ended switched capacitor circuit comprises a differential voltage source means <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, multiple switches <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, a storage mean <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, transistors <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, single switch <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and, current source <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>. This is a general, illustrative embodiment of the present invention which does not meant to be limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The differential voltage source <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> outputs an analog input signal <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, and a portion of the plurality of differential reference voltage signals (<highlight><bold>1109</bold></highlight>) generated by the reference voltage generator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1109</bold></highlight> signals constitute inputs for a multiple switching means <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. The switching means <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> output a switched signal <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> that charges the storage means <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. The transistor means <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is biased with a current signal <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight> from the current source means <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The transistor means <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> performs an amplification function. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> the transistor means <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> have their source grounded. Part of the signal <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight> output by the current source means <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> serves to drive a single switching means <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>. The switch <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> can be closed to short-circuit the drain to the gate of the transistor means <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> by having the <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> line in an opened or closed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> is a detailed representation of the single ended switched-capacitor circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. The multiple switching means <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> is implemented using two switched capacitors <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight>. The two capacitors can be driven by a dual clock phase signal as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art. The two different phases of the clock signal are &phgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>and &phgr;<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>. They are two non-overlapping clock phases. The storage means <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> is implemented using a capacitor. The single switching means <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> is implemented using a switched capacitor. The switched capacitor <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> receives one phase of the clock signal and can be driven by a segment of the current signal <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>, output from the current source means <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Two modes of operation can be distinguished for <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> circuit: a track and hold mode and a compare/amplification mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference> illustrates the corresponding configuration of the <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> circuit for the track and hold mode of operation. During the track and hold mode operation, the switched capacitors <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> are closed. The &phgr;<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>component of the clock phase signal is high. The &phgr;<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>component of the clock phase signal is low. Implicitly, the <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight> switch capacitor is opened. This allows the analog input voltage signal <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> to charge capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. During this mode of operation the gate and the drain of the grounded transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> are shorted. As a result the transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> behaves like a diode. In this case the diode has low impedance. As a result, in the second lead <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight> of the capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> can sample the gate voltage of the grounded transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. The voltage value present at line <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> is called V<highlight><subscript>OFFSET</subscript></highlight>. At the end of this mode on one lead of the capacitor <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> sample the input voltage and second lead of the capacitor samples V<highlight><subscript>OFFSET </subscript></highlight>and the voltage of the gate of transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

During this mode of operation switches <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> are opened and switch <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight> is closed. As a result, the portion of the output reference signal transmitted through line <highlight><bold>1109</bold></highlight> can be sampled by the capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. The switch <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> is opened. As a result the gate and the drain of the grounded transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> are not short-circuited during phase &phgr;<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>of the clock signal. The transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> functions as an amplifier. The gate voltage of transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> undergoes a shift equal to the difference between V<highlight><subscript>IN </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>REF</subscript></highlight>. This voltage shift is independent of the value of V<highlight><subscript>OFFSET</subscript></highlight>. The offset voltage is still stored in the <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> capacitor. Also, the offset voltage of a transistor is constant in time. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The circuit comprises input terminals (left and right input terminals), switched capacitors <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight>, input capacitors <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, transistor means <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, common feedback capacitors (<highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2011</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2113</bold></highlight>), output swing limiting transistors (<highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>), output terminals (left and right output terminals). In an embodiment of the present invention, the capacitance of the feedback capacitors is equal. The aim of the differential implementation is to use the circuit as a differential amplifier. For this purpose, circuit bias is maintained at the bias point where the transistors <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> operate as amplifiers. This mode of operation for the amplifiers can be achieved by maintaining a certain predetermined level at the output terminals. The four additional capacitors keep both bias input currents from the 105.1 current source means at the desired level. Without these common feedback capacitors, the gain of the circuit during common mode operation and differential mode operation would be the same. In differential mode operation a high gain is desired. Without the common feedback capacitors the gain in common mode operation would be high also. This is an undesired state that is eliminated by the presence of the common feedback capacitors. The desired state of the circuit is to allow high differential gain and very low common mode gain. The function of the four common feedback capacitors is to keep the transistors <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> biased at the right point so that they can operate as amplifiers. </paragraph>

The additional elements are two transistors <highlight><bold>2114</bold></highlight>, which are biased from a grounded voltage source <highlight><bold>2115</bold></highlight>. The transistors <highlight><bold>2114</bold></highlight> are connected with the transistors <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> in such a way that transistors <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> will still be saturated. The gate of the cascaded transistor is biased in a manner that allows the drain voltage of transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> to be at a voltage level corresponding to saturation. The voltage at the gate of the cascaded transistor <highlight><bold>2114</bold></highlight> is slightly different that the level of saturation voltage for transistor <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>.

In an embodiment of the present invention the capacitance of the feedback capacitors are equal in value. The differential amplifiers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> function as operational amplifiers. At the input of the <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> circuit a purely differential signal is present. As represented in the figure, during one half of a period, the signal in the upper input node goes high, while the signal in the lower input node goes low. The two signals have no common portion at the input. At the output of the circuit a purely differential signal is present. If the signal present in the upper output goes high with a certain amount the signal present at the lower output goes low with the same amplitude amount. This behavior is allowed by the presence of the feedback capacitor circuit. More important, the two feedback capacitors <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2113</bold></highlight> allow feeding back of the signal at the input of the <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> amplifiers. Because the signal across them is identical in value but opposite in sign, their signals will cancel at the input of the <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> amplifier. The amplifiers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> drive the capacitors with their output despite of the cancellation of the differential signals. The capacitors accumulate a load for the amplifiers. </paragraph>

The figure illustrates either the upper or the lower portion of the circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The equivalent circuit comprises an input node, the input capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, the differential amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, a parasitic capacitor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, an equivalent parasitic capacitor <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, and an output node.

The <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> circuit comprises two differential amplifiers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, input capacitors <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, feedback capacitors <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2011</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2113</bold></highlight>, and output capacitors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the capacitance of the feedback capacitors are equal in value. The capacitance of the input capacitors <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> differs from the capacitance of the feedback capacitors. The differential amplifiers <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> function as operational amplifiers. At the input of the <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> circuit a common-mode input signal is present. As represented in the figure, during one half of a period, the signal in the upper input node goes high, while the signal in the lower input node goes high also. Or, the signal in the upper input node goes low, while the signal in the lower input node goes low. The two signals have common portion at the input. At the output of the circuit a purely common-mode signal is present. The arrangement of the feedback capacitors allows that capacitor <highlight><bold>2113</bold></highlight> feeds back from the output of the upper amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> into the upper input of the lower amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Also another feedback capacitor <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> feeds back from the output of the lower amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> into the upper input of the upper amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. The feedback capacitors <highlight><bold>2113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight> do not cancel each other&apos;s effect in common-mode, as they did in differential mode operation. As the amplitude of both output signals goes high, the output signal is the sum of the common-mode input signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A simplified representation of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is shown made in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. The circuit comprises an input node, an input capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, a differential amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, a parasitic capacitor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a feedback capacitor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, an output capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> and an output node. The simplified circuit has performs identically as circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. Capacitor <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is the parasitic capacitor of the differential operational amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Its capacitance value is the equivalent of the values of the feedback capacitors and the parasitic capacitance of differential amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. The presence of feedback capacitor <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> was not necessary to explain the simplified operation of circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in differential mode. In that case, the signals canceled each other at the input. In common-mode operation, a feedback is present, due to the fact that the input signals add up. In order to overcome the large offsets of the comparator block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the pre-amplification has to be made as large as possible. For this purpose several switched capacitor circuits are used. Their association is a cascaded, pipelined structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> illustrates a single-ended, cascaded, differential switched-capacitor circuit. This structure pipelines several circuits <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>, as they were represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. The first stage of the cascaded structure <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> comprises two input nodes, two switched capacitors <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight>, an input capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>, a switched capacitor <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, a current source <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>, and output node. The two switched capacitors <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight> and the switched capacitor <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> can be driven by a dual clock phase signal. The output node of the fist stage of the cascaded structure is coupled to the next stage. The first lead of an input capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> is connected into the output node of the fist stage. The second lead of the input capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight> is connected into a switched capacitor <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and into an amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> biased from a current source <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>. The output node of the second stage of the cascaded structure <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is connected in the same way as previously described with the first lead of a input capacitor <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> illustrates a three stage cascaded structure. But, it would be apparent to a person skilled in the art that this repetitive structure can have more or less than three stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> When one phase of the clock signal is high, (&phgr;<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>), the first amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> has its gate shortened to the drain, as an effect of the position, opened or closed, of switches <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>. If the other phase of the signal, (&phgr;<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>) is high, the position of the switches changes, as it was above explained. The result is that the difference between the corresponding portion of the reference signal and the analog signal is amplified. The amplified signal is stored on the input capacitor of the second stage <highlight><bold>1103</bold></highlight>. The amplification function continues in the subsequent stages, depending whether the position of switch <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> allows the amplifier <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> to perform an amplification function. The cascaded, pipe-lined circuit <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is implemented to achieve sufficient gain to overcome the offset. </paragraph>
