<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to latches and more particularly relates to latch assemblies utilizing handles and handle latching mechanisms for use with ceiling and air conditioning, ventilation and/or refrigeration units or cabinets and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Latch assemblies with handles are known which are lockable by utilization of an internal lock cylinder which prevent the handle from rotating. Typically these latch assemblies may be locked and unlocked and remain in the unlocked position whereby the handle and door attached thereto may be opened with one hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the past, the handles as known for use with ceiling and/or air conditioning or refrigeration cabinets have not provided a desired level of insulating qualities to prevent thermal transfer from occurring within a compartment. In addition, the handles as known did not provide sufficient insulating qualities to prevent condensation or frosting from occurring upon the handle and the associated temperature increases, air pressure and/or heat transfer from escaping from the interior of a compartment. In addition, no handle is known which provides a thermal break or barrier to insulate a handle used on a ceiling/air conditioning or refrigeration cabinet to provide a temperature and/or air seal for a ventilation and/or refrigerated structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A handle surface having a reduced temperature frequently occurs due to the use of non-insulating grooves, handle shaft air leakage and set screws for affixation of the handle to a door. The use of grooves and set screws frequently enable air to leak through the grooves which in turn causes an air leakage to occur on the handle which in turn causes a condensation to form upon the door handle. In addition, the use of grooves and set screws for affixation of a handle to a ventilation and/or air conditioning door frequently result in the loss of cool air from the interior of a air conditioned compartment into a heated environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There has been minimal development of efficient and convenient latching assemblies which solve these identified problems. Additional locking features to accommodate a padlock may also be desirable for use with a ceiling and/or air conditioning cabinet. Further, prior art latch assemblies, particularly locking latch assemblies normally lack flexibility in being adaptable for varying applications, for example, a left or right handed application with a door for a ventilation and/or refrigerated structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a latching assembly for a ceiling and/or air conditioning or refrigeration cabinet for establishment of an effective insulation thermal barrier to effectively thermally seal or insulate a compartment from the loss of air from within a structure. The thermal handle and latch includes a base having an index pin; a stop fixedly positioned in a circular working channel; an aperture traversing the base; a support stem positioned in the aperture for rotatably attaching the shaft to the base. The shaft includes a threaded end and an affixation end having a nut-shaped platform and arcuate positioning limiter. The positioning limiter is designed for rotational placement within the circular working channel and is further adapted to engage the stop. The nut-shaped platform further includes a centrally positioned threaded bore used to affix the handle to the shaft through the use of a threaded fastener. The handle includes a grasping end and head portion. The head portion includes a nut shaped receiving area and an arcuate protruding positioning member. The protruding positioning member is adapted for positioning and rotation within the circular working channel. The nut shaped receiving area preferably covers the nut shaped platform. The rotation of the handle causes the rotation of the nut shaped receiving area, and the arcuate protruding positioning member, which in turn cooperate to move the positioning limiter within the circular working channel towards or away from the stop during the latching or unlatching of a door to a structure. The central aperture further traverses the head portion of the handle and is adapted to receive the threaded fastener used to affix the shaft to a handle. A lock may also be included with the handle. The lock preferably is formed of a locking cylinder adapted to receive a key. The insertion of a key permits rotation of a locking cylinder to elevate one or more pins to permit the cylinder to be turned approximately 90&deg; relative to the handle. At the distal end of the cylinder is preferably an arm having a worm gear which is rotatably engaged to teeth as integral to a linearly sliding arcuate locking barrier. Rotation of the key 90&deg; clockwise causes the worm gear to rotate and to retract the linearly sliding arcuate locking barrier into a cavity and out of the circular working channel, thereby, permitting rotation of the handle, nut-shaped platform, arcuate positioning limiter, shaft and protruding positioning member for unlatching of the latch member as integral of the shaft from the keeper or latch receiver integral to the interior door frame during opening of a door for a refrigerated cabinet. An escutcheon is preferably affixed to the shaft between the interior of the door and the latch member to establish a thermal barrier preventing undesirable heat or cold transfer, frost and/or cooling loss through the handle, latch, and/or lock into an exterior environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The lock mechanism may include an arcuate locking or interference barrier which may slide linearly with respect to the shaft to prevent or permit rotation of the handle and shaft relative to the base. The locking or interference barrier may be operatively connected to the locking cylinder so that upon rotational movement of the key, the locking or interference barrier is brought into and out of engagement from the working channel in the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A principal object of the present invention is the provision of a ventilation and/or refrigeration handle and lock which is formed of relatively simply and inexpensive design, construction, and operation and which is safe and fulfills the intended purpose of providing a thermal barrier for a refrigerated compartment without risk of injury to persons and/or damage to property. </paragraph>
