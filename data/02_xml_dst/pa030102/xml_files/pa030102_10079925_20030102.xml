<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to semiconductor processing, and more particularly, to a method for manufacturing isolating structures in a substrate. The substrate is particularly, but not exclusively, silicon carbide, and reference will be made throughout this description to this field of application for convenience of illustration. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Silicon carbide is an extremely resistant material to chemical etching, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Removing a portion of silicon carbide by ordinary etching techniques as used in standard silicon-integrated circuit manufacturing processes is difficult. A method for etching away such layers is based on the use of a fluorine solution utilizing an especially dense plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> While being advantageous on several counts, this method has certain drawbacks. In particular, a hard mask layer must be used to define the areas to be removed. Defining the hard mask layer involves some serious resolution problems, and complicates the silicon carbide etching process. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing background, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing isolating structures in silicon carbide layers. This method is compatible with standard microelectronic device manufacturing techniques and is effective to overcome the limitations of the prior methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The principle on which this invention is based is one of &ldquo;damaging&rdquo; the areas of the silicon carbide layer to be removed by modifying the lattice structure of the silicon carbide layer using an ion implantation process, thereby making for faster and more efficient removal of such layers. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a first embodiment of a method for manufacturing insulating structures, according to the invention, will now be described. The process steps and the structures described below do not form a complete process flow for manufacturing integrated circuits. In fact, this invention can be practiced jointly with integrated circuit manufacturing techniques currently used in the art, and only those common process steps will be discussed herein as are necessary for understanding the invention. The drawing figures which show cross-sections through a semiconductor wafer are not drawn to scale. They are drawn to highlight major features of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A masking layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a photoresist or metal, e.g., silicon oxide, is formed over the surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of silicon carbide (SiC). Openings <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A are formed through the masking layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> using conventional photolithographic techniques, and successive etching steps are performed for exposing the substrate portions where the isolating regions (trenches) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A are to be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, an ion implanting step is carried out to implant the chip surface with heavy ions or a dopant throughout. Thus, in the implanted regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> uncovered by the masking layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the ion implanting step will result in the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becoming &ldquo;damaged&rdquo;, in the sense that its Si&mdash;C lattice structure undergoes alteration. Advantageously in the inventive method, the depth of the &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be varied by changing parameters, such as energy and dosage of the ions being implanted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> After removing the masking layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the whole substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to an oxidizing step. An oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed over the chip surface. As is known, during the heat treating process, a surface portion of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is also converted into the oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In particular, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a first portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with a first thickness in the regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, while on the rest of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the oxide layer has a second portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with a second thickness smaller than the first thickness. The difference is due to variations in the lattice structure of the implanted regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, generated during the ion implanting step. This causes the rate of oxidation of the silicon carbide layer to increase, and consequently, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to grow thicker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The process for thermally oxidizing the silicon carbide is extremely slow, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> illustrates. This figure shows a plot of the thickness of the oxide grown over SiC against time at different oxidation temperatures. Advantageously in this invention, the rate of oxidation increases substantially as ions are implanted in the SiC substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For example, when silicon ions are implanted at 1 MeV and at a concentration of 5*10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, with the oxidation process being conducted at 1150&deg; C. for two hours in an O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere, the thickness of the oxide layer in the regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is 2.5 &mgr;m, against an oxide layer that is 500 nm thick in the undamaged portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Under these conditions, the depth of the oxide layer in the substrate would be 1 &mgr;m when a conventional 1% fluorine technique is used. A step of removing the oxide layer from both the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> results in isolating regions (trenches) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A being defined depthwise in the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Advantageously in this invention, the isolating regions and their trenches are formed by etching through the layer of silicon oxide rather than the silicon carbide. Thus, standard removal operations, such as those provided in conventional integrated circuit manufacturing processes, can be carried out to form the trench regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The method of this invention is especially advantageous where isolating trenches are to be formed for an epitaxially grown diode. This will now be described as a second application of the inventive method with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the structure shown in these figures, identical elements with those of the structure previously illustrated are denoted by the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A first epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is doped with impurities of the N-type at a relatively low dopant concentration, and a second epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is doped with P-type impurities at a relatively high dopant concentration. These layers are formed over the surface of a silicon carbide substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the second layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is thinner than the first layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A masking layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a photoresist or metal or silicon oxide is formed over the second epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Using conventional photolithographic and etching techniques, the masking layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is partially etched away to expose substrate portions where the isolating regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the whole chip surface is ion implanted. In particular, heavy ions are implanted in the substrate portion where isolation is to be provided. As a consequence of the implantation, the structure of the layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> becomes &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; in the regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> After removing the masking layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the entire surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the whole substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is subjected to an oxidizing step. Thus, an oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed, which has a first portion <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> with a first thickness in the regions <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, while in the epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, it has a second portion <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> with a second thickness that is smaller than the first thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Under these conditions, the depth of the first portion of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will be greater than the depth of the second epitaxial layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the second layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is surface isolated from the edge of the structure and forms the anode of the diode. Advantageously, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be removed completely and a suitable insulation material may be substituted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An opening <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is then formed through the oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> such that at least a portion of the layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is exposed. The diode manufacturing process is then completed by forming conventional metal layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The method of this invention can also be applied to forming edge structures. For simplicity, a method of making an isolating structure for a diode as formed above will now be discussed with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In particular, the process for manufacturing such an edge structure will be described starting from the endpoint of the step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> that only shows the peripheral portion of layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the oxide layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is removed completely to form a trench <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A. Subsequently, a mask <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, known as a ring mask, is formed on the chip edge. This is followed by an implanting step that affects the whole chip. Advantageously, this implantation is provided at an inclination angle effective to produce an implanted region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> that extends across the bottom and the sidewalls of the trench <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A. After removal of the ring mask <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the method comprises carrying out an oxidation process all over the chip to form an oxide layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for diode edge isolation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To summarize, when the method of this invention is applied, isolating structures or trenches can be formed in the layers of silicon carbide by standard integrated circuit manufacturing techniques. In particular, by providing for portions of a silicon carbide layer to be damaged, as by implantation with heavy ions or dopant ions, the inventive method effectively improves the rate of oxidation of the silicon carbide layer. As a result, the process of removing the oxidized carbide layer is compatible with standard removal techniques for integrated circuits, making for faster and more efficient removal operations. </paragraph>
