<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In present-day aircraft radar systems, a single sweep of radar data is collected and displayed on a display for the pilot. Because only a single sweep of radar data is being displayed, large amounts of space are not being examined at all. This unexamined space may contain weather hazards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Some systems have attempted to allow a pilot to simultaneously view weather information from various regions of space. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,940,987; 5,202,690; 5,781,146; 5,828,332; and 5,920,276, to Fredrick present storing radar return data into a three-dimensional array that is apparently based on the tilt of the radar. &apos;987 presents generating a plan view that is selected according to tilt. The plan view image displays a span over a range of altitudes. Therefore, in order for a pilot to determine if an altitude above or below the aircraft&apos;s present altitude is clear of any weather hazards, the pilot must shift their visual focus to a vertical front or side view image. Fredrick also fails to present a full plan view-radar return data not in the present radar scan. In Fredrick, it is impossible to determine when the displayed radar return data was scanned, thus, possibly displaying old, erroneous data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Also, with respect to Fredrick, radar return data may be erroneously stored in memory due to stabilization errors of the radar system. When radar return data is stored in error, the resulting pilot display will contain inaccuracies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there exists a need to provide pilots with easily interpretable, accurate, and timely radar display information. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a system, method, and computer program product for providing improved radar return data storage, and display of the stored radar return data. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an example system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed in accordance with the present invention. The system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a weather radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a display processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, memory <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, an air data computer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and user interface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> coupled to the display processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The display processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to the radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the air data computer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and the memory <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. An example of the radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a radar controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (coupled to the user interface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>), a transmitter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a receiver <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and an antenna <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The radar controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> controls the transmitter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the receiver <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for performing the sending and receiving of signals through the antenna <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> based on aircraft data (i.e., position, heading, roll, yaw, pitch, etc.) received from the air data computer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a Flight Management System (FMS), Inertial Navigation System (INS), and/or a global positioning system (GPS). The air data computer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> generates air data based on signals received from various aircraft flight systems. The radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> transmits radar signals from the antenna <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> into space and receives return signals, if a target <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is contacted by the transmitted radar signal. Preferably, the radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> creates reflectivity values by basing the return signals on range, altitude, and other radar factors. The reflectivity values are sent to the display processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The display processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> translates the received reflectivity values for storage in a three-dimensional buffer in the memory <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. The display processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> then generates an image for presentation on the display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> based on any control signals sent from the user interface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or based on settings within the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,967 to Roos describes an apparatus and method for displaying weather information and is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The translated reflectivity values or return data, as determined by the radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, identify certain weather targets, such as rain/moisture, windshear, or turbulence. The type of weather target identified is based on a corresponding present algorithmic interpretation of the reflectivity values. The pilot selects the type of weather identified using the user interface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an example process performed by the display processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. First, at block <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> receives data from the radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that includes radar return data and time information of multiple radar sweeps. Next, at block <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> stores the received data in a three-dimensional buffer based on the current aircraft position supplied by the air data computer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, FMS, INS, or GPS. Finally, at block <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> retrieves data from the three-dimensional buffer based on a display signal sent by the user interface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or preset within the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The retrieval of data from the three-dimensional buffer is preferably based on aircraft flight data received from the air data computer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The retrieval of data from the three-dimensional buffer can be an analysis and processing of the data that generates a data product, such as an icon or feature display object, see optional block <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> between block <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the process of storing received radar return data into the three-dimensional buffer. This process illustrates how the return data associated with a single radar signal is inserted into the three-dimensional buffer. First, at block <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the current position of the aircraft is updated. Next, at block <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, radar data is separated into units based on time intervals. At block <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, each separated unit of radar data is assigned to a three-dimensional range bin. Then, at block <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, the geometry, in the coordinate system of a three-dimensional buffer with voxels, of each range bin is determined based on aircraft position, and radar tilt information. Next, at block <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, all the voxels in the three-dimensional buffer that correspond to the determined range bin geometry are assigned the radar data (reflectivity value) in the units that were assigned to the corresponding range bin based on current aircraft position. Also, each voxel is assigned a time value as to when it was most recently updated with the associated range bin information. In one embodiment, only the most recent radar data is stored in the voxel. In another embodiment, radar data from multiple times is stored. In this embodiment, several features can be added to the buffer, such as Time History Animation and Storm Trending. The following describes range bins in more detail. The radar signal transmitted from the antenna <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is radiated into space with a beam width that is a function of antenna size. The return radar signal of the radiated radar signal includes a number of reflectivity values separated in time or, in other words, a continuous reply signal translated into voltage values that identify target intensities. Time corresponds to distance from the aircraft. Each unit of time is considered a range bin and each range bin is assigned a volume of space based on the fact that the return signal received by the antenna <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is the reflectivity value received from a volume of space some distance from the aircraft. In one embodiment, the present invention uses a two-dimensional rectangular shape to define each range bin in order to simplify the math and perform processing in real-time when assigning the corresponding reflectivity value to the three-dimensional buffer voxels. The size of either a two or three-dimensional range bin is based on voxel size, desired resolution, and other radar and display factors. As will be shown in more detail below, the return radar signals are a result of overlapping transmitted radar signals. For simplicity, the present invention assigns the reflectivity values to non-overlapping range bins/rectangular blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of an aircraft <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> emanating three radar signals contained in conical volumes of space <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> along different radials. The radar signals in conical volume <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are along the same azimuth of the radar antenna and are overlapped according to an azimuth sample interval <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> identified as the separation between the centers of the volumes <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The volume <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> illustrates a radar signal at a tilt sample interval <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> from the adjacent tilt sweep identified by volumes <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. For example, with a <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&Prime; antenna, a 1&deg; azimuth sample interval <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and a 0.5&deg;-3.0&deg; tilt sample interval <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are used. The radar scan of the antenna is preferably executed in sweeps that are parallel to a horizon line, but could be performed vertically or by some other pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, a terrain map (not shown) with elevation data is used for ground clutter reduction. The terrain map has a resolution similar to the three-dimensional buffer. The terrain map is preferably organized as a two-dimensional circular buffer similar to a single layer of the buffer. During each range bin insertion into the buffer, the altitude of the lower edge of the bin or radar beam is used to compare with the elevation data stored in the terrain map at the same ground location. For example in a 30&Prime; antenna, a &minus;2.25&deg; offset from the center tilt setting or tilt bias is used as the lower edge value. Tilt settings and biases can be adaptive to adjust to varying signal environments, pilot references, and other factors. If the altitude is at or below the elevation, part or all of the range bin, and in turn corresponding voxels, are tagged as ground contaminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the three-dimensional buffer is relational to the earth. The x, y, z coordinates of the buffer correspond to x, y, z positions at some altitude above 0 ft Mean Sea Level (MSL). Therefore, because radar return data is not relational to the earth, the radar return data must be translated according to the earth&apos;s curvature for proper entry into the three-dimensional buffer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when radar return data shown in volume <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is translated into the three-dimensional buffer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> or, in other words voxels <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> within the three-dimensional buffer <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> are assigned values (i.e., reflectivity measurement (dBz)) from the radar return data of the volume <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the volume <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> occupied by the radar return data must be curved in order for the return data to be stored at the correct location relative to the earth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the three-dimensional buffer is a circular buffer. Once data from a range bin is inserted into the buffer, the data does not have to be copied again when the aircraft moves. Motion compensation of existing data is achieved by the simple act of moving the position reference of the aircraft relative to the buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a range bin <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> of the radar return data volume <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In order to store the radar return data into the proper voxels, coordinates <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> of each range bin must be found in the three-dimensional buffer coordinate system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the geometrical relationships required by the following equations for correcting range bin radar return data for the earth&apos;s curvature. Given the aircraft altitude (h) above the earth&apos;s surface (referenced to MSL), an antenna tilt value, and a slant range (r) along the path of the radar signal: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The above equations use radians for angular measurement and nautical miles for length. In this embodiment, a 4/3 earth model is used as the effective earth radius to correct for the curvature of radar rays due to atmospheric refraction in a normal atmosphere (<highlight><italic>Radar Handbook by Merrill Skolnik</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A &frac12; radar radar beamwidth angle is added to the tilt to come up with a line for finding the points for the upper edge and the lower edge of a range bin. Since each range bin is small (radius of curvature of the bin is large relative to the range depth of the bin), for real-time processing contraints, the edges of the range bin are approximated by straight lines. In one embodiment, the lower beam edge is taken to be y&deg; below the antenna tilt, the upper beam edge is x&deg; above the lower edge where x&deg; is the delta increment to the next tilt as determined by the scan strategy of the radar system. This is optimized to minimize ground return, and to minimize the effect of a radar signal beam width extending a storm to a much higher altitude than is actually occurring. The width of the range bin is a function of radar parameters and is centered on the azimuth reading of the radial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Since the ground range and altitude computation is independent of antenna azimuth, the results can be saved for use for other range bins in a single horizontal sweep of the antenna. Further, if the range bins are non-overlapping and touching between tilt steps, the determined upper edge of the range bins in one sweep becomes the lower edge of the range bins in the subsequent sweep. The range bins used were chosen in order to meet real-time processing requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Given an antenna azimuth value (az), the antenna tilt, the aircraft heading (hd), the aircraft location in the three-dimensional buffer space (x0, y0, z0) as received from the air data computer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, FMS, INS, or comparable source, and a horizontal radar beam width (bwh), the corner points (x, y, z) for the range bin are computed based on the geometrical relationships shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The resolution of the three-dimensional buffer depends upon a number of factors including the geometry and parameters of the transmitted radar signals and the detail of information desired for presentation on the display device. For example, for a 3&deg; radar beam width (3 dB beam width), the width of a range bin at approximately 10, approximately 100, and approximately 350 (the maximum display range currently supported) nautical miles (nm) from the antenna are about 0.3, 4, and 17 nm respectively. Therefore, in one embodiment for conserving memory and computational time for the translation of range bin information into the three-dimensional buffer coordinate system and assignment to voxels, two or more buffers of different resolution are used for storing associated reflectivity values. For example, a first short range buffer is used to store data up to 80 nm from the aircraft. A second long range buffer stores data up to 320 nm from the aircraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the minimum horizontal size of the three-dimensional buffer is 2*(range&plus;delta) where delta is the amount of aircraft movement before the buffer is overwritten, such as when the buffer is a circular buffer. For example, based on a speed of 600 knots, 10 nm is chosen as the delta, so that the buffer cannot wrap around in less than one minute. Otherwise, there is a possibility that data behind the aircraft is displayed as being in front of the aircraft since multiple points will be mapped to the same buffer location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Since there is a common area between the first and second buffers, data in the 80 nm buffer can be replicated into the 320 nm buffer during insertion. The short range buffer collects data out to 90 nm, and the long range buffer collects data out to 330 nm. The additional distance in each buffer is used to provide data between updates while the aircraft is in motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Since the entire region of the short range buffer is contained within the long range buffer, when data is extracted out to satisfy a given display request, the data can be combined from the two buffers to provide the highest resolution display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A first method for combining data from two buffers begins by extracting the entire set of radar data out of both buffers. The extracted two sets of radar data overlap up to the boundary of the short range buffer or the requested display range, whichever is less. The radar data from corresponding locations of the two buffers are compared with respect to time, with the newer radar data being chosen. Other merging criteria could be based on ground corruption status, Rain Echo Attenuation Compensation Technique (REACT) bit being set, or for identical time tags, short range data is chosen over long range data. The range beyond the short range buffer, if any, is of course selected from the long range buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A second method, for extracting radar data from the short and long range buffers is to simply extract any radar data from the short range buffer, and at a further range than the short range buffer, extract radar data from the long range buffer. Thus, there is no actual decision criteria (other than range) between the two buffers. This is only possible under select circumstances, such as that based on a designed scan strategy, in which case short range data is at least as fresh as the long range buffer data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Now that the buffer resolution is established, one can determine the most desirable range bin resolution. The voxel need not be a perfect cube. For example, the x, y, z dimensions of an 80 nm buffer is 0.3&times;0.3&times;0.4 nm per voxel, and an 320 nm buffer is 1.00&times;1.00&times;1.5 nm per voxel. If one chooses a range bin resolution small enough to guarantee all voxels along the path of the radial are filled, then each range bin can be inserted into the buffer as a rectangular surface rather than a volume. If the radar data of a radial is sampled at a higher resolution than the buffer, then it can be down sampled (using decimation, averaging, median, etc.) to the most desirable range bin resolution before inserting it into the buffer. Conversely, if the radar data of a radial is sampled at a lower resolution, then in one embodiment it is up-sampled before inserting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Radar Scan Strategy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A scan strategy is developed in order to fill the three-dimensional buffer as quickly as possibly (i.e., using as few antenna sweeps as possible) yet still provide an optimum display. The constraints or limits of a successful scan strategy are buffer update rate; maximum tilt step size; altitude and distance scan above and below the aircraft; maximum antenna scan rate; azimuth range; tilt range; and radar performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, because the scan strategy is aircraft altitude dependent, a new scan strategy is generated for every buffer update. A sequence of scan tilt angles is subdivided into three regions. For example, in a first region, the lower insertion beam edge intersects at approximately 10,000 ft below the aircraft and approximately 20 nm from the aircraft. Subsequent scans take a tilt step size of approximately 1.5&deg; until the lower beam edge intersects with earth and about 80 nm from aircraft. In the next region, a tilt step size of approximately 0.5&deg; is used until the lower beam edge intersects with the top of the buffer and about 80 nm from the aircraft. The last region uses a tilt step size of approximately 1.5&deg; until the lower beam edge intersects with the top of the buffer and about 20 nm from the aircraft. An additional scan is added to the sequence where the lower beam edge intersects with the radar horizon. The radar horizon is the point where the entire radar beam just misses hitting on the earth&apos;s surface. Once the sequence of tilt angles has been determined, one computes the slant range of the radar beam where the beam hits the earth&apos;s surface. The computed slant range value is used to limit the number of range bins for insertion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Display Capabilities </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> graphically illustrate two dimensional planes of stored radar data that are extracted from voxels in a three-dimensional buffer <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. The planes or the return data stored in each voxel of the plane are extracted from the three-dimensional buffer <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> by the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and sent as an image to the display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> horizontal plane <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is extracted by the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> based on an altitude selection and converted into a plan view image for presentation on the display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. This assumes that the buffer is stored in the Buffer Coordinate System, where it is referenced to the aircraft initial position in x and y and to the Earth in z. The displayed plan view image shows to the pilot all the radar data available at the selected altitude. The plane of data selected from voxels in the three-dimensional database <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is selected by the pilot using the user interface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or according to a preset parameter. For example, if the pilot was flying at 20,000 feet (ft) and wanted to examine a plan view of radar return data that exists at 25,000 ft, the pilot would simply select 25,000 ft using the user interface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, thereby directing the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to select the data assigned to all the voxels associated with 25,000 ft in the three-dimensional buffer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at some distance range relative to the aircraft&apos;s current position. This selected data is then converted into an image and presented on the display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, return data assigned to voxels in a vertical plane <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is retrieved for display as a result of a desire to present all of the radar return data for showing a vertical profile display extending from the aircraft to some set range distance value. In this example, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> selects or retrieves the radar data in voxels at a plane beginning at the aircraft&apos;s location. The selected plane is preferably parallel to the horizontal direction of travel of the aircraft. The processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> generates an image of the selected radar data and displays the image on the display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The displayed image shows the pilot what weather return data exists within a range of altitudes some distance from the aircraft. The altitude range and distance from the aircraft of the plane is determined by a user selection using the user interface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or by a presetting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a selection of return data from voxels from a number of planes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>from the three-dimensional buffer <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. If the pilot desires to see in a plan view of the radar return data that is available in a range of altitudes at some range of distance from the aircraft, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> retrieves all of the radar return data stored in the voxels associated with the volume of space defined by the desired range of altitudes and distances from the aircraft. The retrieved radar return data is then compiled by the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into a single two-dimensional image that is presented on the display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In this example, if voxels along a single vertical axis (common x, y value in the buffer <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>) from the aircraft include different radar return data, only the highest level return data is saved at that x, y position for the to-be-generated two-dimensional image. In one embodiment, the generated plan view image shows the pilot the strongest radar return data in volume of space. Other embodiments may take a weighted average, a median value, or some other linear function of return data, or select return data based on a threshold value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a single sweep of radar return data at three different points in time; sweeps <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> stores radar return data from a present sweep over that of previously stored radar return data. As shown in a two-dimensional representation in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, this embodiment results in radar return data <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> from previous sweeps to be still present in the three-dimensional buffer. Older radar return data in the three-dimensional buffer is typically less reliable than the most recently stored radar return data. Therefore, in this embodiment, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> time stamps the radar return data that is stored within the three-dimensional buffer. In this example, the stored radar data of each radial of a sweep is stored with the same time stamp. A sweep is motion of the radar antenna between the azimuth stops (e.g., &plusmn;90&deg;). Otherwise, if the radar system sweeps vertically, it sweeps from the upper to lower limit of the radar tilt (e.g., &plusmn;15&deg;). Because it is important to show the pilot that some of the radar return data is older or not as reliable, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> generates an image with data from voxels in the three-dimensional buffer differently depending upon their assigned time stamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a generated image <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> taken along the same plane of the buffer as the stored location for the return data of the sweeps <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. The image <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> corresponds to a display area <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> relating to the present aircraft location <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The image <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> visually identifies a difference between radar return data from sweep <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, sweep <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, and sweep <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. In this example, the image <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> will show the region of return data that is around the aircraft. The displayed visual difference is shown in one example by assigning colors to the return data depending upon the time stamp. For example, any radar return data retrieved from the buffer associated with sweep <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are displayed in blue in sections <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, because section <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> corresponds to buffer locations storing the radar data from sweep <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Any radar return data within the buffer associated with sweep <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are displayed in green in section <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and any radar return data within the buffer associated with sweep <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> are displayed in red in section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Other display methods can be used to show differences in the stored data, for example, various outlining or pixel intensity of the radar return data can be used. In other words, intensity values indicate age. The less intense a display object, then the older the stored associated return data. Preferably, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> compares associated time stamps with threshold values to determine how to display a corresponding display object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Radar System Tracking Failure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates an actual azimuth track <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> of radar sweep with a radar stabilization failure or some other radar system tracking failure. The azimuth track <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> does not follow an intended path <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> of the antenna that is supposed to be parallel to the horizon <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is informed by the radar system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that a stabilization failure has occurred or that just the azimuth tracking of the radar is failing in a certain manner and where this failure occurs. With this information, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> correctly inserts the radar return data produced at all locations along the track <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> into the proper location in the three-dimensional buffer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, line <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> shows a two-dimensional view of where the data generated by track <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is entered into the buffer. Therefore, when a request is made to the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to present an image along a straight line <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> or plane of voxels, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> only retrieves the radar return data in the voxels in the three-dimensional buffer associated with the entries along the requested straight line <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> does not extract the radar return data that deviates from that line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, if the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> senses that the aircraft is in a turn, the processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> retrieves return data from locations in the buffer that are in the direction of the turn and displays an image on the display device <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> accordingly. The processor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> senses that the aircraft is in a turn by interpreting data received from the air data system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or by a turn included in a flight plan that is to executed by the pilot or an autopilot. This embodiment allows the flight crew to determine if there exists any weather hazards in the turn direction, so as to avoid completing a turn into an existing weather hazard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is not limited by the disclosure of the preferred embodiment. </paragraph>
