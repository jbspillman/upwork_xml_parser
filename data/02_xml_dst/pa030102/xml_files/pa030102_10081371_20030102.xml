<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to a driving system for a discharge tube. In particular, the present invention relates to a multi-lamp driving system for a liquid crystal display backlight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A discharge tube, particularly a cold cathode fluorescent lamp, CCFL), is used as the light source for LCD backlight systems. The CCFL is typically driven by an inverter circuit, which provides DC current to a lamp and includes a feedback and control loop for stabilizing lamp currents. A large LCD panel usually requires two or more fluorescent lamps to provide sufficient backlighting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (Prior Art) is a multi-lamp driving system in a conventional device. The system includes a driving circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a transformer T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for driving two fluorescent lamps LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and has one feedback and control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The impedance difference of the lamps seriously influences the currents I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> though the lamps and therefore unbalances the distribution of the currents. However, the circuit in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> only controls the total current of the lamps LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and fails to balance the current through each of the lamps. The imbalance not only affects the illumination uniformity of the LCD panel due to insufficient luminance of those lamps having too small currents, but also shortens the life of individual lights and the backlight system due to overheat of those lamps having too large current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome the above disadvantage, some schemes using several driving circuits and transformers to drive a plurality of lamps and provide several feedback and control circuits for current regulation are proposed. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, driving circuits <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and transformers T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided to drive lamps LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In addition, the lamps LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to feedback and control circuits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This scheme balances the currents of lamps I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but requires more components and increases fabrication costs and product size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is necessary to provide a circuit balance technique for multi-lamp driving systems to solve the above problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a multi-lamp driving system, which directly controls the current balance among lamps. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a circuit diagram of the multi-lamp driving system in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, according to the first embodiment of the invention, the multi-lamp driving system comprises a driving circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a transformer T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a lamp set <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a current balance circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a feedback and control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The driving circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is coupled to the primary side of the transformer T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form an inverter circuit. The driving circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives input from a DC power source Vin and converting the DC signal to AC signal. Then, the transformer T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> steps up the voltage of the AC signal and output it from the secondary side to provide the power for the lamp set <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The lamp set <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises a first lamp LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a secondary lamp LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The current balance circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, coupled to a high voltage side of the combined lamp <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, comprises a first winding W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to the first lamp LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a second winding W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to the second lamp LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The first winding W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the second winding W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are wound on the same magnetic core and form a structure similar to a transformer. The coil number of the winding W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is equal to that of the winding W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The transformer with coil number ratio of 1:1 ensures that the voltages across/currents through the two windings equal to each other. Thus, balance between the current I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the lamp LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the current I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the lamp LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is achieved. The feedback and control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected between the low voltage side of the first lamp LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the driving circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It controls the driving circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the feedback current from the first lamp LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The feedback and control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is, for example, a pulse width modulation (PWM) controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a circuit diagram of the multi-lamp driving system in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is basically the same as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the first embodiment, with the difference that the low voltage terminal of the first lamp LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is connected to the low voltage terminal of the second lamp LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As well, the feedback and control circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls the driving circuit according to the total feedback current of the lamp LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the lamp LP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a circuit diagram of the multi-lamp driving system in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention. Unlike <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the first embodiment, the current balance circuit is connected between the low voltage side of the lamp set <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the feedback and loop circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The basic way of operation and the principle and the effect of the current balance are essentially the same as those of the circuit in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The multi-lamp driving system with the current balance circuit of the present invention is not only used for the above two-lamp application but also for multi-lamp applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a circuit diagram of the multi-lamp driving system in accordance with the fourth embodiment of the present invention. It is used to drive any number of lamps LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;LPn. In the embodiment, the current balance circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of windings W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;Wn coupled to the high voltage sides of a plurality of lamps LP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;LPn in the lamp set <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The windings W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;Wn are wound on the same magnetic core and have the same winding number. Because all the currents flowing through the windings W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;Wn are consequentially equal, balance among the currents I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;In of the lights I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;In is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a circuit diagram of the multi-lamp driving system in accordance with the fifth embodiment of the present invention. In applications with large numbers of lamps, because of the power rating of the transformer and other considerations on the manufacturing cost or circuit design, more than one transformer are used. For example, in the circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, three transformers T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are used to drive six lamps Lp<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;Lp<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in which each of the transformers is used to drive two of the lamps. Each of the high voltage terminals of the lamps Lp<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;Lp<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is coupled to one of the windings W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;W<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. As well, the windings W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;W<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are coupled to each other, and wound on the same magnetic core. Thereby, balance among the currents I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;I<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the lamps Lp<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;Lp<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is achieved. As in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the current balance circuit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may also be designed to connect to the low voltage side of the lamp set <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Finally, while the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of the preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements as would be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the scope of the appended claims should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements. </paragraph>
