<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to electronic document information management architectures and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for management and classification of document information thereby enabling authorized users to share document information via computer communication networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, wide spread and popularization of computer networks result in any individuals being enabled to directly open or &ldquo;publish&rdquo; information to anybody. One example is that a person such as a computer operator or user is enabled to issue information to people anywhere over the world via online computer network services such as electronic news, electronic mails (e-mails) and/or advanced computer system called the World-Wide Web (WWW), which links documents and pictures into a database that is stored in computers in many different parts of the world. Through the individual&apos;s information publication attempts based on his or her own free will, s/he has no specific difficulties in appealing self-characteristics and results of labor efforts. In addition, sharing such published individual&apos;s effort results and information as well as know-how and knowledge must lead to improvements in intellectual productivity in an organization as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such computer networks function as the infrastructure for information sharing. Recent rapid growth in computer network technologies pushes the information-sharing infrastructure to grow to offer enhanced performance and serviceabilies. Unfortunately, such infrastructure growth per se is merely to provide the necessary condition for common sharing or &ldquo;commonization&rdquo; of information. Completion of the infrastructure does not automatically guarantee any intended facilitation of the information sharing with increased accessibility and usability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An advantage as to improvements in intellectual productivity of the entirety of a group is expectable by mutual publication and common sharing, among individual associates or members who belong to the group, of information and knowledge plus know-hows or else which are stored and handled in a way independently of the group members for purposes of improvement in person-based intellectual productivity. Such information sharing over computer networks is typically achievable by use of online electronic bulletin boards and/or web pages on the Internet. Additionally, based on records of access results to presently published information, it is possible for an information publisher to roughly be aware of web-site visitors&apos; reactions to the published information being accessed for referencing purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Conventional known information sharing systems are faced with a problem that any contents are not registered positively. One major reason of this is that troublesome and time-consuming operations are required in document registration events. Another reason lies in the presence of complexities in procedure for selection of an appropriate destination of document file registration. A presently available approach to solving this problem is to employ a technique for enabling establishment of a multi-level hierarchical configuration of folders making up a folder hierarchy to thereby provide computer users with adequate services in a way pursuant to the users&apos; automatic folder classification processing requests, which technique is disclosed in JP-A-2000-89991. A file/folder selection facilitation technique is disclosed in JP-A-9-311805. This technique is for facilitating computer users to select an appropriate file suitable for storage of a new document and also a folder suitable for searching of certain documents that satisfy any desired search conditions. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The conventional information sharing systems offer a capability to provide information registration environments with reduced complexities and increased usabilities. Unfortunately these traditional systems fail to provide any successful approach to giving any positive incentive to information providers in accordance with information being provided. Due to this, the systems suffer from a problem as to the incapability to establish positive motivation toward information sharing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved electronic document information management technique capable of avoiding the problems in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to provide a document information management method and apparatus for permitting users to obtain and grasp know-hows of beneficial related information through publication and registration of electronic documents to thereby activate information sharing and/or knowledge sharing more effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To attain the foregoing objects the invention provides a document information management method and apparatus as designed to notify a document registrant of related or relevant information of presently available content-similar documents in a document registration event. Use of the document information management scheme unique to the invention enables users to effortlessly grasp relevant information useful to themselves through publication of information. This makes it possible to establish motivation of positive participation in information-sharing/knowledge-sharing. In this way, it is possible to achieve an advanced scheme, beyond realization of mere information sharing, for giving an information provider positive incentive in accordance with information being provided, which in turn makes it possible to facilitate and activate information sharing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the present invention will now be set forth with reference to some of the accompanying drawings below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a configuration of an electronic document management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The document management system shown herein is such that a document management server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a &ldquo;client&rdquo; personal computer (PC) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are operatively connected together via a network <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such as a local area network (LAN), Internet, public online communication links or the like. The document management server <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally constituted from a document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a collection of software programs for control of this database, including a document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a registration management information referencing program <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a similar document search program <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and a document displaying program <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment, the client PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is arranged to include a document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a display device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and an input device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is utilizable by Web browsers and is for operative association with respective programs within the document management server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is configured from a document storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and a search-use data storage unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> plus a registration management information storage unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The document storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is operable to store therein document data; the search data storage unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> stores therein search indexes and search structure indexes; and, the registration management information storage unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> stores definition information of properties of an object to be searched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The above is the configuration of the document management system embodying the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The document management system of this embodiment is arranged to search for more than one similar document while adding designation of a search object structure to search conditions, thereby acquiring related or relevant information of a document being registered. This is realizable by use of a similar document search technique for searching structured documents with increased similarity to a species or &ldquo;seed&rdquo; document, as has been disclosed in JP-A-2001-14326. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With the document management system of this embodiment, there is realized a method for permitting computer users to register documents to the document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. More specifically a user is expected to get the document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> started at the client PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and then designate a file of a document to be registered by use of the input device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and also input property values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> registers to the document storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of the document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> more than one registration document file as has been input from the client PC <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> along with the properties thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In addition, the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> creates search-use data based on the registration document file and its properties and then stores them in the search data storage unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Further, the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sets up a species or &ldquo;seed&rdquo; document for a similar document search based on the registration document file and its properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The registration management information referencing program <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> reads definition information of the properties of a to-be-searched object out of the registration management information storage unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> of the document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and then passes it to the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The similar document search program <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> uses the seed document that was set by the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as a search condition and then conducts a search with respect to the data accumulated in the document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The document display program <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> prepares related information of the registered document on the basis of a search result(s) of the similar document search program <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and then passes it to the document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> visually displays the relevant information of such registered document on the display <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A detailed explanation will next be given of an overview of the processing to be executed by the document management system in the illustrative embodiment. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a diagram showing an outline of the processing of the document management system in accordance with the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when a user &ldquo;m&rdquo; first designates a file of a to-be-registered document &ldquo;M&rdquo; from the document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and then inputs one or more property values, the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is called for execution of registration processing required. Here, one example of a new document registration view as displayed under control of the document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This new document registration view comes with several items, including a document file <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> and document properties <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight>. Designation of the document file <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> may be done by either direct input of a file name such as &ldquo;m.doc&rdquo; or alternatively by selection of an appropriate one from among a list of &ldquo;candidates&rdquo; of document names being displayed after clicking on a reference button icon. The document properties <highlight><bold>3010</bold></highlight> are to be input in such a way that a document name is &ldquo;DB Proposal&rdquo; with a client name specified as &ldquo;M bank&rdquo;. Lastly, upon clicking a registration button, the registration processing is executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> forms a search index M on the basis of the content of a file of a document M to be registered and then stores it in the search data storage unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Next, the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> calls the registration management information referencing program <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and then reads from the registration management information storage unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> definition information of the properties of an object to be searched. The search object property definition information defines more than one property for use as an object upon searching for related information of bibliography and relevant information of an organization. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, definition is made in such a way which follows: in the case of bibliography, property values of &ldquo;Industry Type&rdquo; and &ldquo;Client Name&rdquo; plus &ldquo;Document Name&rdquo; are regarded as the objects of interest; in the case of organization the property value of &ldquo;Belong To&rdquo; is regarded as the object. The document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is operatively responsive to receipt of the definition information of the above-noted search object(s) for producing more than one search structure index on the basis of the values of the registration document M&apos;s properties &ldquo;Industry Type&rdquo;, &ldquo;Client Name&rdquo;, &ldquo;Document Name&rdquo; and &ldquo;Belong To&rdquo;, which will then be stored in the search data storage unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Next, the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> sets up a species or &ldquo;seed&rdquo; document for a similar document search based on the registration document M&apos;s file and properties. Firstly, set in the seed document a content of the file of registration document M; then, let it be a search condition <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Next, set in the seed document a value &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; of the property &ldquo;Industry Type&rdquo; of the registration document M, a value &ldquo;M Bank&rdquo; of the property &ldquo;Client Name&rdquo; and a value &ldquo;DB Proposal&rdquo; of the property &ldquo;Document Name&rdquo;; then, let them be a search condition <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Next, refer to organization information to which the registered user m belongs to thereby set &ldquo;Finance 1G, ePJ&rdquo; in the seed document; then, let it be a search condition <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Here, an example of the user&apos;s organization information is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The organization information consists essentially of a user ID, organization and mail address. For instance, in case the user ID is &ldquo;a&rdquo;, it indicates that the user belongs to the organization &ldquo;Finance 3G&rdquo; and that his or her mail address is &ldquo;user_a.xxx.co.jp&rdquo;. Alternatively in the case of a user ID &ldquo;m&rdquo; as exemplarily shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the organization becomes &ldquo;Finance 1G, ePJ&rdquo;. This indicates that the user m belongs to two organizations of a group &ldquo;Finance 1G&rdquo; and a project &ldquo;ePJ&rdquo; as better shown in an organization constitution diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Next the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> calls the similar document search program <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for execution of similar document search processing. As a result of such similar document searching, a document ID and similarity of more than one similar document are obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The similar document search program <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> first conducts a search for any available similar document(s) with respect to the search condition <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to thereby obtain a result, which is regarded as a search result <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Next, with regard to the search condition <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, designate &ldquo;Industry Type&rdquo;, &ldquo;Client Name&rdquo; and &ldquo;Document Name&rdquo; as search object structures and then searches similar documents. Let this result be a search result <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Further, regarding the search condition <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, designate &ldquo;Belong To&rdquo; as a search object structure; then, search similar documents. Let this result be a search result <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The document display program <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> performs sorting in the order of higher similarities on the basis of the search results of the similar document search program <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and then prepares a list of related information items with the similarity and document ID plus document name and the like being as items to be visually displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> What has been discussed above is an explanation of the processing summary of the document management system in accordance with the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An explanation will next be given of a summary of a display method of the document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in this embodiment. There is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> an example of a document registration result display view that the document registration/display program <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> visually displays a result of document registration. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a view to be displayed as a result of new document registration as exemplarily shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The document registration result view displays a document ID as newly assigned to the presently registered documents along with related information thereof. One example is that in the case of a document &ldquo;DB Proposal&rdquo;, it is registered with a document ID <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. On the document registration result view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> list of documents which are similar to the registration document in content and bibliographic information plus organization information is displayed as the related information of the registration document. The related information is constituted from related information <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> concerning the content, related information <highlight><bold>3110</bold></highlight> as to the bibliographic information, and related information <highlight><bold>3120</bold></highlight> about the organization information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the document registration result view each related information consists essentially of prespecified display items including the similarity, document ID, document name, client name, industry type, belong-to, and registration date, wherein the documents are displayed in such a manner that these are listed in the order that a document of higher similarity precedes the others. When a computer user clicks the document name of any given document within the related information, a corresponding application gets started enabling the user to refer to a document content. Alternatively when the user clicks the registrant of any given document within the related information, s/he can refer to an electronic mail (e-mail) address of the registrant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The related information <highlight><bold>3100</bold></highlight> is a list of certain documents that are similar in content to the registration document. In this example, first, the registration document per se is displayed as a similarity <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at the top of the list; next, a list of documents is being displayed in such a manner that their similarities are sorted in the order of <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. In this case, the user &ldquo;m&rdquo; who is a document registrant can recognize that a user &ldquo;a&rdquo; who is in charge of clients of the same industry type and another user &ldquo;b&rdquo; who is expected to handle clients of a different industry type have already registered proposal documents which are much similar in content while also being permitted to perform communications with them whenever the need arises. Whereby, they are enabled to share know-hows such as common technical information, problems to be solved, client needs and others, without regard to differences in industry type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The related information <highlight><bold>3110</bold></highlight> is for indication of an up-to-date registration situation of some documents similar in bibliographic information. Displayed as the bibliographic information is the similarity with document name and client name plus industry type being as the objects of interest. In this example, first, the registration document per se is displayed with a similarity <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at the top of the list; next, a document list is being displayed in such a manner that similarities are in the order of <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this case it is possible for the user m who is the document registrant to recognize that a user &ldquo;d&rdquo; who is in charge of clients of the same industry type and the user &ldquo;b&rdquo; who is expected to handle clients of a different industry type have already registered their proposal documents much similar in content while also being permitted to perform communications with them when the need arises. Whereby, they are enabled to share know-hows such as a wide variety of client needs and case-study information or else. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The related information <highlight><bold>3120</bold></highlight> is the one that indicates the last updated registration situation of documents similar in organization information. Displayed as the organization information is a list of documents of &ldquo;Belong To&rdquo; having similar values to the organization &ldquo;Finance 1G, ePJ&rdquo; to which the user m belongs. In this example the registration document per se is first displayed with a similarity <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> at the top of the list; next, a document list is displayed in such a manner that similarities are in the order of <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This makes it possible for the user m who is the document registrant to grasp the up-to-date registration situation of a user &ldquo;f&rdquo; in the same group and also that of a user &ldquo;g&rdquo; in the same project, which in turn enables them to share business in-progress information and know-hows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An explanation will next be given of a detailed procedure of document registration processing of the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the illustrative embodiment, with reference to a flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, acquire a file of the user&apos;s designated document for registration along with its properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2010</bold></highlight>, register the registration document file and its properties to the document storage unit <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of the document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; then, obtain a document ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2020</bold></highlight>, extract text data from a content of the registration document file; then, create more than one search index; next, store it in the search data storage unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2030</bold></highlight>, call the registration management information referencing program <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to obtain definition information of the to-be-searched object&apos;s properties while referring to the registration management information storage unit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2040</bold></highlight> prepare a search structure index from the property value(s) of the registration document and then store it in the search data storage unit <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the document database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2050</bold></highlight> create one or more species or &ldquo;seed&rdquo; documents for use during search for any available related information of the document being registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2060</bold></highlight> call the similar document search program <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for execution of a similar document search with the seed documents as search conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2070</bold></highlight> determine whether the similar document search has been executed relative to all the seed documents involved. If YES at step <highlight><bold>2070</bold></highlight> then the system procedure goes to step <highlight><bold>2080</bold></highlight>. If NO at step <highlight><bold>2070</bold></highlight> then return to step <highlight><bold>2060</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2080</bold></highlight>, call the document display program <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which makes use of both the similarity obtained as a result of the similar document search session and the resultant list of similar documents to prepare related information for visual on-screen display purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the user&apos;s document registration in the way stated above, a list of specific documents is visually displayed as the related information required, which documents are similar to the registration document in content and in bibliographic information and also in organization information. Whereby it becomes possible for the user to grasp related information beneficial to himself or herself through publication of information without suffering from any troublesome and time-consuming works, which in turn provides motivation of positive and &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; participation in information-sharing/knowledge-sharing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the user performs document registration in the way discussed above, related information as to the content of such document is visually displayed. Thus it is possible for the user to become aware of the presence of business, personnel or organization having similar purposes and a tackle situation in a view point of the similarity of document content through the user&apos;s document publication, which in turn makes it possible for the user to grasp any available related or relevant information that is useful to himself or herself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In addition, when the user performs document registration in the way stated above, related information as to the bibliographic information of such document is visually displayed. Thus it is possible for the user to become aware of the presence of a business or personnel in similar fields or categories and a tackle situation in a view point of the similarity of document bibliographic information through the user&apos;s document publication, which in turn makes it possible for the user to grasp any available related or relevant information useful to himself or herself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Additionally, when the user performs document registration in the way noted above, related information as to the organization information is visually displayed. Thus it is possible for the user to become aware of the document registration situation and/or in-progress status or else of the people who takes part of the same business in a viewpoint of the similarity of the registrant&apos;s organization information through the user&apos;s document publication, which in turn makes it possible for the user to grasp any available relevant information useful to himself or herself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Optionally it may also be possible to select for display certain documents high in similarity from among the related information items of the registration document. This makes it possible for the user to efficiently grasp his or her useful relevant information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> With the procedure discussed above, it is possible to accelerate plus (facilitation) factors on the document provider side, thereby enabling establishment of motivation of positive participation in information-sharing/knowledge-sharing. In other words, it is possible to give positive incentive to information providers in accordance with provision information rather than realization of mere information sharing, thus enabling facilitation and activation of information sharing. The above is the explanation of the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> An explanation will be given of an event for document registration with a folder designated, as a second embodiment of the present invention, with reference to some of the attached drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Firstly, an example of a folder configuration for document registration is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The folder structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is based on a viewpoint of industry types, wherein a folder with a first hierarchical level is for &ldquo;Industry Type&rdquo; whereas second hierarchical folders are &ldquo;Common&rdquo;, &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo;. One example is that in a case the user designates a &ldquo;Banks&rdquo; folder <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> as a registration destination of a document M, a registration result view such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is to be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an exemplary document registration result view in the case of document registration while designating a folder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> On the document registration result view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, folder information <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight> is displayed in addition to the display contents of the document registration result view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In the folder information <highlight><bold>3300</bold></highlight>, there are explained that folder icons with star marks added thereto are indicative of the folders with a document M &ldquo;DB Proposal&rdquo; registered to each of them, that is, &ldquo;Industry Type/Finance/Banks&rdquo;, whereas folder icons with no star marks added thereto are for indication of the remaining folders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the document registration result view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it displays, in units of documents of related information, whether such a document has been registered to the same folder of a to-be-registered or &ldquo;registration&rdquo; document M. In the case of registration to the same folder as the registration document M, display a folder icon <highlight><bold>3310</bold></highlight>; alternatively if registration is made to a different folder then display a folder icon <highlight><bold>3320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> For example, it is understandable that a document &ldquo;Unity System&rdquo; of a document ID <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is presently registered to the same folder as the registration document M. On the other hand, a document &ldquo;Next-Term DB Proposal&rdquo; of document ID <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is registered to a different folder from that of the registration document M, e.g. a &ldquo;Life Insurance&rdquo; folder <highlight><bold>3210</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, so a folder icon <highlight><bold>3320</bold></highlight> is being displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> An explanation will next be given of a detailed procedure of document registration processing of the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of this embodiment by use of a flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Main part of the processing flow covering from step <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> to step <highlight><bold>2070</bold></highlight> is the same as the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>; thus, an explanation thereof is eliminated herein for brevity purposes only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight>, call the document display program <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> for acquisition of folder information of a storage destination of each document based on the similarity and list of similar document(s) as have been obtained as a result of a similar document search; then, prepare related information thereof, which will then be visually displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The above is the explanation of the practical procedure of the document registration processing of the document registration program <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> An explanation will next be given of the user&apos;s operations with respect to folder icons. Upon clicking of a folder icon <highlight><bold>3310</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>3320</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it is possible to refer to any documents being presently registered to such folder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> For instance, in the event that the user clocks the folder icon <highlight><bold>3310</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> list of those documents residing within the registration destination folder &ldquo;Industry Type/Fiance/Banks&rdquo; is to be displayed on the document registration result view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In such a case, each document is displayed together with its own similarity of content relative to a document being registered. Alternatively when clocking the folder icon <highlight><bold>3320</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> list of documents within another folder &ldquo;Industry Type/Insurance/Life&rdquo; is displayed in the document registration result view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In this case also, each document is displayed in association with its own similarity of content relative to the document being registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Whenever the user designates his or her preferred registration destination folder upon registering of a document, notification is made of any available related information of more than one similar document within the registration destination folder. Whereby, it becomes possible for the user to grasp any beneficial relevant information within the registration designation folder through the user&apos;s information publication, which in turn permits establishment of motivation of positive participation in information/knowledge sharing. In addition, as it becomes possible to judge whether such folder is appropriate for use as a destination of registration, which in turn gives a sense of security to the document provider side resulting in removal of any possible minus (obstruction) factors as to information sharing; thus, the information sharing may further be activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In addition, whenever the user designates a registration destination folder upon his or her registration of a document, there is also notified the related or relevant information of any available similar documents residing within folders other than the registration destination folder. Whereby it becomes possible to grasp relevant information with respect also to those folders other than the aimed or &ldquo;target&rdquo; folder, which in turn makes it possible for the user to obtain useful business information while referring to the documents that have been registered in a wide variety of viewpoints. Additionally in a case the user judges that a folder other than the target folder is deemed to be more appropriate for use as the registration destination, s/he is enabled to take a proper action such as changing the registration destination or other similar suitable actions, which in turn gives a sense of security to the document provider side resulting in removal of any possible minus (obstruction) factors as to information sharing; thus, the information sharing may further be activated. The above is the explanation of the second embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> An explanation will be given of a case of registration of a document while letting it be associated with a plurality of folders, as a third embodiment of the present invention, in conjunction with some of the accompanying drawings. First see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, which shows an exemplary folder structure for document registration. The folder structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is based on three different viewpoints: industry types, products, and clients. For example, it is possible for the computer user to designate as his or her preferred destination for registration of a document M a &ldquo;Banks&rdquo; folder <highlight><bold>3200</bold></highlight>, a &ldquo;DB&rdquo; folder <highlight><bold>3400</bold></highlight> and an &ldquo;M Bank&rdquo; folder <highlight><bold>3410</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In such case, a document registration result view such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is to be displayed as a result of the registration. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is an example of the document registration result view in a case a document was registered while designating a plurality of folders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the document registration result view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, it is possible to change or switch between display patterns of resultant related information in a viewpoint of the folder structure. In the case of switching between related information displays, click a list box <highlight><bold>3500</bold></highlight> of a registration destination folder shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Upon clicking of the list box <highlight><bold>3500</bold></highlight>, a list of registration destination folders is displayed as a menu. One example is that in the case of a registration document M, &ldquo;Industry Type/Finance/Banks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Products/DB&rdquo; plus &ldquo;Clients/M Bank&rdquo; are displayed in the form of a menu, which permits the user to choose his or her desired folder from among them. As a result, a folder icon <highlight><bold>3510</bold></highlight> pursuant to the folder switching is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, even in the case of document registration with a plurality of folders designated at a time, it is possible for the user to grasp not only the related information residing within the registration destination folders but also the related information within other folders, and thus becomes possible to obtain any available useful business information while referring to documents as registered in a variety of aspects. To be brief, it is possible for the user to grasp any beneficial relevant information through document publication and registration, which in turn makes it possible to accomplish motivation of positive or aggressive participation in information-sharing/knowledge-sharing to thereby enable successful activation of information/knowledge sharing with increased efficiencies. What is stated above is the explanation of the third embodiment of the invention as disclosed and claimed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it becomes possible for the user to grasp related information beneficial to himself or herself by way of the information publication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention and that various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
