<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to nucleic acids covalently coupled to electrodes via conductive oligomers. More particularly, the invention is directed to the site-selective modification of nucleic acids with electron transfer moieties and electrodes to produce a new class of biomaterials, and to methods of making and using them. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The detection of specific nucleic acids is an important tool for diagnostic medicine and molecular biology research. Gene probe assays currently play roles in identifying infectious organisms such as bacteria and viruses, in probing the expression of normal genes and identifying mutant genes such as oncogenes, in typing tissue for compatibility preceding tissue transplantation, in matching tissue or blood samples for forensic medicine, and for exploring homology among genes from different species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Ideally, a gene probe assay should be sensitive, specific and easily automatable (for a review, see Nickerson, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 4:48-51 (1993)). The requirement for sensitivity (i.e. low detection limits) has been greatly alleviated by the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other amplification technologies which allow researchers to amplify exponentially a specific nucleic acid sequence before analysis (for a review, see Abramson et al., Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 4:41-47 (1993)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Specificity, in contrast, remains a problem in many currently available gene probe assays. The extent of molecular complementarity between probe and target defines the specificity of the interaction. Variations in the concentrations of probes, of targets and of salts in the hybridization medium, in the reaction temperature, and in the length of the probe may alter or influence the specificity of the probe/target interaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It may be possible under some limited circumstances to distinguish targets with perfect complementarity from targets with mismatches, although this is generally very difficult using traditional technology, since small variations in the reaction conditions will alter the hybridization. New experimental techniques for mismatch detection with standard probes include DNA ligation assays where single point mismatches prevent ligation and probe digestion assays in which mismatches create sites for probe cleavage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Finally, the automation of gene probe assays remains an area in which current technologies are lacking. Such assays generally rely on the hybridization of a labelled probe to a target sequence followed by the separation of the unhybridized free probe. This separation is generally achieved by gel electrophoresis or solid phase capture and washing of the target DNA, and is generally quite difficult to automate easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The time consuming nature of these separation steps has led to two distinct avenues of development. One involves the development of high-speed, high-throughput automatable electrophoretic and other separation techniques. The other involves the development of non-separation homogeneous gene probe assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> PCT application WO 95/15971 describes novel compositions comprising nucleic acids containing electron transfer moieties, including electrodes, which allow for novel detection methods of nucleic acid hybridization. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The present invention capitalizes on the previous discovery that electron transfer apparently proceeds through the stacked &pgr;-orbitals of the heterocyclic bases of double stranded (hybridized) nucleic acid (&ldquo;the &pgr;-way&rdquo;). This finding allows the use of nucleic acids containing electron transfer moieties to be used as nucleic acid probes. See PCT publication WO 95/15971, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, and cited references. This publication describes the site-selective modification of nucleic acids with redox active moieties, i.e. electron donor and acceptor moieties, which allow the long-distance electron transfer through a double stranded nucleic acid. In general, electron transfer between electron donors and acceptors does not occur at an appreciable rate when the nucleic acid is single stranded, nor does it occur appreciably unless nucleotide base pairing exists in the double stranded sequence between the electron donor and acceptor in the double helical structure. Thus, PCT publication WO 95/15971 and the present invention are directed to the use of nucleic acids with electron transfer moieties, including electrodes, as probes for the detection of target sequences within a sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention provides for novel gene probes, which are useful in molecular biology and diagnostic medicine. In this embodiment, single stranded nucleic acids having a predetermined sequence and covalently attached electron transfer moieties, including an electrode, are synthesized. The sequence is selected based upon a known target sequence, such that if hybridization to a complementary target sequence occurs in the region between the electron donor and the electron acceptor, electron transfer proceeds at an appreciable and detectable rate. Thus, the invention has broad general use, as a new form of labelled gene probe. In addition, the probes of the present invention allow detection of target sequences without the removal of unhybridized probe. Thus, the invention is uniquely suited to automated gene probe assays or field testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides improved compositions comprising nucleic acids covalently attached via conductive oligomers to an electrode, of a general structure depicted below in Structure 1:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In Structure 1, the hatched marks on the left represent an electrode. X is a conductive oligomer as defined herein. F<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is a linkage that allows the covalent attachment of the electrode and the conductive oligomer, including bonds, atoms or linkers such as is described herein, for example as &ldquo;A&rdquo;, defined below. F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is a linkage that allows the covalent attachment of the conductive oligomer to the nucleic acid, and may be a bond, an atom or a linkage as is herein described. F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may be part of the conductive oligomer, part of the nucleic acid, or exogeneous to both, for example, as defined herein for &ldquo;Z&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;nucleic acid&rdquo; or &ldquo;oligonucleotide&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein means at least two nucleotides covalently linked together. A nucleic acid of the present invention will generally contain phosphodiester bonds, although in some cases, as outlined below, nucleic acid analogs are included that may have alternate backbones, comprising, for example, phosphoramide (Beaucage et al., Tetrahedron 49(10):1925 (1993) and references therein; Letsinger, J. Org. Chem. 35:3800 (1970); Sprinzl et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 81:579 (1977); Letsinger et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 14:3487 (1986); Sawai et al, Chem. Lett. 805 (1984), Letsinger et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110:4470 (1988); and Pauwels et al., Chemica Scripta 26:141 91986)), phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, O-methylphophoroamidite linkages (see Eckstein, Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press), and peptide nucleic acid backbones and linkages (see Egholm, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114:1895 (1992); Meier et al., Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 31:1008 (1992); Nielsen, Nature, 365:566 (1993); Carlsson et al., Nature 380:207 (1996), all of which are incorporated by reference). Nucleic acids containing one or more carbocyclic sugars are also included within the definition of nucleic acids (see Jenkins et al., Chem. Soc. Rev. (1995) ppl69-176). Several nucleic acid analogs are described in Rawls, C &amp; E News Jun. 2, 1997 page 35, hereby incorporated by reference. These modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of electron transfer moieties, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Particularly preferred are peptide nucleic acids (PNA). These backbones are substantially non-ionic under neutral conditions, in contrast to the highly charged phosphodiester backbone of naturally occurring nucleic acids. This results in two advantages. First, the PNA backbone exhibits improved hybridization kinetics. PNAs have larger changes in the melting temperature (Tm) for mismatched versus perfectly matched basepairs. DNA and RNA typically exhibit a 2-4&deg; C. drop in Tm for an internal mismatch. With the non-ionic PNA backbone, the drop is closer to 7-9&deg; C. This allows for better detection of mismatches. Similarly, due to their non-ionic nature, hybridization of the bases attached to these backbones is relatively insensitive to salt concentration. This is particularly advantageous in the systems of the present invention, as a reduced salt hybridization solution has a lower Faradaic current than a physiological salt solution (in the range of 150 mM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acids may be single stranded or double stranded, as specified, or contain portions of both double stranded or single stranded sequence. The nucleic acid may be DNA, both genomic and cDNA, RNA or a hybrid, where the nucleic acid contains any combination of deoxyribo- and ribo-nucleotides, and any combination of bases, including uracil, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, inosine, xathanine and hypoxathanine, etc. As used herein, the term &ldquo;nucleoside&rdquo; includes nucleotides, and modified nucleosides such as amino modified nucleosides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The nucleosides and nucleic acids are covalently attached to a conductive oligomer. By &ldquo;conductive oligomer&rdquo; herein is meant a substantially conducting oligomer, preferably linear, some embodiments of which are referred to in the literature as &ldquo;molecular wires&rdquo;. By &ldquo;substantially conducting&rdquo; herein is meant that the rate of electron transfer through the conductive oligomer is faster than the rate of electron transfer through single stranded nucleic acid, such that the conductive oligomer is not the rate limiting step in the detection of hybridization, although as noted below, systems which use spacers that are the rate limiting step are also acceptable. Stated differently, the resistance of the conductive oligomer is less than that of the nucleic acid. Preferably, the rate of electron transfer through the conductive oligomer is faster than the rate of electron transfer through double stranded nucleic acid, i.e. through the stacked &pgr;-orbitals of the double helix. Generally, the conductive oligomer has substantially overlapping &pgr;-orbitals, i.e. conjugated &pgr;-orbitals, as between the monomeric units of the conductive oligomer, although the conductive oligomer may also contain one or more sigma (&sgr;) bonds. Additionally, a conductive oligomer may be defined functionally by its ability to inject or receive electrons into or from an attached nucleic acid. Furthermore, the conductive oligomer is more conductive than the insulators as defined herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the conductive oligomers have a conductivity, S, of from between about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>to about 10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, with from about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>to about 10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>being preferred, with these S values being calculated for molecules ranging from about 20 &angst; to about 200 &angst;. As described below, insulators have a conductivity S of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>or lower, with less than about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>being preferred. See generally Gardner et al., Sensors and Actuators A 51 (1995) 57-66, incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Desired characteristics of a conductive oligomer include high conductivity, sufficient solubility in organic solvents and/or water for synthesis and use of the compositions of the invention, and preferably chemical resistance to reactions that occur i) during nucleic acid synthesis (such that nucleosides containing the conductive oligomers may be added to a nucleic acid synthesizer during the synthesis of the compositions of the invention), ii) during the attachment of the conductive oligomer to an electrode, or iii) during hybridization assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The oligomers of the invention comprise at least two monomeric subunits, as described herein. As is described more fully below, oligomers include homo- and hetero-oligomers, and include polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the conductive oligomer has the structure depicted in Structure 2:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As will be understood by those in the art, all of the structures depicted herein may have additional atoms or structures; i.e. the conductive oligomer of Structure 2 may be attached to electron transfer moieties, such as electrodes, transition metal complexes, organic electron transfer moieties, and metallocenes, and to nucleic acids, or to several of these. Unless otherwise noted, the conductive oligomers depicted herein will be attached at the left side to an electrode; that is, as depicted in Structure 2, the left &ldquo;Y&rdquo; is connected to the electrode as described herein and the right &ldquo;Y&rdquo;, if present, is attached to the nucleic acid, either directly or through the use of a linker, as is described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, Y is an aromatic group, n is an integer from 1 to 50, g is either 1 or zero, e is an integer from zero to 10, and m is zero or 1. When g is 1, B-D is a conjugated bond, preferably selected from acetylene, alkene, substituted alkene, amide, azo, &mdash;&boxH;N&mdash;(including &mdash;N&boxH;C&mdash;, &mdash;CR&boxH;N&mdash; and &mdash;N&boxH;CR&mdash;), &mdash;Si&boxH;Si&mdash;, and &mdash;Si&boxH;C&mdash;(including &mdash;C&boxH;Si&mdash;, &mdash;Si&boxH;CR&mdash; and &mdash;CR&boxH;Si&mdash;&mdash;). When g is zero, e is preferably 1, D is preferably carbonyl, or a heteroatom moiety, wherein the heteroatom is selected from oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen or phosphorus. Thus, suitable heteroatom moieties include, but are not limited to, &mdash;NH and &mdash;NR, wherein R is as defined herein; substituted sulfur; sulfonyl (&mdash;SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;) sulfoxide (&mdash;SO&mdash;); phosphine oxide (&mdash;PO&mdash; and &mdash;RPO&mdash;); and thiophosphine (&mdash;PS&mdash; and &mdash;RPS&mdash;). However, when the conductive oligomer is to be attached to a gold electrode, as outlined below, sulfur derivatives are not preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;aromatic group&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein is meant an aromatic monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon moiety generally containing 5 to 14 carbon atoms (although larger polycyclic rings structures may be made) and any carbocylic ketone or thioketone derivative thereof, wherein the carbon atom with the free valence is a member of an aromatic ring. Aromatic groups include arylene groups and aromatic groups with more than two atoms removed. For the purposes of this application aromatic includes heterocycle. &ldquo;Heterocycle&rdquo; or &ldquo;heteroaryl&rdquo; means an aromatic group wherein 1 to 5 of the indicated carbon atoms are replaced by a heteroatom chosen from nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron and silicon wherein the atom with the free valence is a member of an aromatic ring, and any heterocyclic ketone and thioketone derivative thereof. Thus, heterocycle includes thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, pyrimidinyl, oxalyl, indolyl, purinyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, thiazolyl, imidozyl, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Importantly, the Y aromatic groups of the conductive oligomer may be different, i.e. the conductive oligomer may be a heterooligomer. That is, a conductive oligomer may comprise a oligomer of a single type of Y groups, or of multiple types of Y groups. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, when a barrier monolayer is used as is described below, one or more types of Y groups are used in the conductive oligomer within the monolayer with a second type(s) of Y group used above the monolayer level. Thus, as is described herein, the conductive oligomer may comprise Y groups that have good packing efficiency within the monolayer at the electrode surface, and a second type(s) of Y groups with greater flexibility and hydrophilicity above the monolayer level to facilitate nucleic acid hybridization. For example, unsubstituted benzyl rings may comprise the Y rings for monolayer packing, and substituted benzyl rings may be used above the monolayer. Alternatively, heterocylic rings, either substituted or unsubstituted, may be used above the monolayer. Additionally, in one embodiment, heterooligomers are used even when the conductive oligomer does not extend out of the monolayer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The aromatic group may be substituted with a substitution group, generally depicted herein as R. R groups may be added as necessary to affect the packing of the conductive oligomers, i.e. when the nucleic acids attached to the conductive oligomers form a monolayer on the electrode, R groups may be used to alter the association of the oligomers in the monolayer. R groups may also be added to 1) alter the solubility of the oligomer or of compositions containing the oligomers; 2) alter the conjugation or electrochemical potential of the system; and 3) alter the charge or characteristics at the surface of the monolayer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, when the conductive oligomer is greater than three subunits, R groups are preferred to increase solubility when solution synthesis is done. However, the R groups, and their positions, are chosen to minimally effect the packing of the conductive oligomers on a surface, particularly within a monolayer, as described below. In general, only small R groups are used within the monolayer, with larger R groups generally above the surface of the monolayer. Thus for example the attachment of methyl groups to the portion of the conductive oligomer within the monolayer to increase solubility is preferred, with attachment of longer alkoxy groups, for example, C3 to C10, is preferably done above the monolayer surface. In general, for the systems described herein, this generally means that attachment of sterically significant R groups is not done on any of the first three oligomer subunits, depending on the length of the insulator molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Suitable R groups include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, alkyl, alcohol, aromatic, amino, amido, nitro, ethers, esters, aldehydes, sulfonyl, silicon moieties, halogens, sulfur containing moieties, phosphorus containing moieties, and ethylene glycols. In the structures depicted herein, R is hydrogen when the position is unsubstituted. It should be noted that some positions may allow two substitution groups, R and R&prime;, in which case the R and R&prime; groups may be either the same or different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;alkyl group&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein is meant a straight or branched chain alkyl group, with straight chain alkyl groups being preferred. If branched, it may be branched at one or more positions, and unless specified, at any position. The alkyl group may range from about 1 to about 30 carbon atoms (C1-C30), with a preferred embodiment utilizing from about 1 to about carbon atoms (C1-C20), with about C1 through about C12 to about C15 being preferred, and C1 to C5 being particularly preferred, although in some embodiments the alkyl group may be much larger. Also included within the definition of an alkyl group are cycloalkyl groups such as C5 and C6 rings, and heterocyclic rings with nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur or phosphorus. Alkyl also includes heteroalkyl, with heteroatoms of sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, and silicone being preferred. Alkyl includes substituted alkyl groups. By &ldquo;substituted alkyl group&rdquo; herein is meant an alkyl group further comprising one or more substitution moieties &ldquo;R&rdquo;, as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;amino groups&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein is meant &mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &mdash;NHR and &mdash;NR<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups, with R being as defined herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;nitro group&rdquo; herein is meant an &mdash;NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;sulfur containing moieties&rdquo; herein is meant compounds containing sulfur atoms, including but not limited to, thia-, thio- and sulfo-compounds, thiols (&mdash;SH and &mdash;SR), and sulfides (&mdash;RSR&mdash;). By &ldquo;phosphorus containing moieties&rdquo; herein is meant compounds containing phosphorus, including, but not limited to, phosphines and phosphates. By &ldquo;silicon containing moieties&rdquo; herein is meant compounds containing silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;ether&rdquo; herein is meant an &mdash;O&mdash;R group. Preferred ethers include alkoxy groups, with &mdash;O&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and &mdash;O&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>being preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;ester&rdquo; herein is meant a &mdash;COOR group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;halogen&rdquo; herein is meant bromine, iodine, chlorine, or fluorine. Preferred substituted alkyls are partially or fully halogenated alkyls such as CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>

Ethylene glycol derivatives with other heteroatoms in place of oxygen (i.e. &mdash;(N&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash; or &mdash;(S&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;, or with substitution groups) are also preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Preferred substitution groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, alkoxy groups such as &mdash;O&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and &mdash;O&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and ethylene glycol and derivatives thereof. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the conductive oligomers depicted herein, when g is 1, B-D is a bond linking two atoms or chemical moieties. In a preferred embodiment, B-D is a conjugated bond, containing overlapping or conjugated &pgr;-orbitals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Preferred B-D bonds are selected from acetylene (&mdash;C&equiv;C&mdash;, also called alkyne or ethyne), alkene (&mdash;CH&boxH;CH&mdash;, also called ethylene), substituted alkene (&mdash;CR&boxH;CR&mdash;, &mdash;CH&boxH;CR&mdash; and &mdash;CR&boxH;CH&mdash;), amide (&mdash;NH&mdash;CO&mdash; and &mdash;NR&mdash;CO&mdash; or &mdash;CO&mdash;NH&mdash; and &mdash;CO&mdash;NR&mdash;), azo (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> N&boxH;N&mdash;), esters and thioesters (&mdash;CO&mdash;O&mdash;, &mdash;O&mdash;CO&mdash;, &mdash;CS&mdash;O&mdash; and &mdash;O&mdash;CS&mdash;) and other conjugated bonds such as (&mdash;CH&boxH;N&mdash;, &mdash;CR&boxH;N&mdash;, &mdash;N&boxH;CH&mdash; and &mdash;N&boxH;CR&mdash;), (&mdash;SiH&boxH;SiH&mdash;, &mdash;SiR&boxH;SiH&mdash;, &mdash;SiR&boxH;SiH&mdash;, and &mdash;SiR&boxH;SiR&mdash;), (&mdash;SiH&boxH;CH&mdash;, &mdash;SiR&boxH;CH&mdash;, &mdash;SiH&boxH;CR&mdash;, &mdash;SiR&boxH;CR&mdash;,&mdash;CH&boxH;SiH&mdash;, &mdash;CR&boxH;SiH&mdash;,&mdash;CH&boxH;SiR&mdash;, and &mdash;CR&boxH;SiR&mdash;). Particularly preferred B-D bonds are acetylene, alkene, amide, and substituted derivatives of these three, and azo. Especially preferred B-D bonds are acetylene, alkene and amide. The oligomer components attached to double bonds may be in the trans or cis conformation, or mixtures. Thus, either B or D may include carbon, nitrogen or silicon. The substitution groups are as defined as above for R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> When g&equals;0 in the Structure 2 conductive oligomer, e is preferably 1 and the D moiety may be carbonyl or a heteroatom moiety as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As above for the Y rings, within any single conductive oligomer, the B-D bonds (or D moieties, when g&equals;0) may be all the same, or at least one may be different. For example, when m is zero, the terminal B-D bond may be an amide bond, and the rest of the B-D bonds may be acetylene bonds. Generally, when amide bonds are present, as few amide bonds as possible are preferable, but in some embodiments all the B-D bonds are amide bonds. Thus, as outlined above for the Y rings, one type of B-D bond may be present in the conductive oligomer within a monolayer as described below, and another type above the monolayer level, to give greater flexibility for nucleic acid hybridization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the structures depicted herein, n is an integer from 1 to 50, although longer oligomers may also be used (see for example Schumm et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994 33(13):1360). Without being bound by theory, it appears that for efficient hybridization of nucleic acids on a surface, the hybridization should occur at a distance from the surface, i.e. the kinetics of hybridization increase as a function of the distance from the surface, particularly for long oligonucleotides of 200 to 300 basepairs. Accordingly, the length of the conductive oligomer is such that the closest nucleotide of the nucleic acid is positioned from about 6 &angst; to about 100 &angst; (although distances of up to 500 &angst; may be used) from the electrode surface, with from about 25 &angst; to about 60 &angst; being preferred. Accordingly, n will depend on the size of the aromatic group, but generally will be from about 1 to about 20, with from about 2 to about 15 being preferred and from about 3 to about 10 being especially preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In the structures depicted herein, m is either 0 or 1. That is, when m is 0, the conductive oligomer may terminate in the B-D bond or D moiety, i.e. the D atom is attached to the nucleic acid either directly or via a linker. In some embodiments, for example when the conductive oligomer is attached to a phosphate of the ribose-phosphate backbone of a nucleic acid, there may be additional atoms, such as a linker, attached between the conductive oligomer and the nucleic acid. Additionally, as outlined below, the D atom may be the nitrogen atom of the amino-modified ribose. Alternatively, when m is 1, the conductive oligomer may terminate in Y, an aromatic group, i.e. the aromatic group is attached to the nucleic acid or linker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those in the art, a large number of possible conductive oligomers may be utilized.

The G bond of each subunit may be the same or different than the G bonds of other subunits; that is, alternating oligomers of alkene and acetylene bonds could be used, etc. However, when G is an alkane bond, the number of alkane bonds in the oligomer should be kept to a minimum, with about six or less sigma bonds per conductive oligomer being preferred.

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The alkene oligomer of structure 10, and others depicted herein, are generally depicted in the preferred trans configuration, although oligomers of cis or mixtures of trans and cis may also be used. As above, R groups may be added to alter the packing of the compositions on an electrode, the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the oligomer, and the flexibility, i.e. the rotational, torsional or longitudinal flexibility of the oligomer. n is as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, R is hydrogen, although R may be also alkyl groups and polyethylene glycols or derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the conductive oligomer may be a mixture of different types of oligomers, for example of structures 2 and 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The conductive oligomers are covalently attached to the nucleic acids. By &ldquo;covalently attached&rdquo; herein is meant that two moieties are attached by at least one bond, including sigma bonds, pi bonds and coordination bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid is covalently attached to the conductive oligomer, and the conductive oligomer is also covalently attached to the electrode. In general, the covalent attachments are done in such a manner as to minimize the amount of unconjugated sigma bonds an electron must travel from the electron donor to the electron acceptor. Thus, linkers are generally short, or contain conjugated bonds with few sigma bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The covalent attachment of the nucleic acid and the conductive oligomer may be accomplished in several ways. In a preferred embodiment, the attachment is via attachment to the base of the nucleoside, via attachment to the backbone of the nucleic acid (either the ribose, the phosphate, or to an analogous group of a nucleic acid analog backbone), or via a transition metal ligand, as described below. The techniques outlined below are generally described for naturally occuring nucleic acids, although as will be appreciated by those in the art, similar techniques may be used with nucleic acid analogs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the conductive oligomer is attached to the base of a nucleoside of the nucleic acid. This may be done in several ways, depending on the oligomer, as is described below. In one embodiment, the oligomer is attached to a terminal nucleoside, i.e. either the 3&prime; or 5&prime; nucleoside of the nucleic acid. Alternatively, the conductive oligomer is attached to an internal nucleoside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The point of attachment to the base will vary with the base. While attachment at any position is possible, it is preferred to attach at positions not involved in hydrogen bonding to the complementary base. Thus, for example, generally attachment is to the 5 or 6 position of pyrimidines such as uridine, cytosine and thymine. For purines such as adenine and guanine, the linkage is preferably via the 8 position. Attachment to non-standard bases is preferably done at the comparable positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the attachment is direct; that is, there are no intervening atoms between the conductive oligomer and the base. In this embodiment, for example, conductive oligomers with terminal acetylene bonds are attached directly to the base. Structure 11 is an example of this linkage, using a Structure 4 conductive oligomer and uridine as the base, although other bases and conductive oligomers can be used as will be appreciated by those in the art:

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the attachment is through an amide bond using a linker as needed, as is generally depicted in Structure 12 using uridine as the base and a Structure 4 oligomer:

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The amide attachment can also be done using an amino group of the base, either a naturally occurring amino group such as in cytidine or adenidine, or from an amino-modified base as are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, Z is a linker. Preferably, Z is a short linker of about 1 to about 5 atoms, that may or may not contain alkene bonds. Linkers are known in the art; for example, homo-or hetero-bifunctional linkers as are well known (see 1994 Pierce Chemical Company catalog, technical section on cross-linkers, pages 155-200, incorporated herein by reference). Preferred Z linkers include, but are not limited to, alkyl groups and alkyl groups containing heteroatom moieties, with short alkyl groups, esters, epoxy groups and ethylene glycol and derivatives being preferred, with propyl, acetylene, and C<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>alkene being especially preferred. Z may also be a sulfone group, forming sulfonamide linkages as discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the attachment of the nucleic acid and the conductive oligomer is done via attachment to the backbone of the nucleic acid. This may be done in a number of ways, including attachment to a ribose of the ribose-phosphate backbone, or to the phosphate of the backbone, or other groups of analogous backbones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> As a preliminary matter, it should be understood that the site of attachment in this embodiment may be to a 3&prime; or 5&prime; terminal nucleotide, or to an internal nucleotide, as is more fully described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the conductive oligomer is attached to the ribose of the ribose-phosphate backbone. This may be done in several ways. As is known in the art, nucleosides that are modified at either the 2&prime; or 3&prime; position of the ribose with amino groups, sulfur groups, silicone groups, phosphorus groups, or oxo groups can be made (Imazawa et al., J. Org. Chem., 44:2039 (1979); Hobbs et al., J. Org. Chem. 42(4):714 (1977); Verheyden et al., J. Orrg. Chem. 36(2):250 (1971); McGee et al., J. Org. Chem. 61:781-785 (1996); Mikhailopulo et al., Liebigs. Ann. Chem. 513-519 (1993); McGee et al., Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides 14(6):1329 (1995), all of which are incorporated by reference). These modified nucleosides are then used to add the conductive oligomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment utilizes amino-modified nucleosides. These amino-modified riboses can then be used to form either amide or amine linkages to the conductive oligomers. In a preferred embodiment, the amino group is attached directly to the ribose, although as will be appreciated by those in the art, short linkers such as those described herein for &ldquo;Z&rdquo; may be present between the amino group and the ribose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, an amide linkage is used for attachment to the ribose. Preferably, if the conductive oligomer of Structures 2-4 is used, m is zero and thus the conductive oligomer terminates in the amide bond. In this embodiment, the nitrogen of the amino group of the amino-modified ribose is the &ldquo;D&rdquo; atom of the conductive oligomer. Thus, a preferred attachment of this embodiment is depicted in Structure 13 (using the Structure 4 conductive oligomer):

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a heteroatom linkage is used, i.e. oxo, amine, sulfur, etc. A preferred embodiment utilizes an amine linkage. Again, as outlined above for the amide linkages, for amine linkages, the nitrogen of the amino-modified ribose may be the &ldquo;D&rdquo; atom of the conductive oligomer when the Structure 4 conductive oligomer is used. Thus, for example, Structures 14 and 15 depict nucleosides with the Structures 4 and 10 conductive oligomers, respectively, using the nitrogen as the heteroatom, although other heteroatoms can be used:

<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In the structures depicted herein, M is a metal atom, with transition metals being preferred. Suitable transition metals for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), palladium (Pd), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), osmium (Os), rhenium (Re), platinium (Pt), scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), Vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), Molybdenum (Mo), technetium (Tc), tungsten (W), and iridium (Ir). That is, the first series of transition metals, the platinum metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt), along with Fe, Re, W, Mo and Tc, are preferred. Particularly preferred are ruthenium, rhenium, osmium, platinium, cobalt and iron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> L are the co-ligands, that provide the coordination atoms for the binding of the metal ion. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the number and nature of the co-ligands will depend on the coordination number of the metal ion. Mono-, di- or polydentate co-ligands may be used at any position. Thus, for example, when the metal has a coordination number of six, the L from the terminus of the conductive oligomer, the L contributed from the nucleic acid, and r, add up to six. Thus, when the metal has a coordination number of six, r may range from zero (when all coordination atoms are provided by the other two ligands) to four, when all the co-ligands are monodentate. Thus generally, r will be from 0 to 8, depending on the coordination number of the metal ion and the choice of the other ligands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the metal ion has a coordination number of six and both the ligand attached to the conductive oligomer and the ligand attached to the nucleic acid are at least bidentate; that is, r is preferably zero, one (i.e. the remaining co-ligand is bidentate) or two (two monodentate co-ligands are used). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated in the art, the co-ligands can be the same or different. Suitable ligands fall into two categories: ligands which use nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, carbon or phosphorus atoms (depending on the metal ion) as the coordination atoms (generally referred to in the literature as sigma (&sgr;) donors) and organometallic ligands such as metallocene ligands (generally referred to in the literature as pi (&pgr;) donors, and depicted herein as L<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>). Suitable nitrogen donating ligands are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; NHR; NRR&prime;; pyridine; pyrazine; isonicotinamide; imidazole; bipyridine and substituted derivatives of bipyridine; terpyridine and substituted derivatives; phenanthrolines, particularly 1,10-phenanthroline (abbreviated phen) and substituted derivatives of phenanthrolines such as 4,7-dimethylphenanthroline and dipyridol&lsqb;3,2-a:2&prime;,3&prime;-c&rsqb;phenazine (abbreviated dppz); dipyridophenazine; 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene (abbreviated hat); 9,10-phenanthrenequinone diimine (abbreviated phi); 1,4,5,8-tetraazaphenanthrene (abbreviated tap); 1,4,8,11-tetra-azacyclotetradecane (abbreviated cyclam) and isocyanide. Substituted derivatives, including fused derivatives, may also be used. In some embodiments, porphyrins and substituted derivatives of the porphyrin family may be used. See for example, Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry, Ed. Wilkinson et al., Pergammon Press, 1987, Chapters 13.2 (pp73-98), 21.1 (pp. 813-898) and 21.3 (pp 915-957), all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Suitable sigma donating ligands using carbon, oxygen, sulfur and phosphorus are known in the art. For example, suitable sigma carbon donors are found in Cotton and Wilkenson, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1988, hereby incorporated by reference; see page 38, for example. Similarly, suitable oxygen ligands include crown ethers, water and others known in the art. Phosphines and substituted phosphines are also suitable; see page 38 of Cotton and Wilkenson. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus and nitrogen-donating ligands are attached in such a manner as to allow the heteroatoms to serve as coordination atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, organometallic ligands are used. In addition to purely organic compounds for use as redox moieties, and various transition metal coordination complexes with &dgr;-bonded organic ligand with donor atoms as heterocyclic or exocyclic substituents, there is available a wide variety of transition metal organometallic compounds with &pgr;-bonded organic ligands (see Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, 5th Ed., Cotton &amp; Wilkinson, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1988, chapter 26; Organometallics, A Concise Introduction, Elschenbroich et al., 2nd Ed., 1992, VCH; and Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry II, A Review of the Literature 1982-1994, Abel et al. Ed., Vol. 7, chapters 7, 8, 10 &amp; 11, Pergamon Press, hereby expressly incorporated by reference). Such organometallic ligands include cyclic aromatic compounds such as the cyclopentadienide ion &lsqb;C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>(&minus;1)&rsqb; and various ring substituted and ring fused derivatives, such as the indenylide (&minus;1) ion, that yield a class of bis(cyclopentadieyl)metal compounds, (i.e. the metallocenes); see for example Robins et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 104:1882-1893 (1982); and Gassman et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108:4228-4229 (1986), incorporated by reference. Of these, ferrocene &lsqb;(C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Fe&rsqb; and its derivatives are prototypical examples which have been used in a wide variety of chemical (Connelly et al., Chem. 25 Rev. 96:877-910 (1996), incorporated by reference) and electrochemical (Geiger et al., Advances in Organometallic Chemistry 23:1-93; and Geiger et al., Advances in Organometallic Chemistry 24:87, incorporated by reference) electron transfer or &ldquo;redox&rdquo; reactions. Metallocene derivatives of a variety of the first, second and third row transition metals are potential candidates as redox moieties that are covalently attached to either the ribose ring or the nucleoside base of nucleic acid. Other potentially suitable organometallic ligands include cyclic arenes such as benzene, to yield bis(arene)metal compounds and their ring substituted and ring fused derivatives, of which bis(benzene)chromium is a prototypical example, Other acyclic &pgr;-bonded ligands such as the allyl(&minus;1) ion, or butadiene yield potentially suitable organometallic compounds, and all such ligands, in conduction with other &pgr;-bonded and &dgr;-bonded ligands constitute the general class of organometallic compounds in which there is a metal to carbon bond. Electrochemical studies of various dimers and oligomers of such compounds with bridging organic ligands, and additional non-bridging ligands, as well as with and without metal-metal bonds are potential candidate redox moieties in nucleic acid analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> When one or more of the co-ligands is an organometallic ligand, the ligand is generally attached via one of the carbon atoms of the organometallic ligand, although attachment may be via other atoms for heterocyclic ligands. Preferred organometallic ligands include metallocene ligands, including substituted derivatives and the metalloceneophanes (see page 1174 of Cotton and Wilkenson, supra). For example, derivatives of metallocene ligands such as methylcyclopentadienyl, with multiple methyl groups being preferred, such as pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, can be used to increase the stability of the metallocene. In a preferred embodiment, only one of the two metallocene ligands of a metallocene are derivatized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> As described herein, any combination of ligands may be used. Preferred combinations include: a) all ligands are nitrogen donating ligands; b) all ligands are organometallic ligands; and c) the ligand at the terminus of the conductive oligomer is a metallocene ligand and the ligand provided by the nucleic acid is a nitrogen donating ligand, with the other ligands, if needed, are either nitrogen donating ligands or metallocene ligands, or a mixture. These combinations are depicted in representative structures using the conductive oligomer of Structure 4 are depicted in Structures 20 (using phenanthroline and amino as representative ligands), 21 (using ferrocene as the metal-ligand combination) and 22 (using cyclopentadienyl and amino as representative ligands).

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the ligands used in the invention show altered fluoroscent properties depending on the redox state of the chelated metal ion. As described below, this thus serves as an additional mode of detection of electron transfer through nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, as is described more fully below, the ligand attached to the nucleic acid is an amino group attached to the 2&prime; or 3&prime; position of a ribose of the ribose-phosphate backbone. This ligand may contain a multiplicity of amino groups so as to form a polydentate ligand which binds the metal ion. Other preferred ligands include cyclopentadiene and phenanthroline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> As described herein, the compositions described herein of nucleosides covalently attached to conductive oligomers may be incorporated into a longer nucleic acid at any number of positions, including either the 5&prime; or 3&prime; terminus of the nucleic acid or any internal position. As is outlined below, this is generally done by adding a nucleotide with a covalently attached conductive oligomer to an oligonucleotide synthetic reaction at any position. After synthesis is complete, the nucleic acid with the covalently attached conductive oligomer is attached to an electrode. Thus, any number of additional nucleotides, modified or not, may be included at any position. Alternatively, the compositions are made via post-nucleic acid synthesis modifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The total length of the nucleic acid will depend on its use. Generally, the nucleic acid compositions of the invention are useful as oligonucleotide probes. As is appreciated by those in the art, the length of the probe will vary with the length of the target sequence and the hybridization and wash conditions. Generally, oligonucleotide probes range from about 8 to about 50 nucleotides, with from about 10 to about 30 being preferred and from about 12 to about 25 being especially preferred. In some cases, very long probes may be used, e.g. 50 to 200-300 nucleotides in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Also of consideration is the distance between the nucleoside containing the electrode, i.e. a first electron transfer moiety, and the nucleoside containing a second electron transfer moiety. Electron transfer proceeds between the two electron transfer moieties. Since the rate of electron transfer is distance dependent, the distance between the two electron transfer moieties preferably ranges from about 1 to about 30 basepairs, with from about 2 to about 20 basepairs being preferred and from about 2 to about 10 basepairs being particularly preferred and from about 2 to 6 being especially preferred. However, probe specificity can be increased by adding oligonucleotides on either side of the electron transfer moieties, thus increasing probe specificity without increasing the distance an electron must travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the structures depicted herein, nucleosides may be replaced with nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the conductive oligomers with covalently attached nucleosides or nucleic acids as depicted herein are covalently attached to an electrode. Thus, one end or terminus of the conductive oligomer is attached to the nucleoside or nucleic acid, and the other is attached to an electrode. In some embodiments it may be desirable to have the conductive oligomer attached at a position other than a terminus, or even to have a branched conductive oligomer that is attached to an electrode at one terminus and to two or more nucleosides at other termini, although this is not preferred. Similarly, the conductive oligomer may be attached at two sites to the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;electrode&rdquo; herein is meant a composition, which, when connected to an electronic device, is able to sense a current or charge and convert it to a signal. Thus, an electrode is an electron transfer moiety as described herein. Preferred electodes are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, certain metals and their oxides, including gold; platinum; palladium; silicon; aluminum; metal oxide electrodes including platinum oxide, titanium oxide, tin oxide, indium tin oxide, palladium oxide, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, molybdenum oxide (Mo<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>), tungsten oxide (WO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and ruthenium oxides; and carbon (including glassy carbon electrodes, graphite and carbon paste). Preferred electrodes include gold, silicon, carbon and metal oxide electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The electrodes described herein are depicted as a flat surface, which is only one of the possible conformations of the electrode and is for schematic purposes only. The conformation of the electrode will vary with the detection method used. For example, flat planar electrodes may be preferred for optical detection methods, or when arrays of nucleic acids are made, thus requiring addressable locations for both synthesis and detection. Alternatively, for single probe analysis, the electrode may be in the form of a tube, with the conductive oligomers and nucleic acids bound to the inner surface. This allows a maximum of surface area containing the nucleic acids to be exposed to a small volume of sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The covalent attachment of the conductive oligomer containing the nucleoside may be accomplished in a variety of ways, depending on the electrode and the conductive oligomer used. Generally, some type of linker is used, as depicted below as &ldquo;A&rdquo; in Structure 23, where X is the conductive oligomer, and the hatched surface is the electrode:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, A is a linker or atom. The choice of &ldquo;A&rdquo; will depend in part on the characteristics of the electrode. Thus, for example, A may be a sulfur moiety when a gold electrode is used. Alternatively, when metal oxide electrodes are used, A may be a silicon (silane) moiety attached to the oxygen of the oxide (see for example Chen et al., Langmuir 10:3332-3337 (1994); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Lenhard et al., J. Electroanal. Chem. 78:195-201 (1977), both of which are expressly incorporated by reference). When carbon based electrodes are used, A may be an amino moiety (preferably a primary amine; see for example Deinhammer et al., Langmuir 10:1306-1313 (1994)). Thus, preferred A moieties include, but are not limited to, silane moieties, sulfur moieties (including alkyl sulfur moieties), and amino moieties. In a preferred embodiment, epoxide type linkages with redox polymers such as are known in the art are not used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Although depicted herein as a single moiety, the conductive oligomer may be attached to the electrode with more than one &ldquo;A&rdquo; moiety; the &ldquo;A&rdquo; moieties may be the same or different. Thus, for example, when the electrode is a gold electrode, and &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a sulfur atom or moiety, such as generally depicted below in Structure 27, multiple sulfur atoms may be used to attach the conductive oligomer to the electrode, such as is generally depicted below in Structures 24, 25 and 26. As will be appreciated by those in the art, other such structures can be made. In Structures 24, 25 and 26, the A moiety is just a sulfur atom, but substituted sulfur moieties may also be used.

<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the electrode is a gold electrode, and attachment is via a sulfur linkage as is well known in the art, i.e. the A moiety is a sulfur atom or moiety.

A representative structure is depicted in Structure 27. Structure 27 depicts the &ldquo;A&rdquo; linker as comprising just a sulfur atom, although additional atoms may be present (i.e. linkers from the sulfur to the conductive oligomer or substitution groups).

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In Structure 29, the oxygen atom is from the oxide of the metal oxide electrode. The Si atom may also contain other atoms, i.e. be a silicon moiety containing substitution groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Thus, in a preferred embodiment, electrodes are made that comprise conductive oligomers attached to nucleic acids for the purposes of hybridization assays, as is more fully described herein. As will be appreciated by those in the art, electrodes can be made that have a single species of nucleic acid, i.e. a single nucleic acid sequence, or multiple nucleic acid species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In addition, as outlined herein, the use of a solid support such as an electrode enables the use of these gene probes in an array form. The use of oligonucleotide arrays are well known in the art. In addition, techniques are known for &ldquo;addressing&rdquo; locations within an electrode and for the surface modification of electrodes. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, arrays of different nucleic acids are laid down on the electrode, each of which are covalently attached to the electrode via a conductive linker. In this embodiment, the number of different probe species of oligonucleotides may vary widely, from one to thousands, with from about 4 to about 100,000 being preferred, and from about 10 to about 10,000 being particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the electrode further comprises a passavation agent, preferably in the form of a monolayer on the electrode surface. As outlined above, the efficiency of oligonucleotide hybridization may increase when the oligonucleotide is at a distance from the electrode. A passavation agent layer facilitates the maintenance of the nucleic acid away from the electrode surface. In addition, a passavation agent serves to keep charge carriers away from the surface of the electrode. Thus, this layer helps to prevent electrical contact between the electrodes and the electron transfer moieties, or between the electrode and charged species within the solvent. Such contact can result in a direct &ldquo;short circuit&rdquo; or an indirect short circuit via charged species which may be present in the sample. Accordingly, the monolayer of passavation agents is preferably tightly packed in a uniform layer on the electrode surface, such that a minimum of &ldquo;holes&rdquo; exist. Alternatively, the passavation agent may not be in the form of a monolayer, but may be present to help the packing of the conductive oligomers or other characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The passavation agents thus serve as a physical barrier to block solvent accesibility to the electrode. As such, the passavation agents themselves may in fact be either (1) conducting or (2) nonconducting, i.e. insulating, molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Thus, in one embodiment, the passavation agents are conductive oligomers, as described herein, with or without a terminal group to block or decrease the transfer of charge to the electrode. Other passavation agents which may be conductive include oligomers of &mdash;(CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;, &mdash;(CHF)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash; and &mdash;(CFR)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;. In a preferred embodiment, the passavation agents are insulator moieties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;insulator&rdquo; is a substantially nonconducting oligomer, preferably linear. By &ldquo;substantially nonconducting&rdquo; herein is meant that the rate of electron transfer through the insulator is slower than the rate of electron transfer through the stacked &pgr;-orbitals of double stranded nucleic acid. Stated differently, the electrical resistance of the insulator is higher than the electrical resistance of the nucleic acid. In a preferred embodiment, the rate of electron transfer through the insulator is slower than or comparable to the rate through single stranded nucleic acid. Similarly, the rate of electron transfer through the insulator is preferrably slower than the rate through the conductive oligomers described herein. It should be noted however, as outlined in the Examples, that even oligomers generally considered to be insulators, such as &mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>16 </subscript></highlight>molecules, still may transfer electrons, albeit at a slow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the insulators have a conductivity, S, of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>or lower, with less than about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>being preferred. See generally Gardner et al., supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Generally, insulators are alkyl or heteroalkyl oligomers or moieties with sigma bonds, although any particular insulator molecule may contain aromatic groups or one or more conjugated bonds. By &ldquo;heteroalkyl&rdquo; herein is meant an alkyl group that has at least one heteroatom, i.e. nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, silicon or boron included in the chain. Alternatively, the insulator may be quite similar to a conductive oligomer with the addition of one or more heteroatoms or bonds that serve to inhibit or slow, preferably substantially, electron transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The passavation agents, including insulators, may be substituted with R groups as defined herein to alter the packing of the moieties or conductive oligomers on an electrode, the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the insulator, and the flexibility, i.e. the rotational, torsional or longitudinal flexibility of the insulator. For example, branched alkyl groups may be used. In addition, the terminus of the passavation agent, including insulators, may contain an additional group to influence the exposed surface of the monolayer. For example, there may be negatively charged groups on the terminus to form a negatively charged surface such that when the nucleic acid is DNA or RNA the nucleic acid is repelled or prevented from lying down on the surface, to facilitate hybridization. Preferred passavation agent terminal groups include&mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, &mdash;OH, &mdash;COOH, and &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The length of the passavation agent will vary as needed. As outlined above, it appears that hybridization is more efficient at a distance from the surface. Thus, the length of the passavation agents is similar to the length of the conductive oligomers, as outlined above. In addition, the conductive oligomers may be basically the same length as the passavation agents or longer than them, resulting in the nucleic acids being more accessible to the solvent for hybridization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The monolayer may comprise a single type of passavation agent, including insulators, or different types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Suitable insulators are known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, &mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;, &mdash;(CRH)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;, and &mdash;(CR<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&mdash;, ethylene glycol or derivatives using other heteroatoms in place of oxygen, i.e. nitrogen or sulfur (sulfur derivatives are not preferred when the electrode is gold). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The passavation agents are generally attached to the electrode in the same manner as the conductive oligomer, and may use the same &ldquo;A&rdquo; linker as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the compositions of the present invention comprise a conductive oligomer, covalently attached to both an electrode, which serves as a first electron transfer moiety, and a nucleic acid. In this embodiment, the conductive oligomer preferably has the structure depicted in Structures 2, 3, 4, 9 or 10. In this embodiment, the compositions find use in general array-type technologies, i.e. the electrode may serve just as a solid support, with detection proceeding using techniques well known in the art, such as fluorescence or radioisotope labelling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, it is possible to have each nucleic acid be the same, as an &ldquo;anchor sequence&rdquo;, such that a second sequence can be added which contains the probe sequence and a sequence complementary to the anchor sequence. In this way, standard arrays of different anchor sequences can be made, which then can be used to generate custom arrays using novel probe sequences linked to complementary anchor regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Similarly, it is possible to have compositions comprising electrodes with conductive oligomers attached to probe nucleic acids, without second electron transfer moieties, and soluble second probe sequences with second electron transfer moieties. Upon binding of the target sequence, which contains a first target domain for the first probe sequence and a second target domain for the second probe sequence, which preferably are adjacent, electron transfer may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it may be the target sequence which contains the second electron transfer moiety. Similar to methods which rely on amplification and labelling of target sequences, the target nucleic acid may be labelled with a second electron transfer moiety which then can be used to effect electron transfer upon formation of the hybridization complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the compositions of the present invention comprise a conductive oligomer, covalently attached to both an electrode, which serves as a first electron transfer moiety, and a nucleic acid, which has at least a second covalently attached electron transfer moiety. As noted herein, the conductive oligomer and the second electron transfer moiety may be attached at any position of the nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a nucleic acid is modified with more than two electron transfer moieties. For example, to increase the signal obtained from the probe, or alter the required detector sensitivity, a plurality of electron transfer moieties may be used. See PCT publication WO 95/15971. For example, the conductive oligomer may be attached to an internal nucleoside, with second electron transfer moieties (ETM) attached both 5&prime; and 3&prime; to the nucleoside containing the conductive oligomer, as is generally depicted in Structure 29A. In one embodiment, the two additional electron transfer moieties are the same, and are placed the same distance away from the conductive oligomer, to result in a uniform signal. Alternatively, the additional electron transfer moieties may be different and/or placed at different distances from the conductive oligomer.

<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;electron donor moiety&rdquo;, &ldquo;electron acceptor moiety&rdquo;, and &ldquo;electron transfer moieties&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein refers to molecules capable of electron transfer under certain conditions. It is to be understood that electron donor and acceptor capabilities are relative; that is, a molecule which can lose an electron under certain experimental conditions will be able to accept an electron under different experimental conditions. It is to be understood that the number of possible electron donor moieties and electron acceptor moieties is very large, and that one skilled in the art of electron transfer compounds will be able to utilize a number of compounds in the present invention. Preferred electron transfer moieties include, but are not limited to, transition metal complexes, organic electron transfer moieties, and electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the electron transfer moieties are transition metal complexes. Transition metals are those whose atoms have a partial or complete d shell of electrons. Suitable transition metals for use in the invention are listed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The transition metals are complexed with a variety of ligands, L, defined above, to form suitable transition metal complexes, as is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In addition to transition metal complexes, other organic electron donors and acceptors may be covalently attached to the nucleic acid for use in the invention. These organic molecules include, but are not limited to, riboflavin, xanthene dyes, azine dyes, acridine orange, N,N&prime;-dimethyl-2,7-diazapyrenium dichloride (DAP<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>), methylviologen, ethidium bromide, quinones such as N,N&prime;-dimethylanthra(2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d&prime;e&prime;y&prime;)diisoquinoline dichloride (ADIQ<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>); porphyrins (&lsqb;meso-tetrakis(N-methyl-x-pyridinium)porphyrin tetrachloride&rsqb;, varlamine blue B hydrochloride, Bindschedler&apos;s green; 2,6-dichloroindophenol, 2,6-dibromophenolindophenol; Brilliant crest blue (3-amino-9-dimethyl-amino-10-methylphenoxyazine chloride), methylene blue; Nile blue A (aminoaphthodiethylaminophenoxazine sulfate), indigo-5,5&prime;,7,7&prime;-tetrasulfonic acid, indigo-5,5&prime;,7-trisulfonic acid; phenosafranine, indigo-5-monosulfonic acid; safranine T; bis(dimethylglyoximato)-iron(II) chloride; induline scarlet, neutral red, anthracene, coronene, pyrene, 9-phenylanthracene, rubrene, binaphthyl, DPA, phenothiazene, fluoranthene, phenanthrene, chrysene, 1,8-diphenyl-1,3,5,7-octatetracene, naphthalene, acenaphthalene, perylene, TMPD and analogs and subsitituted derivatives of these compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the electron donors and acceptors are redox proteins as are known in the art. However, redox proteins in many embodiments are not preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The choice of the specific electron transfer moieties will be influenced by the type of electron transfer detection used, as is generally outlined below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, these electron transfer moieties are covalently attached to the nucleic acid in a variety of positions. In a preferred embodiment, the attachment is via attachment to the base of the nucleoside, or via attachment to the backbone of the nucleic acid, including either to a ribose of the ribose-phosphate backbone or to a phosphate moiety. In the preferred embodiments, the compositions of the invention are designed such that the electron transfer moieties are as close to the &ldquo;&pgr;-way&rdquo; as possible without significantly disturbing the secondary and tertiary structure of the double helical nucleic acid, particularly the Watson-Crick basepairing. Alternatively, the attachment can be via a conductive oligomer, which is used as outlined above with a nucleoside and an electrode; that is, an electron transfer moiety may be covalently attached to a conductive oligomer at one end and to a nucleoside at the other, thus forming a general structure depicted in Structure 30:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In Structure 30, ETM is an electron transfer moiety, X is a conductive oligomer, and q is an integer from zero to about 25, with preferred q being from about 2 to about 10. Additionally, linker moieties, for example as are generally described herein as &ldquo;Z&rdquo;, may also be present between the nucleoside and the conductive oligomer, and/or between the conductive oligomer and the electron transfer moiety. The depicted nucleosides may be either terminal or internal nucleosides, and are usually separated by a number of nucleosides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the second electron transfer moiety is attached to the base of a nucleoside, as is generally outlined above for attachment of the conductive oligomer. This is preferably done to the base of an internal nucleoside. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, this attachment does not perturb the Watson-Crick basepairing of the base to which the electron transfer moiety is attached, as long as the moiety is not too large. In fact, it appears that attachment at this site actually results in less perturbation than attachment at the ribose of the ribose-phosphate backbone, as measured by nucleic acid melting curves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Thus, when attachment to an internal base is done, the size of the second electron transfer moiety should be such that the structure of double stranded nucleic acid containing the base-attached electron transfer moiety is not significantly disrupted, and will not disrupt the annealing of single stranded nucleic acids. Preferrably, then, ligands and full second electron transfer moieties are generally smaller than the size of the major groove of double stranded nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the second electron transfer moiety can be attached to the base of a terminal nucleoside. Thus, when the target sequence to be detected is n nucleosides long, a probe can be made which has the second electron transfer moiety attached at the n base. Alternatively, the probe may contain an extra terminal nucleoside at an end of the nucleic acid (n&plus;1 or n&plus;2), which are used to covalently attach the electron transfer moieties but which do not participate in basepair hybridization. Additionally, it is preferred that upon probe hybridization, the terminal nucleoside containing the electron transfer moiety covalently attached at the base be directly adjacent to Watson-Crick basepaired nucleosides; that is, the electron transfer moiety should be as close as possible to the stacked &pgr;-orbitals of the bases such that an electron travels through a minimum of &sgr; bonds to reach the &ldquo;&pgr;-way&rdquo;, or alternatively can otherwise electronically contact the &pgr;-way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The covalent attachment to the base will depend in part on the second electron transfer moiety chosen, but in general is similar to the attachment of conductive oligomers to bases, as outlined above. In a preferred embodiment, the second electron transfer moiety is a transition metal complex, and thus attachment of a suitable metal ligand to the base leads to the covalent attachment of the electron transfer moiety. Alternatively, similar types of linkages may be used for the attachment of organic electron transfer moieties, as will be appreciated by those in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the C4 attached amino group of cytosine, the C6 attached amino group of adenine, or the C2 attached amino group of guanine may be used as a transition metal ligand, although in this embodiment attachment at a terminal base is preferred since attachment at these positions will perturb Watson-Crick basepairing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Ligands containing aromatic groups can be attached via acetylene linkages as is known in the art (see Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Trost et al., Ed., Pergamon Press, Chapter 2.4: Coupling Reactions Between Sp<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and sp Carbon Centers, Sonogashira, pp521-549, and pp950-953, hereby incorporated by reference).

As is known in the art, nucleosides that are modified at either the 2&prime; or 3&prime; position of the ribose can be made, with nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and phosphorus-containing modifications possible. Amino-modified ribose is preferred. See generally PCT publication WO 95/15971, incorporated herein by reference. These modification groups may be used as a transition metal ligand, or as a chemically functional moiety for attachment of other transition metal ligands and organometallic ligands, or organic electron donor moieties as will be appreciated by those in the art. In this embodiment, a linker such as depicted herein for &ldquo;Z&rdquo; may be used as well, or a conductive oligomer between the ribose and the electron transfer moiety. Preferred embodiments utilize attachment at the 2&prime; or 3&prime; position of the ribose, with the 2&prime; position being preferred.

<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> second moiety at the 5&prime; terminus, electrode at an internal position; both electrode and second moiety at internal positions; electrode at an internal position, second moiety at the 3&prime; terminus, etc. A preferred embodiment utilizes both the electrode and the second electron transfer moiety attached to internal nucleosides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the invention may additionally contain one or more labels at any position. By &ldquo;label&rdquo; herein is meant an element (e.g. an isotope) or chemical compound that is attached to enable the detection of the compound. Preferred labels are radioactive isotopic labels, and colored or fluorescent dyes. The labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position. In addition, the compositions of the invention may also contain other moieties such as cross-linking agents to facilitate cross-linking of the target-probe complex. See for example, Lukhtanov et al., Nucl. Acids. Res. 24(4):683 (1996) and Tabone et al., Biochem. 33:375 (1994), both of which are expressly incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the invention are generally synthesized as outlined below, generally utilizing techniques well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The compositions may be made in several ways. A preferred method first synthesizes a conductive oligomer attached to the nucleoside, with addition of additional nucleosides followed by attachment to the electrode. A second electron transfer moiety, if present, may be added prior to attachment to the electrode or after. Alternatively, the whole nucleic acid may be made and then the completed conductive oligomer added, followed by attachment to the electrode. Alternatively, the conductive oligomer and monolayer (if present) are attached to the electrode first, followed by attachment of the nucleic acid. The latter two methods may be preferred when conductive oligomers are used which are not stable in the solvents and under the conditions used in traditional nucleic acid synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the compositions of the invention are made by first forming the conductive oligomer covalently attached to the nucleoside, followed by the addition of additional nucleosides to form a nucleic acid, including, if present, a nucleoside containing a second electron transfer moiety, with the last step comprising the addition of the conductive oligomer to the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The attachment of the conductive oligomer to the nucleoside may be done in several ways. In a preferred embodiment, all or part of the conductive oligomer is synthesized first (generally with a functional group on the end for attachment to the electrode), which is then attached to the nucleoside. Additional nucleosides are then added as required, with the last step generally being attachment to the electrode. Alternatively, oligomer units are added one at a time to the nucleoside, with addition of additional nucleosides and attachment to the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> A general outline of a preferred embodiment is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, using a phenyl-acetylene oligomer as generally depicted in Structure 5. Other conductive oligomers will be made using similar techniques, such as heterooligomers, or as known in the art. Thus, for example, conductive oligomers using alkene or acetylene bonds are made as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The conductive oligomer is then attached to a nucleoside that may contain one (or more) of the oligomer units, attached as depicted herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, attachment is to a ribose of the ribose-phosphate backbone. Thus, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts attachment via an amide linkage, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 16</cross-reference> depict the synthesis of compounds with amine linkages. In a preferred embodiment, there is at least a methylene group or other short aliphatic alkyl groups (as a Z group) between the nitrogen attached to the ribose and the aromatic ring of the conductive oligomer. A representative synthesis is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, attachment is via a phosphate of the ribose-phosphate backbone. Examples of two synthetic schemes are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (synthesis of Structure 16 type compounds) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (synthesis of Structure 16 type compounds). Although both Figures show attachment at the 3&prime; position of the ribose, attachment can also be made via the 2&prime; position. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, Z</cross-reference> is an ethylene linker, although other linkers may be used as well, as will be appreciated by those in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, attachment is via the base. A general scheme is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, using uridine as the nucleoside and a phenylene-acetylene conductive oligomer. As will be appreciated in the art, amide linkages are also possible, such as depicted in Structure 12, using techniques well known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, protecting groups may be added to the base prior to addition of the conductive oligomers, as is generally outlined in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>. In addition, the palladium cross-coupling reactions may be altered to prevent dimerization problems; i.e. two conductive oligomers dimerizing, rather than coupling to the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, attachment to the base may be done by making the nucleoside with one unit of the oligomer, followed by the addition of others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Once the modified nucleosides are prepared, protected and activated, prior to attachment to the electrode, they may be incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide by standard synthetic techniques (Gait, Oligonucleotide Synthesis: A Practical Approach, IRL Press, Oxford, UK 1984; Eckstein) in several ways. In one embodiment, one or more modified nucleosides are converted to the triphosphate form and incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide chain by using standard molecular biology techniques such as with the use of the enzyme DNA polymerase I, T4 DNA polymerase, T7 DNA polymerase, Taq DNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase, and RNA polymerases. For the incorporation of a 3&prime; modified nucleoside to a nucleic acid, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase may be used. (Ratliff, Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. In The Enzymes, Vol 14A. P.D. Boyer ed. pp 105-118. Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. 1981). Alternatively, and preferably, the amino nucleoside is converted to the phosphoramidite or H-phosphonate form, which are then used in solid-phase or solution syntheses of oligonucleotides. In this way the modified nucleoside, either for attachment at the ribose (i.e. amino- or thiol-modified nucleosides) or the base, is incorporated into the oligonucleotide at either an internal position or the 5&prime; terminus. This is generally done in one of two ways. First, the 5&prime; position of the ribose is protected with 4&prime;, 4-dimethoxytrityl (DMT) followed by reaction with either 2-cyanoethoxy-bis-diisopropylaminophosphine in the presence of diisopropylammonium tetrazolide, or by reaction with chlorodiisopropylamino 2&prime;-cyanoethyoxyphosphine, to give the phosphoramidite as is known in the art; although other techniques may be used as will be appreciated by those in the art. See Gait, supra; Caruthers, Science 230:281 (1985), both of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> For attachment of an electron transfer moiety to the 3&prime; terminus, a preferred method utilizes the attachment of the modified nucleoside to controlled pore glass (CPG) or other oligomeric supports. In this embodiment, the modified nucleoside is protected at the 5&prime; end with DMT, and then reacted with succinic anhydride with activation. The resulting succinyl compound is attached to CPG or other oligomeric supports as is known in the art. Further phosphoramidite nucleosides are added, either modified or not, to the 5&prime; end after deprotection. Thus, the present invention provides conductive oligomers covalently attached to nucleosides attached to solid oligomeric supports such as CPG, and phosphoramidite derivatives of the nucleosides of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The growing nucleic acid chain may also comprise at least one nucleoside with covalently attached second electron transfer moiety. As described herein, modified nucleosides with covalently attached second electron transfer moieties may be made, and incorporated into the nucleic acid as outlined above for the conductive oligomer-nucleosides. When a transition metal complex is used as the second electron transfer moiety, synthesis may occur in several ways. In a preferred embodiment, the ligand(s) are added to a nucleoside, followed by the transition metal ion, and then the nucleoside with the transition metal complex attached is added to an oligonucleotide, i.e. by addition to the nucleic acid synthesizer. Alternatively, the ligand(s) may be attached, followed by incorportation into a growing oligonucleotide chain, followed by the addition of the metal ion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, electron transfer moieties are attached to a ribose of the ribose-phosphate backbone. This is generally done as is outlined in PCT publication SO 95/15971, using amino-modified nucleosides, at either the 2&prime; or 3&prime; position of the ribose. The amino group may then be used either as a ligand, for example as a transition metal ligand for attachment of the metal ion, or as a chemically functional group that can be used for attachment of other ligands or organic electron transfer moieties, for example via amide linkages, as will be appreciated by those in the art. For example, the examples describe the synthesis of a nucleoside with a metallocene linked via an amide bond to the ribose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, electron transfer moieties are attached to a phosphate of the ribose-phosphate backbone. As outlined herein, this may be done using phosphodiester analogs such as phosphoramidite bonds, see generally PCT publication WO 95/15971, or can be done in a similar manner to that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, where the conductive oligomer is replaced by a transition metal ligand or complex or an organic electron transfer moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Attachment to alternate backbones, for example peptide nucleic acids or alternate phosphate linkages will be done as will be appreciated by those in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, electron transfer moieties are attached to a base of the nucleoside. This may be done in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, amino groups of the base, either naturally occurring or added as is described herein (see the figures, for example), are used either as ligands for transition metal complexes or as a chemically functional group that can be used to add other ligands, for example via an amide linkage, or organic electron transfer moieties. This is done as will be appreciated by those in the art. Alternatively, nucleosides containing halogen atoms attached to the heterocyclic ring are commercially available. Acetylene linked ligands may be added using the halogenated bases, as is generally known; see for example, Tzalis et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 36(34):6017-6020 (1995); Tzalis et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 36(2):3489-3490 (1995); and Tzalis et al., Chem. Communications (in press) 1996, all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. See also the examples, which describes the synthesis of a metallocene attached via an acetylene linkage to the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the nucleosides are made with transition metal ligands, incorporated into a nucleic acid, and then the transition metal ion and any remaining necessary ligands are added as is known in the art. In an alternative embodiment, the transition metal ion and additional ligands are added prior to incorporation into the nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, as outlined herein, conductive oligomers are used between the second electron transfer moieties and the nucleosides. These are made using the techniques described herein, with the addition of the terminal second electron transfer moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Once the nucleic acids of the invention are made, with a covalently attached conductive oligomer and optionally a second electron transfer moiety, the conductive oligomer is attached to the electrode. The method will vary depending on the type of electrode used. As is described herein, the conductive oligomers are generally made with a terminal &ldquo;A&rdquo; linker to facilitate attachment to the electrode. For the purposes of this application, a sulfur-gold attachment is considered a covalent attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, conductive oligomers are covalently attached via sulfur linkages to the electrode. However, surprisingly, traditional protecting groups for use of attaching molecules to gold electrodes are generally ideal for use in both synthesis of the compositions described herein and inclusion in oligonucleotide synthetic reactions. Accordingly, the present invention provides novel methods for the attachment of conductive oligomers to gold electrodes, utilizing unusual protecting groups, including ethylpyridine, and trimethylsilylethyl as is depicted in the Figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> This may be done in several ways. In a preferred embodiment, the subunit of the conductive oligomer which contains the sulfur atom for attachment to the electrode is protected with an ethyl-pyridine or trimethylsilylethyl group. For the former, this is generally done by contacting the subunit containing the sulfur atom (preferably in the form of a sulfhydryl) with a vinyl pyridine group or vinyl trimethylsilylethyl group under conditions whereby an ethylpyridine group or trimethylsilylethyl group is added to the sulfur atom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> This subunit also generally contains a functional moiety for attachment of additional subunits, and thus additional subunits are attached to form the conductive oligomer. The conductive oligomer is then attached to a nucleoside, and additional nucleosides attached. The protecting group is then removed and the sulfur-gold covalent attachment is made. Alternatively, all or part of the conductive oligomer is made, and then either a subunit containing a protected sulfur atom is added, or a sulfur atom is added and then protected. The conductive oligomer is then attached to a nucleoside, and additional nucleosides attached. Alternatively, the conductive oligomer attached to a nucleic acid is made, and then either a subunit containing a protected sulfur atom is added, or a sulfur atom is added and then protected. Alternatively, the ethyl pyridine protecting group may be used as above, but removed after one or more steps and replaced with a standard protecting group like a disulfide. Thus, the ethyl pyridine or trimethylsilylethyl group may serve as the protecting group for some of the synthetic reactions, and then removed and replaced with a traditional protecting group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;subunit&rdquo; of a conductive polymer herein is meant at least the moiety of the conductive oligomer to which the sulfur atom is attached, although additional atoms may be present, including either functional groups which allow the addition of additional components of the conductive oligomer, or additional components of the conductive oligomer. Thus, for example, when Structure 2 oligomers are used, a subunit comprises at least the first Y group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> A preferred method comprises 1) adding an ethyl pyridine or trimethylsilylethyl protecting group to a sulfur atom attached to a first subunit of a conductive oligomer, generally done by adding a vinyl pyridine or trimethylsilylethyl group to a sulfhydryl; 2) adding additional subunits to form the conductive oligomer; 3) adding at least a first nucleoside to the conductive oligomer; 4) adding additional nucleosides to the first nucleoside to form a nucleic acid; 5) attaching the conductive oligomer to the gold electrode. This may also be done in the absence of nucleosides, as is described in the Examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> The above method may also be used to attach passavation molecules to a gold electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a monolayer of passavation agents is added to the electrode. Generally, the chemistry of addition is similar to or the same as the addition of conductive oligomers to the electrode, i.e. using a sulfur atom for attachment to a gold electrode, etc. Compositions comprising monolayers in addition to the conductive oligomers covalently attached to nucleic acids (with or without second electron transfer moieties) may be made in at least one of five ways: (1) addition of the monolayer, followed by subsequent addition of the conductive oligomer-nucleic acid complex; (2) addition of the conductive oligomer-nucleic acid complex followed by addition of the monolayer; (3) simultaneous addition of the monolayer and conductive oligomer-nucleic acid complex; (4) formation of a monolayer (using any of 1, 2 or 3) which includes conductive oligomers which terminate in a functional moiety suitable for attachment of a completed nucleic acid; or (5) formation of a monolayer which includes conductive oligomers which terminate in a functional moiety suitable for nucleic acid synthesis, i.e. the nucleic acid is synthesized on the surface of the monolayer as is known in the art. Such suitable functional moieties include, but are not limited to, nucleosides, amino groups, carboxyl groups, protected sulfur moieties, or hydroxyl groups for phosphoramidite additions. The examples describe the formation of a monolayer on a gold electrode using the preferred method (1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those in the art, electrodes may be made that have any combination of nucleic acids, conductive oligomers and passavation agents. Thus, a variety of different conductive oligomers or passavation agents may be used on a single electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Once made, the compositions find use in a number of applications, as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the compositions of the invention are used as probes in hybridization assays to detect target sequences in a sample. The term &ldquo;target sequence&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein means a nucleic acid sequence on a single strand of nucleic acid. The target sequence may be a portion of a gene, a regulatory sequence, genomic DNA, cDNA, RNA including mRNA and rRNA, or others. It may be any length, with the understanding that longer sequences are more specific. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the complementary target sequence may take many forms. For example, it may be contained within a larger nucleic acid sequence, i.e. all or part of a gene or mRNA, a restriction fragment of a plasmid or genomic DNA, among others. As is outlined more fully below, probes are made to hybridize to target sequences to determine the presence or absence of the target sequence in a sample. Generally speaking, this term will be understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> If required, the target sequence is prepared using known techniques. For example, the sample may be treated to lyse the cells, using known lysis buffers, electroporation, etc., with purification and/or amplification occuring as needed, as will be appreciated by those in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> The probes of the present invention are designed to be complementary to the target sequence, such that hybridization of the target sequence and the probes of the present invention occurs. As outlined below, this complementarity need not be perfect; there may be any number of base pair mismatches which will interfere with hybridization between the target sequence and the single stranded nucleic acids of the present invention. However, if the number of mutations is so great that no hybridization can occur under even the least stringent of hybridization conditions, the sequence is not a complementary target sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> A variety of hybridization conditions may be used in the present invention, including high, moderate and low stringency conditions; see for example Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d Edition, 1989, and Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, ed. Ausubel, et al, hereby incorporated by referenece. The hybridization conditions may also vary when a non-ionic backbone, i.e. PNA is used, as is known in the art. In addition, cross-linking agents may be added after target binding to cross-link, i.e. covalently attach, the two strands of the hybridization complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, single stranded nucleic acids are made which contain a first electron transfer moiety, an electrode, and at least a second electron tranfer moiety. Hybridization to a target sequence forms a double stranded hybridization complex. In a hybridization complex, at least the sequence between the nucleosides containing the electron transfer moieties is double stranded, i.e. contains stacked &pgr;-orbitals, such that upon initiation, the complex is capable of transferring at least one electron from one of the electron transfer moieties to the other. As will be appreciated by those in the art, an electrode may serve as either an electron donor or acceptor, and the choice of the second electron transfer species is made accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, compositions comprising a) a first single stranded nucleic acid covalently attached to an electrode via a conductive oligomer and b) a second single stranded nucleic acid containing a second electron transfer moiety, are made. In this embodiment, the first single stranded nucleic acid is capable of hybridizing to a first target domain, and the second single stranded nucleic acid is capable of hybridizing to a second target domain. The terms &ldquo;first target domain&rdquo; and &ldquo;second target domain&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein means two portions of a target sequence within a nucleic acid which is under examination. The first target domain may be directly adjacent to the second target domain, or the first and second target domains may be separated by an intervening target domain. Preferably, there are no gaps between the domains; i.e. they are contiguous. The terms &ldquo;first&rdquo; and &ldquo;second&rdquo; are not meant to confer an orientation of the sequences with respect to the 5&prime;-3&prime; orientation of the target sequence. For example, assuming a 5&prime;-3&prime; orientation of the complementary target sequence, the first target domain may be located either 5&prime; to the second domain, or 3&prime; to the second domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the first single stranded nucleic acid is hybridized to the first target domain, and the second single stranded nucleic acid is hybridized to the second target domain to form a hybridization complex. As outlined above, the hybridization complex is then capable of transferring at least one electron between the electron transfer moieties upon initiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, compositions comprising a) a single stranded nucleic acid covalently attached to an electrode via a conductive oligomer, and b) a target nucleic acid are made. In this embodiment, once hybridization of the target and the probe occurs, a hybridization indicator is added. Hybridization indicators serve as an electron transfer moiety that will preferentially associate with double stranded nucleic acid is added, usually reversibly, similar to the method of Millan et al., Anal. Chem. 65:2317-2323 (1993); Millan et al., Anal. Chem. 662943-2948 (1994), both of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Hybridization indicators include intercalators and minor and/or major groove binding moieties. In a preferred embodiment, intercalators may be used; since intercalation generally only occurs in the presence of double stranded nucleic acid, only in the presence of target hybridization will electron transfer occur. Intercalating transition metal complex electron transfer moieties are known in the art. Similarly, major or minor groove binding moieties, such as methylene blue, may also be used in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In addition, hybridization indicators may be used in any or all of the other systems of the invention; for example, they may be added to facilitate, quench or amplify the signal generated by the system, in addition to the covalently attached electron transfer moieties. For example, it has been shown by Millan, above, that some hybridization indicators may preferentially bind to perfectly complementary double stranded nucleic acids over nucleic acids containing mismatches. This could serve to contribute additional information about the system. Similarly, electronic coupling could be increased due to hybridization indicator binding. Alternatively, quenching of the electron transfer signal could be acheived using hybridization indicators, whereby the electrons would flow between the second electron tranfer moiety and the hybridization indicator, rather than the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment utilizes compositions comprising a) a first single stranded nucleic acid covalently attached to an electrode via a conductive oligomer; b) a second single stranded nucleic acid containing a second electron transfer moiety; and c) an intervening single stranded nucleic acid, which may or may not be labelled or contain an electron transfer moiety. As generally outlined in PCT WO 95/15971, the first single stranded nucleic acid hybridizes to the first target domain, the second single stranded nucleic acid hybridizes to the second target domain, and the intervening nucleic acid hybridizes to the intervening target domain, with electron transfer upon initiation. The intervening nucleic acid may be any length, taking into consideration the parameters for the distance between the electron transfer moieties, although it may be a single nucleoside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In addition, the first and second, or first, intervening and second, nucleic acids may be ligated together prior to the electron transfer reaction, using standard molecular biology techniques such as the use of a ligase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the compositions of the invention are used to detect mismatches in a complementary target sequence. A mismatch, whether it be a substitution, insertion or deletion of a nucleoside or nucleosides, results in incorrect base pairing in a hybridized double helix of nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, if the path of an electron from an electron donor moiety to an electron acceptor moiety spans the region where the mismatch lies, the electron transfer will be reduced such that a change in the relative impedance will be seen. Therefore, in this embodiment, the electron donor moiety is attached to the nucleic acid at a 5&prime; position from the mutation, and the electron acceptor moiety is attached at a 3&prime; position, or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Electron transfer is generally initiated electronically, with voltage being preferred. A potential is applied to a sample containing modified nucleic acid probes. Precise control and variations in the applied potential can be via a potentiostat and either a three electrode system (one reference, one sample and one counter electrode) or a two electrode system (one sample and one counter electrode). This allows matching of applied potential to peak electron transfer potential of the system which depends in part on the choice of electron acceptors attached to the nucleic acid and in part on the conductive oligomer used. As described herein, ferrocene is a preferred electron transfer moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Preferably, initiation and detection is chosen to maximize the relative difference between the impedances of double stranded nucleic acid and single stranded nucleic acid systems. The efficiency of electron transfer through nucleic acid is a function of the impedance of the compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a co-reductant or co-oxidant (collectively, co-redoxant) is used, as an additional electron source or sink. See generally Sato et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn 66:1032 (1993); Uosaki et al., Electrochimica Acta 36:1799 (1991); and Alleman et al., J. Phys. Chem 100:17050 (1996); all of which are incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, an input electron source in solution is used in the initiation of electron transfer, preferably when initiation and detection are being done using DC current, and when a passavation agent monolayer is present on the electrode. This may be done in several general ways. In a preferred embodiment, an input electron source is used that has a lower or similar redox potential than the second electron transfer moiety (ETM) covalently attached to the probe nucleic acid. Thus, at voltages above the redox potential of the input electron source, both the second ETM and the input electron source are oxidized and can thus donate electrons; the ETM donates through the hybridization complex, through the conductive oligomer, to the electrode, and the input source donates to the ETM. For example, ferrocene, as a second ETM attached to the compositions of the invention as described in the examples, has a redox potential of roughly 200 mV in aqueous solution (which changes slightly depending on what the ferrocene is bound to). Ferrocyanide, an electron source, has a redox potential of roughly 200 mV as well (in aqueous solution). Accordingly, at or above voltages of roughly 200 mV, ferrocene is converted to ferricenium, which then transfers an electron to the nucleic acid. If this nucleic acid is double stranded, transfer proceeds rapidly through the double stranded nucleic acid, through the conductive oligomer, to the electrode. Now the ferricyanide can be oxidized to transfer an electron to the ETM. In this way, the electron source (or co-reductant) serves to amplify the signal generated in the system, as the electron source molecules rapidly and repeatedly donate electrons to the second ETM attached to the nucleic acid. The rate of electron donation or acceptance will be limited by the rate of diffusion of the co-reductant, which in turn is affected by the concentration and size, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, input electron sources that have lower redox potentials than the second ETM are used. At voltages less than the redox potential of the ETM, but higher than the redox potential of the electron source, the input source such as ferrocyanide is unable to be oxided and thus is unable to donate an electron to the ETM; i.e. no electron transfer occurs. The use of electron source molecules, however, is only possible when an insulating or passavation layer is present, since otherwise the source molecule will transfer electrons directly to the electrode. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, an electron source is used in solution to amplify the signal generated in the presence of hybridized target sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> In an alternate preferred embodiment, an input electron source is used that has a higher redox potential than the second electron transfer moiety (ETM) covalently attached to the probe nucleic acid. For example, luminol, an electron source, has a redox potential of roughly 720 mV. At voltages higher than the redox potential of the ETM, but lower than the redox potential of the electron source, i.e. 200-720 mV, the ferrocene is oxided, and transfers a single electron to the electrode via the conductive oligomer. However, the ETM is unable to accept any electrons from the luminol electron source, since the voltages are less than the redox potential of the luminol. However, at or above the redox potential of luminol, the luminol then transfers an electron to the ETM, allowing rapid and repeated electron transfer. In this way, the electron source (or co-reductant) serves to amplify the signal generated in the system, as the electron source molecules rapidly and repeatedly donate electrons to the second ETM attached to the nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Luminol has the added benefit of becoming a chemiluminiscent species upon oxidation (see Jirka et al., Analytica Chimica Acta 284:345 (1993)), thus allowing photo-detection of electron transfer through double-stranded nucleic acid. Thus, as long as the luminol is unable to contact the electrode directly, i.e. in the presence of a passavation layer, luminol can only be oxidized by transferring an electron to the second electron transfer moiety on the nucleic acid (e.g. ferrocene). When double stranded nucleic acid is not present, i.e. when the target sequence is not hybridized to the composition of the invention, the system has a high impedance, resulting in a low photon emission and thus a low (if any) signal from the luminol. In the presence of double stranded nucleic acid, i.e. target sequence hybridization, the second electron transfer moieties have low impedance, thus generating a much larger signal. Thus, the measure of luminol oxidation by photon emission is an indirect measurement of the ability of the second electron transfer moiety to donate electrons to the electrode. Furthermore, since photon detection is generally more sensitive than electronic detection, the sensitivity of the system may be increased. Initial results suggest that luminescence may depend on hydrogen peroxide concentration, pH, and luminol concentration, the latter of which appears to be non-linear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Suitable electron source molecules are well known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, ferricyanide, and luminol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, output electron acceptors or sinks could be used, i.e. the above reactions could be run in reverse, with the ETM such as a metallocene receiving an electron from the electrode, converting it to the metallicenium, with the output electron acceptor then accepting the electron rapidly and repeatedly. In this embodiment, cobalticenium is the preferred ETM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Electron transfer through nucleic acid can be detected in a variety of ways. A variety of detection methods may be used, including, but not limited to, optical detection, which includes fluorescence, phosphorescence, luminiscence, chemiluminescence, electrochemiluminescence, and refractive index; and electronic detection, including, but not limited to, amperommetry, voltammetry, capacitance and impedence. These methods include time or frequency dependent methods based on AC or DC currents, pulsed methods, lock-in techniques, filtering (high pass, low pass, band pass), and time-resolved techniques including time-resolved fluorescence. In some embodiments, all that is required is electron transfer detection; in others, the rate of electron transfer may be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the efficient transfer of electrons from one end of a nucleic acid double helix to the other results in stereotyped changes in the redox state of both the electron donor and acceptor. With many electron transfer moieties including the complexes of ruthenium containing bipyridine, pyridine and imidazole rings, these changes in redox state are associated with changes in spectral properties. Significant differences in absorbance are observed between reduced and oxidized states for these molecules. See for example Fabbrizzi et al., Chem. Soc. Rev. 1995 pp197-202). These differences can be monitored using a spectrophotometer or simple photomultiplier tube device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, possible electron donors and acceptors include all the derivatives listed above for photoactivation or initiation. Preferred electron donors and acceptors have characteristically large spectral changes upon oxidation and reduction resulting in highly sensitive monitoring of electron transfer. Such examples include Ru(NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>py and Ru(bpy)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>im as preferred examples. It should be understood that only the donor or acceptor that is being monitored by absorbance need have ideal spectral characteristics. That is, the electron acceptor can be optically invisible if only the electron donor is monitored for absorbance changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the electron transfer is detected fluorometrically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> Numerous transition metal complexes, including those of ruthenium, have distinct fluorescence properties. Therefore, the change in redox state of the electron donors and electron acceptors attached to the nucleic acid can be monitored very sensitively using fluorescence, for example with Ru(4,7-biphenyl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-phenanthroline)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>. The production of this compound can be easily measured using standard fluorescence assay techniques. For example, laser induced fluorescence can be recorded in a standard single cell fluorimeter, a flow through &ldquo;on-line&rdquo; fluorimeter (such as those attached to a chromatography system) or a multi-sample &ldquo;plate-reader&rdquo; similar to those marketed for 96-well immuno assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, fluorescence can be measured using fiber optic sensors with nucleic acid probes in solution or attached to the fiber optic. Fluorescence is monitored using a photomultiplier tube or other light detection instrument attached to the fiber optic. The advantage of this system is the extremely small volumes of sample that can be assayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> In addition, scanning fluorescence detectors such as the Fluorlmager sold by Molecular Dynamics are ideally suited to monitoring the fluorescence of modified nucleic acid molecules arrayed on solid surfaces. The advantage of this system is the large number of electron transfer probes that can be scanned at once using chips covered with thousands of distinct nucleic acid probes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Many transition metal complexes display fluorescence with large Stokes shifts. Suitable examples include bis- and trisphenanthroline complexes and bis- and trisbipyridyl complexes of transition metals such as ruthenium (see Juris, A., Balzani, V., et. al. Coord. Chem. Rev., V. 84, p. 85-277, 1988). Preferred examples display efficient fluorescence (reasonably high quantum yields) as well as low reorganization energies. These include Ru(4,7-biphenyl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-phenanthroline)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Ru(4,4&prime;-diphenyl-2,2&prime;-bipyridine)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> and platinum complexes (see Cummings et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118:1949-1960 (1996), incorporated by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a reduction in fluorescence associated with hybridization can be measured using these systems. An electron transfer &ldquo;donor&rdquo; molecule that fluoresces readily when on single stranded nucleic acid (with an &ldquo;acceptor&rdquo; on the other end) will undergo a reduction in fluorescent intensity when complementary nucleic acid binds the probe allowing efficient transfer of the excited state electron. This drop in fluorescence can be easily monitored as an indicator of the presence of a target sequence using the same methods as those above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, electrochemiluminescence is used as the basis of the electron transfer detection. With some electron transfer moieties such as Ru<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>(bpy)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, direct luminescence accompanies excited state decay. Changes in this property are associated with nucleic acid hybridization and can be monitored with a simple photomultiplier tube arrangement (see Blackburn, G. F. <highlight><italic>Clin. Chem. </italic></highlight>37: 1534-1539 (1991); and Juris et al., supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, electronic detection is used, including amperommetry, voltammetry, capacitance, and impedance. Suitable techniques include, but are not limited to, electrogravimetry; coulometry (including controlled potential coulometry and constant current coulometry); voltametry (cyclic voltametry, pulse voltametry (normal pulse voltametry, square wave voltametry, differential pulse voltametry, Osteryoung square wave voltametry, and coulostatic pulse techniques); stripping analysis (aniodic stripping analysis, cathiodic stripping analysis, square wave stripping voltammetry); conductance measurements (electrolytic conductance, direct analysis); time-dependent electrochemical analyses (chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, cyclic chronopotentiometry and amperometry, AC polography, chronogalvametry, and chronocoulometry); AC impedance measurement; capacitance measurement; AC voltametry; and photoelectrochemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, monitoring electron transfer through nucleic acid is via amperometric detection. This method of detection involves applying a potential (as compared to a separate reference electrode) between the nucleic acid-conjugated electrode and a reference (counter) electrode in the sample containing target genes of interest. Electron transfer of differing efficiencies is induced in samples in the presence or absence of target nucleic acid; that is, the presence or absence of the target nucleic acid alters the impedance of the nucleic acid (i.e. double stranded versus single stranded) system which can result in different currents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> The device for measuring electron transfer amperometrically involves sensitive current detection and includes a means of controlling the voltage potential, usually a potentiostat. This voltage is optimized with reference to the potential of the electron donating complex on the nucleic acid. Possible electron donating complexes include those previously mentioned with complexes of iron, osmium, platinum, cobalt, rhenium and ruthenium being preferred and complexes of iron being most preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, alternative electron detection modes are utilized. For example, potentiometric (or voltammetric) measurements involve non-faradaic (no net current flow) processes and are utilized traditionally in pH and other ion detectors. Similar sensors are used to monitor electron transfer through nucleic acid. In addition, other properties of insulators (such as resistance) and of conductors (such as conductivity, impedance and capicitance) could be used to monitor electron transfer through nucleic acid. Finally, any system that generates a current (such as electron transfer) also generates a small magnetic field, which may be monitored in some embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that one benefit of the fast rates of electron transfer observed in the compositions of the invention is that time resolution can greatly enhance the signal-to-noise results of monitors based on absorbance, fluorescence and electronic current. The fast rates of electron transfer of the present invention result both in high signals and stereotyped delays between electron transfer initiation and completion. By amplifying signals of particular delays, such as through the use of pulsed initiation of electron transfer and &ldquo;lock-in&rdquo; amplifiers of detection, between two and four orders of magnitude improvements in signal-to-noise may be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, electron transfer is initiated using alternating current (AC) methods. Without being bound by theory, it appears that nucleic acids, bound to an electrode, generally respond similarly to an AC voltage resistor and capacitor in series. Basically, any methods which enable the determination of the nature of these complexes, which act as a resistor and capacitor, can be used as the basis of detection. Surprisingly, traditional electrochemical theory, such as exemplified in Laviron et al., J. tlectroanal. Chem. 97:135 (1979) and Laviron et al., J. Electroanal. Chem. 105:35 (1979), both of which are incorporated by reference, do not accurately model the systems described herein, except for very small E<highlight><subscript>AC </subscript></highlight>(less than 10 mV). That is, the AC current (I) is not accurately described by Laviron&apos;s equation. This may be due in part to the fact that this theory assumes an unlimited source and sink of electrons, which is not true in the present systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, alternate equations were developed, using the Nernst equation and first principles to develop a model which more closely simulates the results. This was derived as follows. The Nernst equation, Equation 1 below, describes the ratio of oxidized (O) to reduced (R) molecules (number of molecules&equals;n) at any given voltage and temperature, since not every molecule gets oxidized at the same oxidation potential. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Taking into consideration the generation of an AC faradaic current, the ratio of &lsqb;O&rsqb;/&lsqb;R&rsqb; at any given potential must be evaluated. At a particular E<highlight><subscript>DC </subscript></highlight>with an applied E<highlight><subscript>AC</subscript></highlight>, as is generally described herein, at the apex of the E<highlight><subscript>AC </subscript></highlight>more molecules will be in the oxidized state, since the voltage on the surface is now (E<highlight><subscript>DC</subscript></highlight>&plus;E<highlight><subscript>AC</subscript></highlight>); at the bottom, more will be redued since the voltage is lower. Therefore, the AC current at a given E<highlight><subscript>DC </subscript></highlight>will be dictated by both the AC and DC voltages, as well as the shape of the curve. Specifically, if the number of oxidized molecules at the bottom of the AC cycle is subtracted from the amount at the top of the AC cycle, the total change in a given AC cycle is obtained, as is generally described by Equation 9. Dividing by 2 then gives the AC amplitude. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Using Equation 11, simulations were generated using increasing overpotential. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</cross-reference> shows one of these simulations, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</cross-reference> depicts a simulation based on traditional theory. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</cross-reference> depicts actual experimental data using the Fc-wire of Example 7 plotted with the simulation, and shows that the model fits the experimental data very well. In some cases the current is smaller than predicted, however this has been shown to be caused by ferrocene degradation which may be remedied in a number of ways. However, Equation 11 does not incorporate the effect of electron transfer rate nor of instrument factors. Electron transfer rate is important when the rate is close to or lower than the applied frequency. Thus, the true i<highlight><subscript>AC </subscript></highlight>should be a function of all three, as depicted in Equation 12. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> These equations can be used to model and predict the expected AC currents in systems which use input signals comprising both AC and DC components. As outlined above, traditional theory surprisingly does not model these systems at all, except for very low voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> In general, a single stranded probe nucleic acid system has a high impedance, and a double stranded nucleic acid system (i.e. probe hybridized to target to form a hybridization complex) has a lower impedance. This difference in impedance serves as the basis of a number of useful AC detection techniques, as outlined below, but as will be appreciated by those in the art, a wide number of techniques may be used. In addition, the use of AC input and output signals enables the identification of different species based on phase shifting between the AC voltage applied and the voltage or current response. Thus, AC detection gives several advantages as is generally discussed below, including an increase in sensitivity, the ability to monitor changes using phase shifting, and the ability to &ldquo;filter out&rdquo; background noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when using AC initiation and detection methods, the frequency response of the system changes as a result of hybridization to form a double-stranded nucleic acid. By &ldquo;frequency response&rdquo; herein is meant a modification of signals as a result of electron transfer between the electrode and the second electron transfer moiety. This modification is different depending on signal frequency. A frequency response includes AC currents at one or more frequencies, phase shifts, DC offset voltages, faradaic impedance, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a target sequence is added to a probe single stranded nucleic acid. Preferably, the probe single stranded nucleic acid comprises a covalently attached first electron transfer moiety comprising an electrode, and a covalently attached second electron transfer moiety as described above. However, as outlined herein, it is also possible to use a variety of other configurations in the system, including a second electron transfer moiety attached to the target nucleic acid, a second probe nucleic acid containing a second electron transfer moiety, intervening nucleic acids, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the single stranded nucleic acid is covalently attached to the electrode via a spacer. By &ldquo;spacer&rdquo; herein is meant a moiety which holds the nucleic acid off the surface of the electrode. In a preferred embodiment, the spacer is a conductive oligomer as outlined herein, although suitable spacer moieties include passavation agents and insulators as outlined above. The spacer moieties may be substantially non-conductive, although preferably (but not required) is that the rate of electron transfer through the spacer is faster than the rate through single stranded nucleic acid, although substantially non-conductive spacers are generally preferred. In general, the length of the spacer is as outlined for conductive polymers and passavation agents. Similarly, spacer moieties are attached as is outlined above for conductive oligomers, passavation agents and insulators, for example using the same &ldquo;A&rdquo; linker defined herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The target sequence is added to the composition under conditions whereby the target sequence, if present, will bind to the probe single stranded nucleic acid to form a hybridization complex, as outlined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> A first input electrical signal is then applied to the system, preferably via at least the sample electrode (containing the complexes of the invention) and the counter electrode, to initiate electron transfer between the electrode and the second electron transfer moiety. Three electrode systems may also be used, with the voltage applied to the reference and working electrodes. The first input signal comprises at least an AC component. The AC component may be of variable amplitude and frequency. Generally, for use in the present methods, the AC amplitude ranges from about 1 mV to about 1.1 V, with from about 10 mV to about 800 mV being preferred, and from about 10 mV to about 500 mV being especially preferred. The AC frequency ranges from about 0.01 Hz to about 10 MHz, with from about 1 Hz to about 1 MHz being preferred, and from about 1 Hz to about 100 kHz being especially preferred </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, the use of combinations of AC and DC signals allows the differentiation between single-stranded nucleic acid and double stranded nucleic acid, as is outlined herein. In addition, signals comprised of AC and DC components also allow surprising sensitivity and signal maximization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the first input signal comprises a DC component and an AC component. That is, a DC offset voltage between the sample and counter electrodes is swept through the electrochemical potential of the second electron transfer moiety (for example, when ferrocene is used, the sweep is generally from 0 to 500 mV). The sweep is used to identify the DC voltage at which the maximum response of the system is seen. This is generally at or about the electrochemical potential of the second electron transfer moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Once this voltage is determined, either a sweep or one or more uniform DC offset voltages may be used. DC offset voltages of from about &minus;1 V to about &plus;1.1 V are preferred, with from about &minus;500 mV to about &plus;800 mV being especially preferred, and from about &minus;300 mV to about 500 mV being particularly preferred. In a preferred embodiment, the DC offset voltage is not zero. On top of the DC offset voltage, an AC signal component of variable amplitude and frequency is applied. If the nucleic acid has a low enough impedance to respond to the AC perturbation, an AC current will be produced due to electron transfer between the electrode and the second electron transfer moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> For defined systems, it may be sufficient to apply a single input signal to differentiate between single stranded and double stranded (i.e. the presence of the target sequence) nucleic acid. Alternatively, a plurality of input signals are applied. As outlined herein, this may take a variety of forms, including using multiple frequencies, multiple DC offset voltages, or multiple AC amplitudes, or combinations of any or all of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Thus, in a preferred embodiment, multiple DC offset voltages are used, although as outlined above, DC voltage sweeps are preferred. This may be done at a single frequency, or at two or more frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the AC amplitude is varied. Without being bound by theory, it appears that increasing the amplitude increases the driving force. Thus, higher amplitudes, which result in higher overpotentials give faster rates of electron transfer. Thus, generally, the same system gives an improved response (i.e. higher output signals) at any single frequency through the use of higher overpotentials at that frequency. Thus, the amplitude may be increased at high frequencies to increase the rate of electron transfer through the system, resulting in greater sensitivity. In addition, this may be used, for example, to induce responses in slower systems such as single stranded nucleic acids for identification, calibration and/or quantification. Thus, the amount of unhybridized single stranded nucleic acid on an electrode may be compared to the amount of hybridized double stranded nucleic acid to quantify the amount of target sequence in a sample. This is quite significant to serve as an internal control of the sensor or system. This allows a measurement either prior to the addition of target or after, on the same molecules that will be used for detection, rather than rely on a similar but different control system. Thus, the actual molecules that will be used for the detection can be quantified prior to any experiment. For example, a preliminary run at 1 Hz or less, for example, will quantify the actual number of molecules that are on the surface of the electrode. The sample can then be added, an output signal determined, and the ratio of bound/unbound molecules determined. This is a significant advantage over prior methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, measurements of the system are taken at at least two separate amplitudes or overpotentials, with measurements at a plurality of amplitudes being preferred. As noted above, changes in response as a result of changes in amplitude may form the basis of identification, calibration and quantification of the system. In addition, one or more AC frequencies can be used as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the AC frequency is varied. At different frequencies, different molecules respond in different ways. As will be appreciated by those in the art, increasing the frequency generally increases the output current. However, when the frequency is greater than the rate at which electrons may travel between the electrode and the second electron transfer moiety, higher frequencies result in a loss or decrease of output signal. For example, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> response may be detected at 1 Hz for both single stranded nucleic acid and double stranded nucleic acid. However, at the higher frequencies, such as 200 Hz and above, the response of the single stranded nucleic acid is absent, while the response of the double stranded nucleic acid continues to increase. At some point, the frequency will be greater than the rate of electron transfer through even double-stranded nucleic acid, and then the output signal will also drop. Thus, the different frequency responses of single stranded and double stranded nucleic acids, based on the rate at which electrons may travel through the nucleic acid (i.e. the impedance of the nucleic acid), forms the basis of selective detection of double stranded nucleic acids versus single stranded nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, detection utilizes a single measurement of output signal at a single frequency. That is, the frequency response of a single stranded nucleic acid can be previously determined to be very low at a particular high frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Using this information, any response at a high frequency, for example such as to 100 kHz, where the frequency response of the single stranded nucleic acid is very low or absent, will show the presence of the double stranded hybridization complex. That is, any response at a high frequency is characteristic of the hybridization complex. Thus, it may only be necessary to use a single input high frequency, and any frequency response is an indication that the hybridization complex is present, and thus that the target sequence is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> In addition, the use of AC techniques allows the significant reduction of background signals at any single frequency due to entities other than the covalently attached nucleic acids, i.e. &ldquo;locking out&rdquo; or &ldquo;filtering&rdquo; unwanted signals. That is, the frequency response of a charge carrier or redox active molecule in solution will be limited by its diffusion coefficient and charge transfer coefficient. Accordingly, at high frequencies, a charge carrier may not diffuse rapidly enough to transfer its charge to the electrode, and/or the charge transfer kinetics may not be fast enough. This is particularly significant in embodiments that do not utilize a passavation layer monolayer or have partial or insufficient monolayers, i.e. where the solvent is accessible to the electrode. As outlined above, in DC techniques, the presence of &ldquo;holes&rdquo; where the electrode is accessible to the solvent can result in solvent charge carriers &ldquo;short circuiting&rdquo; the system. However, using the present AC techniques, one or more frequencies can be chosen that prevent a frequency response of one or more charge carriers in solution, whether or not a monolayer is present. This is particularly significant since many biological fluids such as blood contain significant amounts of redox active molecules which can interfere with amperometric detection methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, measurements of the system are taken at at least two separate frequencies, with measurements at a plurality of frequencies being preferred. A plurality of frequencies includes a scan. For example, measuring the output signal, e.g., the AC current, at a low input frequency such as 1-20 Hz, and comparing the response to the output signal at high frequency such as 10-100 kHz will show a frequency response difference between double stranded nucleic acids with fast electron transfer rates and single stranded nucleic acids with slow electron transfer rates. In a preferred embodiment, the frequency response is determined at at least two, preferably at least about five, and more preferably at least about ten frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> After transmitting the input signal to initiate electron transfer, an output signal is received or detected. The presence and magnitude of the output signal will depend on the overpotential/amplitude of the input signal; the frequency of the input AC signal; the composition of the intervening medium, i.e. the impedance, between the electron transfer moieties (i.e. single stranded versus double stranded, etc.); the DC offset; the environment of the system; the nature of the second electron transfer moiety; and the solvent. At a given input signal, the presence and magnitude of the output signal will depend in general on the impedance of the medium between the two electron transfer moieties and the character of the input signal. Double stranded nucleic acids, i.e. hybridization complexes, have relatively low impedance as compared to single stranded nucleic acids, and thus result in greater output signals. However, as noted herein, single stranded nucleic acids, in the absence of the complementary target, can result in electron transfer between the electron transfer moieties. Thus, upon transmitting the input signal, comprising an AC component and a DC offset, electrons are transferred between the first electron moiety, i.e. the electrode, and the second electron moiety covalently attached to the nucleic acid, when the impedance is low enough, the frequency is in range, and the amplitude is sufficient, resulting in an output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the output signal comprises an AC current. As outlined above, the magnitude of the output current will depend on a number of parameters. By varying these parameters, the system may be optimized in a number of ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> In general, AC currents generated in the present invention range from about 1 femptoamp to about 1 milliamp, with currents from about 50 femptoamps to about 100 microamps being preferred, and from about 1 picoamp to about 1 microamp being especially preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the output signal is phase shifted in the AC component relative to the input signal. Without being bound by theory, it appears that surprisingly, the systems of the present invention are sufficiently uniform to allow phase-shifting based detection. That is, the complex biomolecules of the invention through which electron transfer occurs react to the AC input in a homogeneous manner, similar to standard electronic components, such that a phase shift can be determined. This may serve as the basis of detection between single-stranded and double stranded nucleic acids, but more importantly, may allow the detection of mismatches, since small changes in impedance, such as would be assumed from a mismatch present in the hybridization complex, may effect the output AC phase in a greater manner than the frequency response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> The output signal is characteristic of electron transfer through the hybridization complex; that is, the output signal is characteristic of the presence of double stranded nucleic acid. In a preferred embodiment, the basis of the detection is a difference in the faradaic impedance of the system as a result of the formation of the hybridization complex. Faradaic impedance is the impedance of the system between the two electron transfer moieties, i.e. between the electrode and the second electron transfer moiety. Faradaic impedance is quite different from the bulk or dielectric impedance, which is the impedance of the bulk solution between the electrodes. Many factors may change the faradaic impedance which may not effect the bulk impedance, and vice versa. Thus, nucleic acids in this system have a certain faradaic impedance, that will depend on the distance between the electron transfer moieties, their electronic properties, and the composition of the intervening medium, among other things. Of importance in the methods of the invention is that the faradaic impedance between the electron transfer moieties is signficantly different depending on whether the intervening nucleic acid is single stranded or double stranded. Thus, the faradaic impedance of the system changes upon the formation of a hybridization complex, and it is this change which is characteristic of the hybridization complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention further provides apparatus for the detection of nucleic acids using AC detection methods. The apparatus includes a test chamber which has at least a first measuring or sample electrode, and a second measuring or counter electrode. Three electrode systems are also useful. The first and second measuring electrodes are in contact with a test sample receiving region, such that in the presence of a liquid test sample, the two electrodes may be in electrical contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the first measuring electrode comprises a single stranded nucleic acid covalently attached via a spacer, and preferably via a conductive oligomer, such as are described herein. In one embodiment, the second electron transfer moiety may be attached to the probe single stranded nucleic acid, or it may be attached to a second probe nucleic acid, the target nucleic acid, or may be added separately, for example as an intercalator. In a preferred embodiment, the second electron transfer moiety is covalently attached to the probe single stranded nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> The apparatus further comprises an AC voltage source electrically connected to the test chamber; that is, to the measuring electrodes. Preferably, the AC voltage source is capable of delivering DC offset voltage as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus further comprises a processor capable of comparing the input signal and the output signal. The processor is coupled to the electrodes and configured to receive an output signal, and thus detect the presence of the target nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> Thus, the compositions of the present invention may be used in a variety of research, clinical, quality control, or field testing settings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the probes are used in genetic diagnosis. For example, probes can be made using the techniques disclosed herein to detect target sequences such as the gene for nonpolyposis colon cancer, the BRCA1 breast cancer gene, P53, which is a gene associated with a variety of cancers, the Apo E4 gene that indicates a greater risk of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, allowing for easy presymptomatic screening of patients, mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene, or any of the others well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> In an additional embodiment, viral and bacterial detection is done using the complexes of the invention. In this embodiment, probes are designed to detect target sequences from a variety of bacteria and viruses. For example, current blood-screening techniques rely on the detection of anti-HIV antibodies. The methods disclosed herein allow for direct screening of clinical samples to detect HIV nucleic acid sequences, particularly highly conserved HIV sequences. In addition, this allows direct monitoring of circulating virus within a patient as an improved method of assessing the efficacy of anti-viral therapies. Similarly, viruses associated with leukemia, HTLV-I and HTLV-II, may be detected in this way. Bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, clymidia and other sexually transmitted diseases, may also be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids of the invention find use as probes for toxic bacteria in the screening of water and food samples. For example, samples may be treated to lyse the bacteria to release its nucleic acid, and then probes designed to recognize bacterial strains, including, but not limited to, such pathogenic strains as, Salmonella, Campylobacter, <highlight><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></highlight>, enterotoxic strains of <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, and Legionnaire&apos;s disease bacteria. Similarly, bioremediation strategies may be evaluated using the compositions of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, the probes are used for forensic &ldquo;DNA fingerprinting&rdquo; to match crime-scene DNA against samples taken from victims and suspects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> In an additional embodiment, the probes in an array are used for sequencing by hybridization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> The present invention also finds use as a unique methodology for the detection of mutations or mismatches in target nucleic acid sequences. As a result, if a single stranded nucleic acid containing electron transfer moieties is hybridized to a target sequence with a mutation, the resulting perturbation of the base pairing of the nucleosides will measurably affect the electron transfer rate. This is the case if the mutation is a substitution, insertion or deletion. Alternatively, two single stranded nucleic acids each with a covalently attached electron transfer species that hybridize adjacently to a target sequence may be used. Accordingly, the present invention provides for the detection of mutations in target sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides for extremely specific and sensitive probes, which may, in some embodiments, detect target sequences without removal of unhybridized probe. This will be useful in the generation of automated gene probe assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment the electron transfer moieties are on separate strands. In this embodiment, one single stranded nucleic acid has an electrode covalently attached via a conductive oligomer. The putative target sequences are labelled with a second electron transfer moiety as is generally described herein, i.e. by incorporating an electron transfer moiety to individual nucleosides of a PCR reaction pool. Upon hybridization of the two single-stranded nucleic acids, electron transfer is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the compositions of the invention are useful to detect successful gene amplification in PCR, thus allowing successful PCR reactions to be an indication of the presence or absence of a target sequence. PCR may be used in this manner in several ways. For example, in one embodiment, the PCR reaction is done as is known in the art, and then added to a composition of the invention comprising the target nucleic acid with a second ETM, covalently attached to an electrode via a conductive oligomer with subsequent detection of the target sequence. Alternatively, PCR is done using nucleotides labelled with a second ETM, either in the presence of, or with subsequent addition to, an electrode with a conductive oligomer and a target nucleic acid. Binding of the PCR product containing second ETMs to the electrode composition will allow detection via electron transfer. Finally, the nucleic acid attached to the electrode via a conductive polymer may be one PCR primer, with addition of a second primer labelled with an ETM. Elongation results in double stranded nucleic acid with a second ETM and electrode covalently attached. In this way, the present invention is used for PCR detection of target sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> In an additional embodiment, the present invention provides novel compositions comprising metallocenes covalently attached via conductive oligomers to an electrode, such as are generally depicted in Structure 35:

<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> A clean gold covered microscope slide was incubated in a solution containing 100 micromolar HS&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>&mdash;COOH in ethanol at room temperature for 4 hours. The electrode was then rinsed throughly with ethanol and dried. 20-30 microliters of wire-i solution (1 micromolar in 1&times;SSC buffer at pH 7.5) was applied to the electrode in a round droplet. The electrode was incubated at room temperature for 4 hours in a moist chamber to minimize evaporation. The wire-1 solution was then removed from the electrode and the electrode was immersed in 1&times;SSC buffer followed by 4 rinses with 1&times;SSC. The electrode was then stored at room temperature for up to 2 days in 1&times;SSC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, and preferably, either a &ldquo;two-step&rdquo; or &ldquo;three-step&rdquo; process is used. The &ldquo;two-step&rdquo; procedure is as follows. The wire-1 compound, in water at &tilde;5-10 micromolar concentration, was exposed to a clean gold surface and incubated for &tilde;24 hrs. It was rinsed well with water and then ethanol. The gold was then exposed to a solution of &tilde;100 micromolar insulator thiol in ethanol for &tilde;12 hrs, and rinsed well. Hybridization was done with complement for over 3 hrs. Generally, the hybridization solution was warmed to 500&deg; C., then cooled in order to enhance hybridization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;three-step&rdquo; procedure uses the same concentrations and solvents as above. The clean gold electrode was incubated in insulator solution for &tilde;1 hr and rinsed. This procedure presumably results in an incomplete monolayer, which has areas of unreacted gold. The slide was then incubated with wire-1 solution for over 24 hrs (generally, the longer the better). This wire- 1 still had the ethyl-pyridine protecting group on it. The wire-I solution was 5% NH40H, 15% ethanol in water. This removed the protecting group from the wire and allowed it to bind to the gold (an in situ deprotection). The slide was then incubated in insulator again for &tilde;12 hrs, and hybridized as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> In general, a variety of solvent can be used including water, ethanol, acetonitrile, buffer, mixtures etc. Also, the input of energy such as heat or sonication appears to speed up all of the deposition processes, although it may not be necessary. Also, it seems that longer incubation periods for the wire-1 addition step, for example as long as a week, the better the results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> Hybridization efficiency was determined using <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>p complementary and noncomplementary 15 mers corresponding to the wire-1 sequence.

The electrodes were then incubated for 1-2 hours at room temperature in a moist chamber, and rinsed as described above. The amount of radiolabelled DNA was measured for each electrode in a scintllation counter, and the electrodes were dried and exposed to X-ray film for 4 hours.

<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> It has been shown in the literature that cyclic voltametry can be used to determine the electron transfer rate of surface bound molecules. Surface bound molecules should show perfectly symetric oxidation and reduction peaks if the scan speed of the voltammagram is sufficiently slow. As the scan rate is increased, these peaks are split apart due to the kinetics of electron transfer through the molecules. At a given scan speed, a poorly conducting molecule should exhibit greater splitting than a good conductor. As the speed is increased, the poor conductor will be split even more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, to test the conductivity of the conductive polymer as compared to a traditional insulator, two molecules were tested. The synthesis of ferrocene attached via a conductive oligomer to an electrode (herein &ldquo;wire-2&rdquo;) was made as follows, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> Synthesis of compound <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> was as follows. 2.33 gr (5.68 nmole) of compound &num;<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (made as described in Hsung et al., Organometallics 14:4808-4815 (1995), incorporated by reference), 90 mg (0.47 mmole) of Cul and 80 mg (0.11 mmole) of PdCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>were dissolved in 100 ml of pyrrolidine under inert atmosphere and heated for 20 hrs at 50&deg; C. All volatile components were removed on high vacuum and resulted crude residue was dissolved in minimum amount of dichloromethane. The desired compound was purified by silica gel chromatography (50% ethyl acetate&plus;50% dichloromethane as eluent). 3.2 gr (90% yield) of the pure product were obtained. </paragraph>

After that time volume of the resulted solution was reduced by rotovap evaporation to 50 ml and then 400 ml of n-hexane were added. Formed precipitate was filtered out, washed with 3&times;200 ml of n-hexane and dried on high vacuum. Quantitative yield of the desired compound was obtained. </paragraph>

To 100 mg (0.13 mmole) of suspension of MG&num;2 in 200 ml of acetone (sonication was applied in order to get better results) 10 ml of triethyl amine were added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 20 hrs at RT. After that time volume of the resulted solution was reduced by rotovap evaporation to 50 ml and then 400 ml of n-hexane were added. Formed precipitate was filtered out, washed with 3&times;200 ml of n-hexane and dried on high vacuum. The desired compound was extracted from this precipitate with 3&times;50 ml of THF. Evaporation of the THF fractions gave 35 mg (52%) of the compound &num;<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This was then added to a gold electrode as known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> HS-(CH2)15NHCO-Fc (herein &ldquo;insulator-1&rdquo;) was made as described in Ward et al., Anal. Chem. 66:3164-3172 (1994), hereby incorporated by reference (note: the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> data has been shown to be incorrect, although the synthesis of the molecule is correct). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> Monolayers of each were made as follows. Insulator: Gold covered microscope slides were immersed in a mixture of insulator-1 and HS&mdash;(CH2)15-OH (insulator-2) in neat ethanol. Insulator-2 molecule is added to the mixture to prevent the local concentration of ferrocene at any position from being too high, resulting in interactions between the ferrocene molecules. The final solution was 0.1 mM insulator-1 and 0.9 mM insulator-2. The mixture was sonicated and heated (60-80&deg; C.) for 1-10 hours. The electrodes were rinsed thoroughly with ethanol, water and ethanol. The electrodes were immersed in a 1 mM thiol solution in neat ethanol and let stand at room temperature for 2-60 hours. The electrodes were then rinsed again. This procedure resulted in 1-10% coverage of insulator-1 as compared to calculated values of close packed ferrocene molecules on a surface. More or less coverage could easily be obtained by altering the mixture concentration and/or incubation times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> Wires: The same procedure was followed as above, except that the second step coating required between 10 and 60 hours, with approximately 24 hours being preferable. This resulted in lower coverages, with between 0.1 and 3% occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> Cyclic voltametry was run at 3 scan speeds for each compound: 1 V/sec, 10 V/ec, and 50 V/sec. Even at 1 V/sec, significant splitting occurs with insulator-1, with roughly 50 mV splitting occuring. At higher speeds, the splitting increases. With wire-2, however, perfectly symmetrical peaks are observed at the lower speeds, with only slight splitting occurring at 50 V/sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that despite a significant difference in electron transfer rate, electron transfer does still occur even in poorly conducting oligomers such as (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>, traditionally called &ldquo;insulators&rdquo;. Thus the terms &ldquo;conductive oligomer&rdquo; and &ldquo;insulator&rdquo; are somewhat relative. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Synthesis and Analysis of Nucleic Acid With Both a Conductive Oligomer and a Second Electron Transfer Moiety </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> The following nucleic acid composition was made using the techniques above: 5&prime;-ACCATGGAC&lsqb;UBF&rsqb;CAGCU-conductive polymer (Structure 5 type, as outlined above) herein &ldquo;wire-3&rdquo;, with UBF made as described above. Thus, the second electron transfer moiety, ferrocene, is on the sixth base from the conductive oligomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> Mixed monolayers of wire-3 and insulator-2 were constructed using the techniques outlined above. The compositions were analyzed in 0.2 M NaClO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>in water using cyclic voltametry (CV) and square wave voltametry (SW), in the absence (i.e. single stranded) and presence (i.e. double stranded) of complementary target sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> The results of SW show the absence of a peak prior to hybridization, i.e. in the absence of double stranded nucleic acid. In the presence of the complementary target sequence, a peak at &tilde;240 mV, corresponding to ferrocene, was seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> A mediator as described herein was also used. 6 mM ferricyanide (Fe(CN)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>) was added to the solution. Ferricyanide should produce a peak at 170 mV in a SW experiment. However, no peak at 170 mV was observed, but the peak at 240 mV was greatly enhanced as compared to the absence of ferricyanide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, CV was done. No peaks were observed in the absence of target sequence. Once again, the chip was incubated with perfectly complimentary nucleic acid in order to hybridize the surface nucleic acid. Again, the chip was scanned under the same conditions. An increased signal was observed. Finally, the chip was soaked in buffer at 70&deg; C. in order to melt the compliment off the surface. Previous experiments with radioactive probes have shown that 15-mers hybridized on a very similar surface melted at approximately 45&deg; C. Repeating the scan after the heat treatment shows a reduced signal, as in the first scan prior to hybridization. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> Electrodes containing four different compositions of the invention were made and used in AC detection methods. In general, all the electrodes were made by mixing a ratio of insulator-2 with the sample as is generally outlined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> Sample 1, labeled herein as &ldquo;Fc-alkane&rdquo;, contained a mixed monolayer of insulator-2 and insulator-1. Sample 2, labeled herein as &ldquo;Fc-amido-alkane&rdquo;, contained a mixed monolayer of insulator-2 and a derivative of insulator-1 which has an amido attachment of the ferrocene to the alkane. Sample 3, labeled herein as &ldquo;Fc-wire&rdquo;, contained a mixed monolayer of insulator-2 and wire-2. Sample 4 was the same as Sample 3, with the exception that a new in situ deprotection step was used, described below. Sample 5, labeled herein as &ldquo;ssDNA&rdquo;, contained a mixed monolayer of insulator-2 and wire-3. Sample 6, labeled herein as &ldquo;dsDNA&rdquo;, contained a mixed monolayer of insulator-2 and wire-3, wherein the complement of wire-3 was hybridized to form a double stranded wire-3. Sample 7 was a solution of ferrocene in solution. As is shown herein, the rate of electron transfer, from fast to slower, is as follows: Sample 3 &gt;Sample 5 &gt;Sample 1 &gt;Sample 4. Generally, Sample 1 models ssDNA, and Sample 3 models dsDNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> The experiments were run as follows. A DC offset voltage between the working (sample) electrode and the reference electrode was swept through the electrochemical potential of the ferrocene, typically from 0 to 500 mV. On top of the DC offset, an AC signal of variable amplitude and frequency was applied. The AC current at the excitation frequency was plotted versus the DC offset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> depicts an experiment with Sample 1, at 200 mV AC amplitude and frequencies of 1, 5 and 100 Hz. Sample 1 responds at all three frequencies, and higher currents result from higher frequencies, which is simply a result of more electrons per second being donated by the ferrocene at higher frequencies. The faster the rate, the higher the frequency response, and the better the detection limit. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows overlaid AC voltammograms of an electrode coated with Sample 3. Four excitation frequencies were applied: 10 Hz, 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 kHz, all at 25 mV overpotential. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, shows the frequency response of the system by measuring the peak currents. Sample 3 response to increasing frequencies through 10 kHz (the detector system limit), while Sample 1 lose its responses at between 20 and 200 Hz. Thus, to discriminate between Sample 1 and Sample 3, one would only have to analyze it at 1 Hz and 1000 Hz and compare the responses. This should be similar to the dsDNA and ssDNA system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows Sample 5 and Sample 6, plotted as a function of normalized current (with the highest current being 1 for both cases; the actual current of dsDNA is much higher than that of ssDNA, so the graph was normalized to show both). The lines are modeled RC circuits, as described above, and not a fit to the data. At 1 Hz, both ssDNA and dsDNA respond; at 200 Hz, the ssDNA signal is gone. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows that increasing the overpotential will increase the output signal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference> show that the overpotential and frequency can be tuned to increase the selectivity and sensitivity. For example, a low overpotential and high frequence can be used to minimize the slower species (Sample 1 or Sample 5). Then the overpotential can be increased to induce a response in the slower species for calibration and quantification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows that the ferrocene added to the solution (Sample 7) has a frequency response related to diffusion that is easily distinguishable from the frequency response of attached ferrocene. This indicates that by varying frequency, signals from bound molecules, particular fast bound molecules such as dsDNA, can be easily distinguished from any signal generated by contaminating redox molecules in the sample. </paragraph>
