<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the printed circuit board industry, many of the processing steps for manufacturing a circuit board are automated, most usually by conveyorizing processing machinery. Printed circuit boards are generally formed from a layer of conductive material, such as copper or copper plated with solder or gold, carried on a substrate of insulating material, such as plastic or fiberglass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The preparation of a printed circuit board in an automated electroplating system typically requires the plating of conductive metal layers onto the insulating substrate of the board. A circuit board may comprise a copper layer on opposite surfaces of the insulating substrate (two-sided boards). Alternatively, a circuit board may comprise multi-layer boards having a plurality of inter-leaved parallel planar copper and insulating layers. Through-holes may be drilled in the board and metal plated to create an electrical connection between the circuits formed on the different copper layers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides apparatus and methods for the processing of one or more panels having at least one through hole. Typically, various embodiments of the invention will process a stack of such panels having at least one through hole in each panel configured to provide a fluid path through the panel stack. The types of panels for use with the invention include a wide variety of panels, such as, for example, plastic or fiberglass panels used for the construction of circuit boards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Through holes in circuit boards are typically from about 0.05 mm to about 5 mm in diameter, although the invention is not so limited. Through holes may initially comprise a nonconductive cylindrical bore. Through holes may also communicate between two conductive surfaces that may be formed along the surface of the circuit board. According to various embodiments of the invention, a conductive material or element may be positioned in the through hole and electrically connected with the conducting sheets or layers to complete an electrical connection between two or more circuit layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A panel processing apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided. The housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is adapted for fluid communication with one or more panels forming a panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may optionally be provided with a seal along all or a portion of the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> interfacing with the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form a fluid or gas-tight seal of the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a surface of the panel stack <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be provided with an entry port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and those of other figures, may be inverted or arranged a variety of ways, such as sideways or at an angle, within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, a location adjustment apparatus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be provided to move the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> relative to a panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A variety of devices may be used to form the location adjustment apparatus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, such as a hoist or winch using a chain, a cable, rope, gears, wheels, pulleys, hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, or other devices capable of inducing movement, to move the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further examples include the use of rails or guides to define an axis of travel for the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may than be moved along the axis of travel by the use of a variety of devices, such as a chain, a cable, rope, gears, wheels, pulleys, hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders or other devices capable of inducing movement. These examples are not limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, a pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> may optionally be provided for creating a pressure differential in the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by providing or extracting a fluid or gas from the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via the entry port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. According to a further embodiment, a reservoir <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may optionally be provided fluidly coupled to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for providing or storing a fluid or gas for use with the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via the entry port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The reservoir <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be used in combination with the pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> or may be used without a pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. According to an embodiment of the invention, the pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and/or the reservoir <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may form a fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in communication with the entry port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In various embodiments of the invention, additional components, such as, for example, additional reservoirs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, pumps <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> or valves may also be incorporated into the fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be used to deliver or extract a gas from the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and that the reservoirs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may each be optionally heated or cooled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the invention, a controller <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is optionally provided. The controller <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be in communication with and control the operation of the location adjustment apparatus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may alternatively or in addition be in communication with and control the fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> or any component thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the present invention may be used for a variety of processes for panels. Examples include chemical etchback or desmear, which are processes used to make sure that all conductive surfaces intersecting a through hole wall are free of any non-conductive residue from drilling, such as plastic or fiberglass, that might interfere with electrical contact with the conductive surfaces. Chemicals used in conventional etchback or desmear procedures, using conventional baths or tanks, can also be used with various embodiments of the invention. Embodiments of the present invention can process many more panels more quickly, with smaller amounts of chemicals, than conventional procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A further example of a process for use with the invention is honing of the through hole wall using a slurry of pumice as a replacement for chemical etchback or desmear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Another example is chemical microetching of a through hole wall. When Teflon-based materials are used as the insulating layer of a printed circuit board in place of the more typical fiberglass, etchants known to those in the art can be used with various embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An additional example of a use of the invention is through hole blasting with pressurized water or air to clean away any debris left in the holes from the drilling process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In operation, an embodiment of the panel processing apparatus <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may operate as follows. The panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, having one or more panels, is located in communication with an interior of the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The optional location adjustment apparatus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be operated by the use of the optional controller <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in order to locate the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The optional one or more reservoirs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> contain the appropriate fluid or gas. Appropriate fluid or gas may include such fluids or gas as those known in the art for performing processes as described herein and others apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The optional controller <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be used to control the supply of the appropriate fluid or gas into the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by way of the entry port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The optional pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> may further be used to provide a pressure differential to the fluid or gas passing through the entry port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The fluid or gas supplied into the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> passes through those through holes in the one or more panels that define a path through the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is understood that the above process may also operate in reverse, with a fluid or gas administered to a distal side of the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and passing through the through holes of the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, through the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The fluid or gas may then travel through the entry port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the optional reservoir <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, optionally with the assistance of the pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;aligned&rdquo; or &ldquo;alignment&rdquo; are used to describe the configuration of a through hole in each of at least two panels that are arranged so as to form a continuous open path through the panels. Alignment of through holes may be achieved with through holes of differing diameter or with some non-round holes. Furthermore, there is no requirement for the sides of the through holes to form a continuous surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While alignment of the through holes such that all corresponding through hole walls form a continuous surface is desirable, it is not necessary. Even if the through holes are not so aligned, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, provided that there is at least one continuous path <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through the panels, the liquid or gas will be able to contact the wall surface of the holes in panels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> when directed through the hole of panel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of a panel processing apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> according to the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The panel processing apparatus <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is similar to the panel processing apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, except that a frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is provided as illustrated by way of example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to assist in locating the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be formed having only sides along a perimeter, or may also be provided with a bottom. The frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may also be provided with a seal for interfacing with the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The location adjustment apparatus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may optionally be coupled to move any or all of the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a further embodiment of the invention. According to this embodiment, a panel processing apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is provided similar to the panel processing apparatuses <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. The panel processing apparatus <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> additionally provides an intermediate housing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The intermediate housing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> allows the simultaneous processing of multiple panel stacks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> first panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be processed simultaneously with a second panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The intermediate housing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can be used to process panel stacks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having differing through hole patterns. For example, the panels of first panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have no through holes in locations that would correspond to the through holes of second panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. However, because the intermediate housing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is located between first panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and second panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the fluid or gas being processed through the through holes is able to travel within the open cavity of the intermediate housing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to exit from the through holes of the bottom of the first panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and travel to the top of the through holes of the second panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As described herein in relation to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the intermediate housing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be formed with one or more seals for interfacing with the panels stacks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is the use of a further embodiment of the frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is formed similar to the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to allow the optional application of a pressure differential to the bottom of the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or to aid in collection of the fluid or gas processed through the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may also be provided with a seal for interfacing with the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be used in combination with any of the embodiments described herein. For example, the frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be used with a single panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and/or without the use of the intermediate housing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. An egress port <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may optionally be provided to allow for entry or exit of fluids or gasses from the frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention provides a system and a method for the direct metalization and electroplating of a circuit board. In particular an embodiment provides a system and method for the simultaneous direct metalization and electroplating of a plurality of aligned circuit boards. Those skilled in the art will recognize that an embodiment of the invention can be applied to any treatment of the interior of the holes of a panel, as opposed to the surfaces of the panel, including conventional electroless copper deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Major cost elements in the manufacture of printed circuit boards are the deposition and electroplating of copper. These process steps have the combined purpose of rendering the interior of the drilled holes conductive and then to make use of the conductivity of this coating to further plate a suitable thickness of copper onto the hole walls. Conventional automated electroplating systems consist of machinery for conveying racks of personal computer (PC) board panels through a series of baths or tanks containing electrolyte in a sequential process in order to accomplish the plating of the circuit boards. Electroplating involves coating a conductive layer, such as copper, on the nonconductive through hole bore to provide a cylindrical bridge between the conducting sheets on the opposite ends of the through hole. Prior to the electroplating process, a through hole must first be treated with a conductive material to make the hole surface amenable to electroplating. The preparation process generally comprises either conventional electroless copper deposition or the increasingly more current direct metalization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Direct metalization consists of the use of a carbon or graphite-based product to coat the inside of the drilled holes in a circuit board with a sufficiently conductive layer so as to allow the eventual electroplating of a thicker metalization product layer, such as a copper layer, onto the walls of the holes. The conductive direct metalization coating is preceded by one or more cleanings and rinsing steps and is followed by, first, a drying step to dry the carbon or graphite product and second, by a micro-etching of the copper which releases the carbon or graphite product from the copper surfaces, leaving it only where required, namely, on the plastic surfaces of the hole walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In conventional conveyorized systems, the copper surfaces of the boards, as well as the through holes, are exposed to and coated with the cleaner, direct metalization product and electroplating product. The excess products must then be removed from the copper surfaces of the boards. Thus, a large portion of the cleaner and direct metalization product is wasted by coming into contact with the copper surfaces of the panels being processed rather than solely with the surface of the hole walls. In addition, conventional systems require large conveyor belts for sequentially processing each board in a time-consuming, multi-step preparation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the present invention, the direct metalization process and the electroplating process are facilitated by stacking a plurality of circuit boards such that the holes of the circuit board are in alignment in order to process a number of boards simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a segment of the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of three panels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> being fabricated according to an embodiment of the present invention. Each panel comprises a core <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprised of fiberglass, plastic or another insulating material, a top coating <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> comprised of copper or other suitable material, and a bottom coating <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> also comprised of copper or other suitable material. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise any number of panels. According to an embodiment of invention, the panels may be stacked such that the drilled through holes <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the panels are in alignment, providing a fluid communication path <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> between the panels. Cleaner, rinse fluid, direct metalization product and air are introduced in sequence into the through holes to simultaneously prepare all three panels <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for electroplating. In this fashion, the chemical products being used are primarily directed to the through hole walls, and are inhibited from contact with the top or bottom surfaces of the panels. It is noted that the top surface of the top panel and the bottom surface of the bottom panel may be in contact with the chemical products in some embodiments of the invention. As a result, the chemistry products may be used with greater efficiency, with limited chemistry products wasted by contacting surface areas of the panels that do not require direct metalization or electroplating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts a direct metalization apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention for applying a selected metalization product to the wall of a through hole in a circuit board. The apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> allows the succession of cleaner, rinse, direct metalization product, and air from a fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be sequenced through at least one through hole of a circuit board. The housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided for communication with the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be formed as an upper plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also provided opposite the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, illustrated as a lower plenum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The upper plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is positioned above the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and has the entry port <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for receiving the products from the fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for the direct metalization process of the panel stack. An optional lower plenum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be situated below the stack of panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and includes an egress port <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for draining away the various products from the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. According to an illustrative embodiment, the lower plenum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is selectively moveably coupled to the upper plenum and/or panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the optional use of the location adjustment apparatus <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to vary the distance between the upper and lower plenum and/or panel stack. In this manner, direct metalization apparatus can accommodate a variety of sizes of panels stacks and the panel stack can comprise any number of panels. The edges of the plenums <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may include seals <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, illustrated as O-rings, to sealingly contact the panel stack and thus inhibit leakage of the chemistry. According to an alternative embodiment, adapter frames with O-rings, inserted <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, are used to adapt the system to smaller panel sizes. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the stack of panels <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed in the housing between the upper plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the lower plenum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. According to one embodiment of the invention, the upper plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and lower plenum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are clamped so as to bring the plenums closer together against the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> initializes the direct metalization process by pumping cleaner from a reservoir <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> through a first valve <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and into the upper plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The cleaner then passes through at least one through hole of the panel stack. Pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> provides a sufficient negative pressure differential to enhance the flow of the cleaner and assure passage of the cleaner through the through hole. While a pressurized flow is preferable, gravity is also sufficient for effecting a flow through the though holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the panel stack may contain between one and a hundred or even more panels. Provided that there is a through hole path through the panel stack, there is virtually no limit to the number of panels being processed at one time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> After the cleaner drains away through egress port <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> on the lower plenum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an analogous step is performed using a rinse fluid, such as water, to rinse away the cleaner. The rinse fluid is pumped from a rinse fluid reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, through a second valve <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and into the upper plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The rinse fluid flows through the one or more through holes in the panel stack and drains through the egress port <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. If necessary, the cleaner and rinse steps are repeated any number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The rinsing step is then followed by a direct metalization step, where a direct metalization product, such as a carbon or graphite-based product, is similarly pumped from a reservoir <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> through a valve <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and finally through the through holes. The direct metalization product coats the interior surfaces of the holes in the panel stack. Finally, air <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is introduced to dry the direct metalization product material left on the walls of the holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the invention, the air <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may optionally be heated. The system further includes a valve controller and timer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to regulate each step in the described process. According to an illustrative embodiment, the cleaner, rinse fluid, and direct metalization product are recycled. After each product exits the lower plenum, a set of valves <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>direct each product to the respective reservoir. Upon completion of the deposition process, the individual panels in the panel stack are ready to be cleaned in preparation for imaging. If the panel stack is to be electroplated in stack form as described below, then the stack is not disassembled at this stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> According to an illustrative embodiment, alignment of the panel stack can be accomplished by pinning the individual panels together using one or more alignment holes along the panel edges, provided for that purpose. According to this embodiment, the alignment holes of all of the panels in the panel stack are aligned, and one or more alignment rods are inserted into the alignment holes to secure the position of each panel relative to the other panels in the panel stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, holding the panels together only along the edges may allow for some leakage of chemistry into a gap <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> between the intervening copper surfaces <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the panels, thereby compromising the efficiency of the stacked panel coating process. To attain the full potential of the direct metalization process of the present invention, means are provided for applying pressure to the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from above and below, thus inhibiting the occurrence of gaps <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. According to one embodiment, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, application of additional pressure to the stack of panels toward the center and throughout the stack surface is provided to maximize the efficiency of the deposition system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The application of pressure by means of a pressure pin ensures a compact panel stack and inhibits leakage of chemistry between individual panels. As illustrated, according to one embodiment, spring-loaded pressure pins <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be used to apply pressure from above and below the stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. According to one embodiment, the pins <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> need only be several inches apart, relying on the mechanical stiffness of the individual panels to maintain the absence of gaps between panels. According to one embodiment the spring-loaded pressure pins <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are positioned to ensure that no pins cover any holes in the circuit board, as a blocked hole would prevent the deposition chemistry from entering the holes. According to the illustrated embodiment, the pressure pins <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may optionally further include rollers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> contacting the top and bottom surfaces of the panel stack. The pressure pins are slidably coupled to the upper and lower plenum, and the rollers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> allow the pressure pins to move slightly back and forth on the surfaces. In this manner, the rollers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> ensure that no holes are permanently blocked while the chemistry is being introduced and drained from the drilled holes in the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The present invention can optionally include a pattern or &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; plate. According to one embodiment, the pattern plate can be sized to cover the top panel in the stack. The pattern plate is formed so that at least one hole corresponds to and is aligned with the through holes in the panel stack. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> illustrate the use of a pattern plate <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. The pattern plate can be mounted to the bottom surface of the upper plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, or mounted on top of the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the pattern plate <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> protects the upper surface of top panel in the stack from exposure to the chemical products of the direct metalization and electroplating process. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the pattern plate <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> may optionally also be used to prevent processing of some through holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> While the panel stack being processed in the manner described above consists of like panels with holes in alignment, the system and apparatus can be extended to accommodate several panel stacks, each containing a different set of one or more panels and therefore a different distribution of holes. By optionally stacking several of the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>assemblies previously described one on top of the other, or by the use of an intermediate housing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a tower consisting of several groups of panels can be processed at one time. Hundreds of panels can be processed in this manner in a matter of minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, the apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and described above for stacked direct metalization can be modified to provide the subsequent electroplating of the panel stack through holes in the preparation of circuit boards as well. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a direct metalization and electroplating apparatus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The apparatus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes many of the same features as the apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and further includes an electroplating system. After direct metalization, as described above, or electroless deposition, the holes of the circuit board are ready to be electroplated by pumping electrolyte from an electrolyte reservoir <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> through the through holes in a process similar to the processes wherein other chemistry is introduced to the through holes in the direct metalization example described above, utilizing a pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and a valve controller and timer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> corresponds to the electrolyte reservoir <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and controls the flow of electrolyte from the reservoir. According to a preferred embodiment, the upper plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the lower plenum <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are flooded with electrolyte fluid during the electroplating process by the use of the fluid delivery system <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The term &ldquo;electrolyte&rdquo; refers to any liquid or solid substance that while in solution or in its pure state will conduct an electric current by means of the movement of ions. Typically, an electrolyte is a solution of water and acids or metal salts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Electroplating requires an electrical connection to the through holes of the panels. One embodiment of the invention the present invention, illustrated by way of example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, provides an electrical connector <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> electrically connected to the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an anode <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> electrically connected to an electrolytic fluid <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. This embodiment of the present invention provides a continuous electrical path from the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the electrolyte <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to an anode <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, such as a copper anode. An electrical voltage is impressed between the positive anode <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The panel stack is connected via the electrical connector <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to a cathode <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to induce a negative charge on the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the panel stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is immersed in an electrolytic bath <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> between the housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The panels are held in an apparatus of the type previously described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in order to hold the stack together and to allow plating solution to be pumped through the holes. Optional pumping of electrolyte assures a continual supply of fresh plating solution to be in contact with the hole walls. There are several methods for establishing an electrical connection to the panel stack, ensuring that each panel is connected to the source of electrical current. For panels prepared for plating by direct metalization, a preferred method of plating comprises connecting an electrical connector <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, such as a conductive brush or rubber, to the individual panels, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The conductive brush or rubber is pressed against the panel edges to establish an electrical connection. By contacting an exposed copper edge at an edge of each panel of the panel stack, an electrical connection is made to each individual panel. According to an illustrative practice, the electrical connector <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, such as the conductive brush or rubber, runs the length of the stack edge to ensure that there is sufficient opportunity for the connector <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to contact every panel in the stack <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, for panels prepared for plating by electroless deposition, connection to the stack of panels can be as simple as connecting to metallic alignment pins or pressure pins used to hold the stack together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It is important to note that despite the total combined length of the superimposed holes of the panel stack, which may be several inches, stacked deposition and electroplating method of the present invention is unlike attempting to plate a hole of a similar depth in a single panel, in which a much higher throwing power would be required to accomplish the task. In the case of the stacked panels of an embodiment of the present invention, individually connected electrically plating within the holes occurs as efficiently as if each panel were separately processed in individual plating tanks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As plating current is introduced at each panel surface via the connector <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, such as a conductive brush, each hole may receive a plating current as if each panel was in an individual plating tank. According to an embodiment of the invention, electrolyte is provided throughout the plating process. The pump <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> can be configured to recirculate the plating solution to the stack structure through valve <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> after the electrolyte exits the lower plenum. Optionally, recirculation can be continuous. Since the only plating current required is that needed to plate the holes, and not the panel surfaces, the power requirements for electroplating are vastly reduced by implementing the teachings of the present invention. While there may be some preferential plating in the holes at the top and bottom of the stack of panels, a uniformity of plating through the entire stack may be achieved by providing optional additional plating current to the center of the stack as opposed to the top and bottom extremities. According to one embodiment of the invention illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, uniform plating is accomplished through the use of several connectors <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, such as brushes, which bring additional current to the desired portions of the panel stack. Desired portions may include, by way of example, the panel stack center and/or the stack top so as to reach the uniformity required. Optional circulation of plating solution to the holes further aides in the removal of any gas bubbles or debris that can potentially interfere with the plating or direct metalization processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention provides improved manufacture and preparation of circuit boards. In conventional systems, a large portion of the cleaner and direct metalization product is wasted by coming into contact with the copper surfaces of the panels being processed rather than solely with the surface of the through hole walls. Since, on average, the area of panel surface is roughly ten to twenty times the area of the totality of the through hole walls, in conventional systems, most of the chemistry is either used up or wasted on surfaces which need not be coated. According to the present invention, the cleaner and direct metalization product are introduced primarily to those surfaces requiring them, such as, for example, the hole walls, resulting in a savings in chemistry costs on the order of 90 to 95% in some applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the invention provide improvements similar to those for direct metalization in the electroplating of stacked panels, in that plating of copper can be directed primarily to the through hole walls, inhibiting copper plating from occurring on the panel surfaces. This preferential plating of the holes as compared to the panel surface reduces the amount of copper that must be etched away if panel plating is used or else allows a tent and etch process, a simpler and faster process than pattern plating without increasing the level of waste treatment involved with plating the entire panel. As the panel surfaces are not substantially exposed to the plating solution, there is no need for the various cleaning and microetching steps which normally prepare the panels for electroplating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the invention, a larger number of panels can be metalized and electroplated simultaneously than is currently possible in conventional electroplating tanks. Furthermore, the embodiments illustrated and described herein can have a smaller footprint than a conventional metalization and electroplating apparatus and be less costly to build and maintain than the current conveyorized systems that are used for direct metalization. Finally, since there are less wasted cleaner and direct metalization product, there are also fewer problems associated with waste treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Various other configurations are possible, horizontally, vertically and other angles, as well as other means of pressing the panel stack together across the end surfaces of the stack. The present invention provides for the processing of a panel stack with at least one through hole in alignment, thereby allowing the various chemistries to be employed with maximum efficiency and minimal waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> These embodiments and examples are meant to be illustrative and not limiting. The present invention has been described by way of example, and modifications and variations of the exemplary embodiments will suggest themselves to skilled artisans in this field without departing from the spirit of the invention.
