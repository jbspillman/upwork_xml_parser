<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a compact disc (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;CD&rdquo;) case made of paper, and more particularly, the present invention relates to a paper CD case which allows a CD to be easily inserted thereinto and removed therefrom, protects a data-written surface of the CD from being damaged or scratched in the course of inserting and removing the CD, and is capable of being designed to have a variety of colors and shapes, and easily recycled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a CD case for independently receiving and storing a CD is made of plastic. The plastic CD case has a base which is opened at an upper end thereof, a support frame which is detachably assembled to the base so that the CD can be rested on the support frame, and a cover which is pivotably coupled to one end of the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the plastic CD case constructed as mentioned above, a hinge part which pivotably connects the base and the cover with each other is likely to be snapped off. Also, if the plastic CD case is inadvertently dropped to a floor, or external impact is applied to the plastic CD case during handling thereof, the plastic CD case is liable to be broken into pieces due to a brittle characteristic of plastic material. Further, while a paper advertising medium which is printed with product information, etc. is put between the base and the support frame, since removal of the paper advertising medium is troublesome, it is difficult to recycle the plastic CD case. Moreover, the plastic CD case is not preferable in terms of environmental protection, due to a non-biodegradable nature of the plastic material. Furthermore, in order to form plastic CD cases having a variety of shapes, because various costly molds are needed in conformity with the shapes, a manufacturing cost is increased. By this fact, since there is no alternative but to form plastic CD cases to have a simple and uniform shape, it is impossible to fully satisfy the diverse tastes of customers. In addition, due to the fact that the plastic CD case is hard and cold to the touch, its feel is unpleasant to a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To cope with these problems of the plastic CD case, paper CD cases have been disclosed in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Since most of the conventional paper CD cases have a simple and slim pocket-shaped configuration, they are advantageous from the viewpoint of cost and recycling. However, in the conventional paper CD cases, because a CD should be pushed into or pulled out of the paper CD case upon inserting or removing the CD into or from the CD case, a data-written surface of the CD is likely to be scratched or damaged due to friction with the paper CD case, and therefore, it is a frequent occurrence that the CD recorded with costly software is ruined. Also, upon removing the CD from the paper CD case, because a finger is apt to be initially brought into contact with the data-written surface of the CD, it is difficult to adequately protect the data-written surface of the CD. Further, in a state wherein the CD is received in the conventional paper CD case, if the paper CD case is shaken, as the CD is moved in the paper CD case, the data-written surface of the CD and the paper CD case are rubbed against each other, whereby scratches can be formed on the data-written surface of the CD. Moreover, because the conventional paper CD case is formed to have a slim configuration, if impact is externally applied to the paper CD case, or a pressure is applied to the paper CD case while the paper CD case is placed on an uneven surface, since the CD is easily bent or broken, the conventional paper CD case cannot reliably perform its function of protecting the CD. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the problems occurring in the related art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a paper CD case which has a structure solid enough to prevent a CD from being broken by externally applied impact, thereby being capable of substituting the conventional CD cases made of plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a paper CD case which allows a CD to be easily inserted thereinto and removed therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still another object of the present invention is to provide a paper CD case which can be formed to have a variety of colors and shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a paper CD case which can protect a data-written surface of a CD from being damaged or scratched in the course of inserting and removing the CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a paper CD case comprising: a sleeve jacket made of paper and having an inner space which is opened at one end thereof; a holder plate made of paper for allowing a CD to be rested thereon and slidably inserted into the inner space of the sleeve jacket so that the CD rested on the holder plate is not viewed from the outside; and stopper means for limiting a moving distance of the holder plate in the sleeve jacket to a predetermined distance in a manner such that the holder plate inserted into the sleeve jacket is not completely separated from the sleeve jacket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the sleeve jacket comprises a base part and a cover part integrally connected with each other and respectively folded along a pair of folding guide lines so that they are overlapped one above the other, and a pair of wing portions respectively formed at both side ends of the cover part and folded and attached to the base part in a manner such that openings which are defined between both side ends of the base part and cover part are closed by the pair of wing portions. Consequently, the sleeve jacket has the inner space which is opened at the one end thereof and into which the holder plate can be inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also, the holder plate comprises a CD holding part and a support part integrally connected with each other and folded along folding guide lines so that they are overlapped one above the other, and a protective part formed and folded at a free end of the support part for partially covering and thereby protecting the CD rested on the holder plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that first and second projecting beads for respectively supporting non-data-written portions of the CD, which are located adjacent to inner and outer edges of the CD, are formed on the CD holding part so that a data-written surface of the CD is not brought into contact with an upper surface of the CD holding part. The first projecting bead can have a ring-shaped configuration or a disc-shaped configuration. In the case that the first projecting bead has the ring-shaped configuration, a hole which is communicated with a center hole of the CD is defined inward of the first projecting bead, and a third projecting bead is formed on the CD holding part around the hole so that the third projecting bead is inserted into the center hole of the CD to prevent the CD from being moved. Further, in the case that the first projecting bead has the disc-shaped configuration, it is preferred that a fourth projecting bead, which is to be inserted into the center hole of the CD, is formed on an upper surface of the first projecting bead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the stopper means comprises a first hook portion which is formed at a free end of the cover part and folded in such a way as to be positioned in the inner space of the sleeve jacket, and a second hook portion which is formed at a boundary region between the CD holding part and the support part in a manner such that the second hook portion is cut from the boundary region at three sides thereof and folded at one side thereof, the second hook portion being engaged with the first hook portion when the holder plate is pulled out of the sleeve jacket and thereby restraining the holder plate from being completely separated from the sleeve jacket. The stopper means may further comprise third and fourth hook portions which are formed and folded at both side ends of the CD holding part so that they are engaged with the first hook portion along with the second hook portion when the holder plate is pulled out of the sleeve jacket and thereby restrain the holder plate from being completely separated from the sleeve jacket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that first and second notch portions are formed at free ends of the cover part and base part which free ends define the opened one end of the sleeve jacket in a manner such that the holder plate inserted into the sleeve jacket can be easily grasped by fingers. A tab portion may be formed, by cutting, on the support part of the holder plate at a position where the support part is exposed to the outside through the first notch portion, in a manner such that slippage of fingers upon grasping the holder plate is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is preferred that a pair of third and forth notch portions are formed at both side ends of the CD holding part and the support part in a manner such that it is possible to easily grasp both sides of the CD rested on the holder plate without undergoing any interference.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in greater detail to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention includes a sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed in a manner such that a CD C is removably loaded thereon. The holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is slidably inserted into the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are made of paper material such as millboard, corrugated paperboard, special paper, and the like, which has a relatively solid structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be formed by folding paper material which is cut to have a predetermined shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. That is to say, the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a base part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which are integrally connected with each other and respectively folded along a pair of folding guide lines L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that they are overlapped one above the other. A pair of wing portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are respectively formed at both side ends of the cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and folded and attached to an inner surface of the base part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a manner such that openings which are defined between both side ends of the base part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are closed by the pair of wing portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, whereby an inner space, which is opened at one end thereof, is defined in the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Concretely speaking, as the pair of wing portions <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are folded also along folding guide lines, a vertical wall portion <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed between each pair of folding guide lines. Therefore, due to the presence of vertical wall portions <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed in this way, the inner space, which has a predetermined height and is opened at the one end thereof, is defined in the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on or from which the CD C can be loaded or unloaded can be slidably inserted into the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the opened one end. Thus, the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> functions to protect the CD C. In this regard, it is to be readily understood that a supplement such as an explanatory note, etc. can be received in the inner space of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be formed by folding paper material which is cut to have a preselected shape as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. That is to say, the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a support part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are integrally connected with each other and respectively folded along a pair of folding guide lines L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so that they are overlapped one above the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is formed and folded at a free end of the support part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to partially cover and thereby protect the CD C which is rested on the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is folded along a pair of folding guide lines, a vertical wall portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which has the same height as the inner space of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is formed. Due to the fact that the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is supported by the vertical wall portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> ensures that a height of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> inserted into the inner space of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is appropriately adjusted, and at the same time, prevents the CD C from being exposed to the outside of the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Because the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is exposed to the outside when the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pulled outward from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, outer surfaces of the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and vertical wall portion <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be printed with letters or images which explain contents of the CD C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has substantially a circular outline and a size for allowing the CD C to be loaded thereon, and functions to protect the CD C in the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, it is preferred that first and second projecting beads <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for respectively supporting non-data-written portions of the CD C, which are located adjacent to inner and outer edges of the CD C, are formed on an upper surface of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, since only the non-data-written portions of the CD C are respectively brought into contact with the first and second projecting beads <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a data-written surface of the CD C is not brought into contact with the upper surface of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, when loading or unloading the CD C on or from the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, it is possible to prevent the data-written surface of the CD C from being inadvertently rubbed against the upper surface of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Hence, the data-written surface of the CD C is prevented from being damaged or scratched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The first projecting bead <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can have a ring-shaped configuration or a disc-shaped configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the case that the first projecting bead <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has the ring-shaped configuration, it is preferred that a hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which is communicated with a center hole C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the CD C is defined inward of the first projecting bead <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. A third projecting bead <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> can be further formed on the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> directly around the hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> so that the third projecting bead <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is inserted into the center hole C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the CD C to prevent the CD C from being moved. As can be readily seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> can be defined in a manner such that it has a diameter which is greater than that of the center hole C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and in this case, the third projecting bead <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> also supports the non-data-written surface of the CD C. If the hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is defined, when unloading the CD C from the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, because it is possible to insert the index finger into the center hole C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the CD C and the hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and grasp the outer edge of the CD C by the thumb, the data-written surface of the CD C can be stably protected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case that the first projecting bead <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> has the disc-shaped configuration, it is preferred that a fourth projecting bead <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which is to be inserted into the center hole C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the CD C, is formed on an upper surface of the first projecting bead <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. In this case, since the CD C is prevented from being moved leftward or rightward by the presence of the fourth projecting bead <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, upon handling the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the CD C is received, the CD C can be further stably protected, which is facilitated by the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the present invention, the second projecting bead <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be formed to have a shape of a ring which is discontinued at several points. The projecting beads <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be formed by an embossing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, one of characterizing features of the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to present invention is in that the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> inserted into the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pulled outward from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> only to the extent allowing the CD C to be loaded on or unloaded from the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and stopper means S (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is provided to prevent the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from being completely separated from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In other words, describing an example of the stopper means S for preventing complete separation of the holding plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed at a free end of the cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and folded in such a way as to be positioned in the inner space of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Also, a second hook portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is formed at a boundary region between the support part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a manner such that the second hook portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is cut from the boundary region at three sides thereof and folded at one side thereof. The second hook portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is engaged with the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pulled outward from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and thereby restrains the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from being completely separated from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition, third and fourth hook portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> can be further formed and folded at both side ends of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so that they are engaged with the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> along with the second hook portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> when the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pulled outward from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and thereby restrain the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from being completely separated from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The second hook portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the third hook portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the fourth hook portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are formed along a circumference of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in such a way as to extend toward the inside of the inner space of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and thereby function to hold, in cooperation with the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the CD C in place and prevent the CD C from being moved even when the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shaken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As the second hook portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the third hook portion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the fourth hook portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are located along a curved path, both side ends of the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be curvedly or inclinedly formed, and a free end of the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be formed to define a circular arc-shaped outline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the meanwhile, it is preferred that grasping means for enabling the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> inserted into the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be easily grasped is formed in the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Namely, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, as an example of the grasping means for allowing the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be easily grasped, first and second notch portions <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be formed by cutting away portions adjacent to free ends of the base part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which free ends define the opened one end of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this case, because the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is formed at the free end of the cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is folded to be positioned in the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the second notch portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed in a manner such that the second notch portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>directly faces the first notch portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the base part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> even when the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is folded with respect to the cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. To this end, a circle or an ellipse is defined by punching at a boundary area between the cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the paper material which is cut as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that a tab portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is further formed by partially cutting the support part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at a position where the support part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is exposed to the outside through the first notch portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the base part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, in a manner such that the index finger is prevented from being slipped on the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> upon grasping and pulling outward the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by inserting the index finger through the first notch portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the tab portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is cut in the form of a semicircle or to have a U-shaped outline. When the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is grasped by the index finger to be pulled outward from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as the tab portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is pressed inward by the index finger, firm grasping of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is guaranteed. The tab portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> also allows the left and right, top and bottom, and front and rear of holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be easily confirmed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, another grasping means for enabling the CD C to be easily grasped in obedience to a habit of a user can be formed in the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As an example of this grasping means which is formed in the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, a pair of third notch portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are formed at both side ends of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a manner such that it is possible to easily grasp both sides of the CD C rested on the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> without undergoing any interference. Also, the support part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be formed with a pair of fourth notch portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a manner such that the pair of fourth notch portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>correspond to the pair of third notch portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively. These third and fourth notch portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>ensure that the outer edge of the CD C can be easily grasped using the thumb and middle finger to load or unload the CD C on or from the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, whereby the data-written surface of the CD C is prevented from being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, it is preferable to print or coat portions of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which portions are exposed to the outside. Also, in order to protect the data-written surface of the CD C, it is preferable to coat a portion of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which portion is exposed to the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Describing a manufacturing procedure of the paper CD case according to the present invention, constructed as mentioned above, as can be readily seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, after cutting paperboard material in the form of the deployed sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the deployed holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, by folding the cut paperboard material, the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be independently prepared as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Then, after the CD C is loaded on the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted into the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Upon pulling outward the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to unload the CD C from the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or to receive the CD C into the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is grasped by inserting the fingers into the first and second notch portions <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At this time, as the tab portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pressed inward by the finger which is inserted into the first notch portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is firmly grasped by the fingers. By this fact, upon pulling outward the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, slippage of the fingers on the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is prevented, whereby it is possible to conveniently pull outward the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> By pulling outward the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in this way, the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is slid out of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At this time, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, when the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pulled from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a predetermined distance, the second hook portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is engaged with the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the third and fourth hook portions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are engaged with the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, since the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> cannot be further pulled out of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not completely separated from the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When pulling of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is stopped, the CD C can be loaded on or unloaded from the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. That is to say, by unfolding the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the CD C can be loaded on or unloaded from the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the case that the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is defined with the hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, depending upon a habit of a user, one finger can be inserted into the hole <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and another finger can grasp a portion of the outer edge of the CD C which portion is positioned in the third and fourth notch portions <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to unload the CD C from the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This applies in the same manner upon loading the CD C on the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In the present invention, during handling of the CD C, since the data-written surface of the CD C is not rubbed against the upper surface of the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> owing to the presence of the first and second projecting beads <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the data-written surface of the CD C is prevented from being scratched or damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, upon storing the CD C, after loading the CD C on the CD holding part <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, by pushing the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted into the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a state wherein the hook portions <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are engaged with the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the support part <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is supported by the base part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Then, as the hook portions <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are disengaged from the first hook portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the hook portions <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are moved in a state wherein they are brought into contact with a lower surface of the cover part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). Thus, by the presence of the hook portions <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> and the protective part <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the holder plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be smoothly pulled out of and pushed into the sleeve jacket <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, while the CD C is stored in this way, even though the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shaken, the CD C is not moved in the paper CD case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is further facilitated by the application of the fourth projecting bead <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As apparent from the above descriptions, the paper CD case according to the present invention, constructed as mentioned above, provides advantages in that, since the CD case is made of paper, it is possible to form, at a reduced cost, CD cases to have a variety of colors and shapes, in obedience to the diverse tastes of customers. Also, by performing a coating treatment for the paper CD case according to the present invention, the paper CD case can be made pleasant to the touch, and valuableness of the paper CD case can be increased. Also, since recycling of the paper CD case is possible, the paper CD case is superior to the conventional plastic CD case in terms of environmental protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Further, because the paper CD case has a solid structure for substituting the conventional plastic CD case, even when the paper CD case is inadvertently dropped to a floor, or a load is externally applied to the paper CD case placed on an uneven surface, the paper CD case is hardly deformed and is prevented from being damaged or broken into pieces, other than the conventional plastic CD case. Therefore, the paper CD case according to the present invention can reliably perform its function of protecting a CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the present invention, because a data-written surface of the CD is protected, by virtue of first and second projecting beads, from being scratched or damaged during handling of the CD, and the CD is prevented, by virtue of a protective part, hook portions and a fourth projecting bead, from being moved in the paper CD case even when the paper CD case is shaken, CD protection is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, by the fact that a holder plate is not completely separated from a sleeve jacket and instead partially drawn to a predetermined position, when considering the conventional situation where a holder plate is completely separated from a sleeve jacket upon removing a CD, it is convenient to use and handle the paper CD case according to the present invention, and the CD can be easily inserted into and removed from the paper CD case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the case that paper CD cases according to the present invention are stored in a state wherein they are vertically received in a CD rack or horizontally arranged in a CD box, it is not necessary to completely remove each paper CD case as a whole from the CD rack or box, and instead, it is sufficient to partially pull the holder plate out of the sleeve jacket to unload the CD from the paper CD case, whereby user convenience is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>
