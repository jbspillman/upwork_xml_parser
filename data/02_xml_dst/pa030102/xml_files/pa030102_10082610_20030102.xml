<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A tubular body or mandrel incorporated into a string of tubular pipe, on which first and second swab cups and first and second metal brushes and a casing scraper are mounted, is run into a cased earth borehole to displace a first fluid in the borehole, usually a drilling fluid, with a second fluid, usually either a completion fluid or a workover fluid. In a first embodiment, reverse circulation, in which the second fluid is pumped into the borehole annulus above the swab cups and/or the metal brushes, and in which the first fluid is thereby pumped back towards the earth&apos;s surface through the interior of the string of tubular pipe, causes displacement of the first fluid merely by lowering the string of pipe while pumping the second fluid into the borehole annulus. In a second embodiment, using normal circulation, the first fluid is pumped from the earth&apos;s surface downwardly through the interior of the string of tubular pipe into the borehole annulus between the pair of swab cups, and/or between the metal brushes. The first fluid is then displaced from the preselected zone of the cased borehole by raising or lowering the string of tubular pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0002" lvl="0">In an alternative embodiment, the tubular pipe, upon which the swab cups and the brushes and the casing scrapers are mounted, is pulled out of the riser or cased borehole to displace the undesired fluid in the riser or cased borehole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0003" lvl="0">In yet another embodiment, a plurality of large swab cups are shearingly secured to the tubular body and a plurality of smaller swab cups are secured to the tubular body, which also includes one or more spring-loaded casing scrapers mounted below the smaller swab cups, thereby allowing the apparatus to be used in progressively smaller diameter casing during the same operation of the apparatus. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates, generally, to new and improved methods and apparatus using mechanical separation between the drilling fluid and the displacement fluids, and specifically, to the use of swab cups and/or metal brushes to mechanically separate the drilling fluid from the displacement fluids, in combination with a casing scraper to remove debris from the inner wall of the casing or other tubular members. The method and apparatus can also be used to clean up downhole fluids, and can be used to wipe and brush well casing and completion risers clean, even with varying internal diameters. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the art of the completion and/or the workover of oil and gas wells to displace the drilling fluid with a completion fluid or a workover fluid. A workover fluid will typically be either a surface cleaning fluid, such as an acid, to clean out the perforations in the casing, or a formation treating chemical which can be used with proppants to prop open the formation. The completion fluid will typically be a clear, heavy brine such as calcium chloride, calcium bromide or zinc bromide, or various combinations of such heavy brines. The density of such clear brines is generally selected and controlled to ensure that the hydrostatic head or pressure of the fluid in the wellbore will match the hydrostatic pressure of the column of drilling fluid being displaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Displacement &ldquo;spacers&rdquo;, as they are commonly named, are used between the drilling fluid and the completion fluid, and these are typically formulated from specific chemicals designed for the specific base drilling fluid being displaced, and will typically include weighted or unweighted barrier spacers, viscous barrier spacers, flocculating spacers, and casing cleaning chemicals, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is well known in this art that complete displacement of the drilling fluids is critical to the success of completion and/or workover operations. It is extremely important that the brines not be mixed with the drilling fluid itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, there are two principal displacement methods, viz., direct and indirect. The choice between direct and indirect has depended upon casing-tubing strengths, cement bond log results, and exposure of the formation of interest. If the cement bond logs and the casing strength data indicate that the casing would withstand a calculated pressure differential, i.e., that the casing would not rupture, and that the formation of interest is not exposed, the conventional technique has been that of indirect displacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a typical indirect displacement, large volumes of sea water are used to flush the drilling fluid out of the well. When applying the flushing method, however, it is very important that the pressure of the salt water flush not exceed the pressure which would burst the casing being flushed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Direct displacement of the drilling fluid, used by those in this art whenever there are pressure problems or the formation of interest is exposed, uses chemical agents and weighted fluids to clean the wellbore and to separate the drilling fluid from the workover/completion fluid. Because a constant hydrostatic pressure is maintained, pressure problems are eliminated. Direct displacement is normally used when (1) casing and tubulars cannot withstand the pressures associated with the indirect displacement procedure; (2) when the formation of interest is exposed; (3) if a source of flushing water, typically salt water, is not readily available; or (4) in the event of disposal and discharge restraints being imposed on the particular well or group of wells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A common element to both the direct and indirect displacement procedures is the use of barriers and cleaning chemicals (&ldquo;spacers&rdquo;) for effective hole cleaning and separation between the drilling fluid and the completion/workover fluid. The primary purpose of a barrier spacer is to provide a complete separation between the drilling fluid and the completion/workover fluid. In such prior art systems, the spacer fluid must be compatible with both the drilling fluid and the workover/completion fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, to the best of applicant&apos;s knowledge, the prior art has not had the ability to displace the drilling fluid with a workover/completion fluid without using a spacer fluid between the drilling fluid and the workover/completion fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is also well known in this art to use casing scrapers to clean-off the interior wall of a downhole casing, but typically, cannot use the same tool in cleaning casing strings or other tubular members of varying diameters. The following prior art United States patents show various combinations of casing scrapers and/or swab cups, but none of such patents, taken alone or in combination, show or suggest the combination of the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Gibson U.S. Pat. No. 2,362,198: This shows a casing scraper (brush) in combination with swab cups <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and the flow of various fluids (water, circulation fluid or cement) through the hollow rod <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This device is meant to vertically reciprocate to clean the interior of casing, but does not suggest using the swab cups as a mechanical separation of the drilling fluid and the completion fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Hodges U.S. Pat. No. 2,652,120: This shows a casing scraper <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a seal ring <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (an inflatable packer instead of a swab cup) and a reciprocating rod <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to create a suction which cleans out the perforations <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the casing (see Col. 3, lines 48-68 concerning its operation). The patent does not suggest the concept of mechanical separation of the fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Hodges U.S. Pat. No. 2,687,774: This is related to Hodges U.S. Pat. No. 2,652,120, discussed above, and is of no additional relevance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Keltner U.S. Pat. No. 2,825,411: This shows a swabbing device which includes a typical chemical cleaning process in conjunction with the reciprocating swabbing process. (See Col. 6, lines 1-11 for the chemical cleaning process.) There is no suggestion of mechanically separating the completion fluid from the drilling fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Maly, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,637,010: This is of very little, if any, relevance, showing packers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) in a gravel packing operation in horizontal wells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Jenkins U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,354: This shows a casing scraper with blades <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a packer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> supported by a tubing string <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a drill bit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at its lower end, all within the casing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The production packer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is apparently anchored to the casing wall independently of the downward movement of the tubing string <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This patent does not suggest the concept involving the mechanical separation of the fluids. In fact, as the pumped fluid exits the drill bit, the fluid returns back through the annulus <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> between the tubing string <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the inner tubular member <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> passing through the interior of the packer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

Knife blade <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> functions as a scraper between the chevron packings <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Once the chevron packings have isolated the perforations in the casing, fluid is pumped out of openings <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in the mandrel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to clean out the perforations. </paragraph>

No. 4,921,046: This shows a cleanup tool for cleaning the interior of a casing string having a packer cup <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for sealing the tool to the casing wall, and which pumps clean out fluid out through the port <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> into the casing below the packer cup. The debris is then picked up by the pumped fluid and pumped into the lower end of the mandrel <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and pumped back to the earth&apos;s surface. This does not suggest a mechanical separation of the completion fluid and the drilling fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Jenkins U.S. Pat. No. 5,076,365: This is the same disclosure as U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,354, discussed above, and the same comments apply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Ferguson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,119,874: This well clean out system is used to pump sand and other debris out of the bottom of a producing well, but aside from using swab cups, has essentially no relevance to the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is therefore the primary object of the present invention to provide new and improved methods and apparatus for displacing the drilling fluid in a wellbore with one or more completion and/or workover fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved cleaning and/or wiping of the interior of drilling and completion risers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide new and improved separation of the drilling fluid from one or more completion and/or workover fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide new and improved methods and apparatus for cleaning the interior surfaces of casing strings or other tubular members having progressively smaller internal diameters as a function of depth of the casing in earth boreholes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed, generally, to methods and apparatus which employ a plurality of swab cups integrally located within a string of tubular pipe, positioned within a cased earth borehole, or within a drilling or completion riser, and having drilling fluid located on one side of the plurality of swab cups and the workover fluid or the completion fluid located on the other side of the plurality of swab cups, resulting in a mechanical separation of the drilling fluid and the workover/completion fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one mode of the invention, the tubular is lowered into the cased wellbore, typically loaded with drilling fluid, with the completion/workover fluid being pumped behind the plurality of swab cups. This action forces the drilling fluid to be pumped from the wellbore through the interior of the tubular back near or to the earth&apos;s surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As an additional feature of the invention, a mechanical scraper is run below the swab cups to help clean the interior of the well casing and to prevent or lessen any damage to the swab cups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the displacement fluid is located between a pair of swab cups and the drilling fluid located in the borehole annulus other than between the pair of swab cups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the combination swab cup and scraper assembly is run to the desired depth in the cased wellbore, or riser, and then pulled out of the hole, bringing the drilling fluid or other fluid to be displaced towards the earth&apos;s surface by taking returns up the annulus, with that portion of the cased borehole, or the riser, below the assembly being back-filled with the displacement fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, one or more metal brushes, either with or without one or more swab cups are used to mechanically separate one fluid from another and to displace one fluid with the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As a special feature of the invention, the tool includes swab cups of varying external diameters, in which at least one or more of them are sheared upon meeting decreased diameter tubulars, allowing the tool to be used in varying diameter tubulars. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring now specifically to the drawings, and first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a drilling rig <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> disposed atop a borehole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An MWD instrument <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, commonly used to provide measurements while drilling, but which are not required for the present invention, is carried by a sub <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, typically a drill collar, incorporated into a drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and disposed within the borehole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A drill bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is located at the lower end of the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and carves a borehole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the earth formations <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Drilling mud <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is pumped from a storage reservoir pit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> near the wellhead <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, down an axial passageway (not shown) through the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, out of apertures in the bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and back to the surface through the annular region <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, usually referred to as the annulus. Metal surface casing <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is positioned in the borehole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> above the drill bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for maintaining the integrity of the upper portion of the borehole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in which the drilling fluid is pumped down through the interior of the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, out through the bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and back to the earth&apos;s surface via the annulus <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, there is thus described so-called &ldquo;normal circulation&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a method commonly used in the prior art, still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the borehole, and the drill bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> removed from the end of the drill string. A string of steel casing is run into the well at least down to the formation which is believed to contain oil and/or gas. At this point in time, the cased borehole will typically still contain some volume of drilling fluid. The drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is then run back into the wellbore until its lower end is below the formation of interest. A spacer fluid, discussed above as usually including various chemicals for cleaning the interior of the casing, is pumped down the interior of the drill string, theoretically causing the drilling fluid to be displaced and pumped toward the earth&apos;s surface through the annulus <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The completion or workover fluid is then pumped down the interior of the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, displacing the spacer fluid, and causing the spacer fluid to be pumped towards the earth&apos;s surface, all as is conventional and well known in this art. This, of course, can be problematic in that the three (3) fluids, i.e., the drilling fluid, the spacer fluid and the completion fluid often times tend to mix, rather than continue as three discrete, separated fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the &ldquo;reverse circulation&rdquo; mode of operation, illustrated diagrammatically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the mud pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected such that its output pumps mud (drilling fluid) into and along the annulus <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and then into the lower end of the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and ultimately back to the earth&apos;s surface, all of which is well recognized and understood by those skilled in the art of drilling oil and gas wells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the reverse circulation mode, the mud pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has its output connected through a line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into the annulus <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. If desired, a packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is set below the open end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to isolate the portion of the wellbore above the packer from the portion of the wellbore below the packer. The interior of the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected through a fluid line <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> back to the mud tank <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The fluid line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, connected into the mud tank <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is connected to the fluid input of mud pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that most drilling operations use the normal circulation system embodied in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, although some wells have been drilled using the reverse circulation mode of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in which the drilling fluid is pumped down the annulus <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, through the drill bit (not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and up through the interior of the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> back to the mud pit <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> containing the drilling fluid <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring further to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, once it has been determined from well logs, earth core samples and the like, that a potential oil and/or gas zone has been identified at a given depth in the formation, for example, the zone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, steel casing <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is positioned in the wellbore, and the process begins for displacing the drilling fluid with completion fluid, typically a clear, heavy brine as above discussed. Once the interior of the casing string has been cleaned, and the completion fluid is in place, the casing can be perforated by explosive charges, for example, with bullets or shaped charges, all of which are conventional and well known in this art, and the oil and/or gas in the producing zone, if any, can be produced through the perforations into the wellbore and pumped to the earth&apos;s surface through conventional means, for example, through production tubing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In providing the displacement fluids, if done in the conventional mode, the drilling fluid in mud tank <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is cleaned out and replaced by a spacer fluid, above discussed and usually containing chemical cleaning fluids. After the spacer is pumped in, the spacer fluid is cleaned out of the mud pit <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and replaced with the completion fluid, which is then pumped in to displace the spacer fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> sub <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is incorporated into the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. The sub <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is actually a pair of subs <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which together substitute for the drill collar <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Sub <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has a pair of conventional, elastomeric swab cups <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> having diameters chosen to enable the swabbing of the casing <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Sub <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has a pair of conventional casing scrapers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> having diameters chosen to enable the cleaning of the interior wall of casing <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. The swab cups <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, as well as the casing scrapers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, are well known in the art and thus require nothing more than a diagrammatic illustration and description. The upper sub <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (closer to the earth&apos;s surface in use) may have a male pin <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> for connection into the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, whereas the lower sub <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may have a female lower end <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> for receiving any additional subs below the sub <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the system in accord with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, after the potential producing zone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has been identified with well logs, core samples, etc., and the steel casing <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> set in the borehole, the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having the subs <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is prepared for running back into the borehole. At this point in time, the drilling fluid in mud pit <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> has been replaced with completion fluid and is ready to be pumped into the annulus <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> immediately on top of the top surface <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> of swab cup <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. As the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is lowered into the borehole, the completion fluid is pumped into the annulus <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to maintain the annulus above the swab cups full of the completion fluid. As the swab cups <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> move down in the cased borehole, drilling fluid in the borehole is forced through the open end <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the lowermost sub, through a one-way check valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and back towards the earth&apos;s surface through the interior fluid channel of the drill string. The check valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> prevents the displaced fluid from coming back into the wellbore. Depending upon the volume of the displaced drilling fluid, the drilling fluid can either be pumped back into the mud pit <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> or into a second mud pit (not illustrated) to avoid mixing the returned drilling fluid and the completion fluid at the earth&apos;s surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> By having the casing scrapers <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> below the swab cups <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the casing scraper will remove most, if not all of the buildup on the casing wall which might otherwise destroy or lessen the efficiency of the elastomeric swab cups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Once the swab cups have been lowered below the portion of the casing <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> covering the planned production zone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, all of the drilling fluid will have been displaced from the borehole opposite the production zone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, as by pushing or pulling the fluid being displaced, and the completion, workover or other desired operation through the casing <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> opposite the zone <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be accomplished. If the task involves completion, the drill string <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (or production tubing if desired) can include a conventional perforation sub <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> such as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which sub <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could include bullet guns or shaped charges, all of which is well know in the art as Tubing Conveyed Perforation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> There has thus been illustrated and described methods and apparatus which provide a mechanical separation of the drilling fluid being displaced, from the displacement fluid, typically a completion or workover fluid, thus providing an improvement over the problematic task of pumping three dissimilar fluids through a common fluid channel while attempting to maintain a reasonable separation of the three fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred embodiment contemplates using reverse circulation because of being easier to mechanically separate the drilling fluid from the completion or workover fluid, obvious modifications to the preferred embodiment will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present invention in which normal circulation is used. The drill string (or other tubular) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a pair of swab cups <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as well as a casing scraper <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The drill string <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is illustrated as being positioned in an earth borehole <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> into which steel casing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has already been run in. A packer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is run in as an option to isolate the portion of the borehole <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> above the packer from that portion of the borehole <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> below the packer. The packer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can have a surface-controlled fluid bypass if desired to allow drilling fluid to be pumped below the packer as needed. The lower end of the drill string <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a plug <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to prevent the displacement fluid from being pumped out of the lower end of tubular <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and thus prevents the mixing of the drilling fluid with the completion fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Located intermediate the swab cubs <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is at least one orifice <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, but preferably a plurality of orifices <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. One or more fluid conduits <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are connected between swab cups <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and to allow drilling fluid within the borehole <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to bypass the swab cups as the drill string <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is raised or lowered in the borehole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as the drill string <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is to be lowered into the wellbore <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from the earth&apos;s surface, the interior of the drill string <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is filled with the completion fluid. The completion fluid also exits the one or more orifices <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> into the annulus <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> located between the swab cups <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The drill string <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be lowered or raised to cause the completion fluid to be adjacent the potential producing zone <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to allow the desired operation to take place, i.e., perforation of the casing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, workover, etc. If the tubular <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is production tubing, the casing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be perforated from a perforation gun, or an array of shaped charges carried by the production tubing, all of which is conventional and well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For ease of presentation, the displacement fluid has, for the most part, been described herein as being a completion fluid. However, the apparatus and methods described herein are applicable to any downhole system in which one fluid is displacing another, and in which separation of the two fluids is desired. For example, when workover fluids are being used on the formation of interest, it is fairly common to replace the drilling fluid, or whatever other fluid is in the wellbore, e.g., water or hydrocarbons produced from the formation, with such workover fluids. Workover fluids are well known in the art, for example, as described in <highlight><italic>Composition and Properties of Oil Well Drilling Fluids</italic></highlight>, Fourth Edition, by George R. Gray et al., at pages 476-525. Another fluid which may be used to displace the fluid in the borehole is the so-called packer fluid, also discussed in that same reference on pages 476-525. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> hollow steel riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> extending from the earth&apos;s surface (not illustrated) or from an offshore platform (not illustrated) used in the drilling, completion, workover and/or production of oil and gas wells, is illustrated as having a blowout preventer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (BOP), which typically would be a conventional Ram BOP having one or more hydraulic lines <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, extending to the earth&apos;s surface or to an offshore platform, which are used to open and close its rams. A pair of choke and kill lines <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> also extend either to the earth&apos;s surface or to the offshore platform, as the case may be, and which allow fluid to be pumped into the interior of the riser at inlets <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, respectively. Although it is common practice to install the choke and kill lines below the BOP, this particular embodiment contemplates the choke and kill lines being installed above the BOP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A steel tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, for example, a steel drill pipe, is illustrated as run into the interior of the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the earth&apos;s surface or an offshore platform, and includes a one-way check valve <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> allowing fluid within the tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> to be pumped down through the tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in the direction shown by arrow <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The tubular carries a scraper <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, for example, a steel brush for mechanically cleaning the interior surface of the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and can be spring-loaded, if desired, to maintain contact with the wall of the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> carries one or more swab cups <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, preferably of the type which are activated by fluid pressure exerted on their lower surfaces <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, respectively, to engage the interior wall of the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The swab cups <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> can be either the type of cups which can be activated, i.e., pressed against the interior wall of the riser, by pressure exerted against their lower surfaces, or by pressure exerted against their upper surfaces, viz., by the hydrostatic pressure of the mud column in the riser to be pumped out of the riser, or can be a combination of such swab cups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> also carries a jetting unit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and bull plug <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> at its lower end to allow cleaning fluid to be pumped through the valve <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and out through the many holes <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> in the jetting unit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> into the interior of the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is raised enough to cause the jetting unit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and bull plug to come out of the open BOP <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The rams of the BOP are then closed, preventing any fluid from being pumped below the BOP. The choke and kill lines are then activated, putting hydraulic pressure underneath the swab cups <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is thus pumped out of the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as hydraulic pressure is maintained against the lower surfaces <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of swap cups <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, respectively, preferably while mechanically lifting the tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> from the earth&apos;s surface or an offshore platform. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in which the choke and kill lines <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> are located beneath the BOP <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the choke and kill lines <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may or may not even be present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A plug <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, for example, an inflatable packer, is run in and set within the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> below the BOP <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As soon as the tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> has been lowered to the desired depth in the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the choke and kill lines <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> are activated, putting the hydraulic pressure on the lower surfaces <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> of swab cups <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, respectively. This causes tubular <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> to be pumped out of the riser <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as with the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, but without closing the rams in the BOP <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Moreover, whether using the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, one can practice the invention without using the choke and kill lines, merely by either closing the BOP or by setting the plug, and pumping fluid down through the tubular, creating hydraulic pressure against the bottom surfaces of the swab cups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> This is not preferred, however, because this causes the tubular to be pulled while fluid is being pumped through it, sometimes referred to as pulling a &ldquo;wet string&rdquo;. Those skilled in this art know, however, that by using a &ldquo;mud bucket&rdquo; (not illustrated), the wet string problem can be essentially circumvented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a casing string <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> having a lower section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of a given internal diameter and an upper section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of an internal diameter greater than said given diameter. A tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> according to the present invention is run through the interior of the casing string by manipulating a tubular string <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> from the earth&apos;s surface, either by lowering or raising the string <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> includes a conventional annular pressure relief valve <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, a conventional swivel joint <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, a first pair of swab cups <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, a second pair of swab cups <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, as well as a plurality of spring-loaded casing scrapers or brushes <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The first pair of swab cups <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> each have an external diameter large enough to swab the internal diameter of the casing section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The second pair of swab cups <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> each have an external diameter large enough to swab the internal diameter of the reduced diameter casing section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The plurality of spring-loaded casing scrapers <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> are in their expanded mode to scrape and clean the internal diameter of the casing section <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, but will compress to scrape and clean the internal diameter of the casing section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, as the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is lowered into the casing section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> being lowered into the reduced diameter casing section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the compression of the spring-loaded casing scrapers <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to fit within the reduced diameter casing section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates the first, upper pair of swab cups <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> being sheared away from the tubular body or mandrel <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> of the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> upon coming into contact with the upper end <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> of the reduced diameter casing section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and resting upon the upper end <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> as the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is lowered further into the casing section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates but one example of how the swab cups <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> are sheared away from the tubular mandrel <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> of the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The swab cup <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> has a sleeve <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, preferably manufactured from metal or hard plastic, sized to slide over the exterior surface of the mandrel <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. A plurality of shear pins, illustrated by the pair of shear pins <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight>, are used to hold the swab cup <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> secured in place on the mandrel <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. The shear pins are selected to shear at pre-selected values, but should be selected to be of high enough value so as not to shear due to fluid pressure exerted upon the swab cups during the operation of the tool. For example, without limiting the intended use, if the swab cup <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> is expected to be exposed to 1000 psi fluid pressure, the shear pins could be selected to shear at 1500 psi and avoid shearing due to the fluid pressure. Moreover, there may be times in the operation of the apparatus <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> such that the casing scrapers <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, which can be spring-loaded steel brushes if desired, do not clean out the debris properly, and an obstruction can exist in the casing. Such an obstruction could cause a premature shearing of one or more swab cups. A conventional device, commonly referred to as a &lsquo;no-go&rsquo; device, can be mounted on the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which functions to stop the further lowering of the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to protect the shearable swab cups, in the event of the &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; device encountering such an obstruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the operation of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, as the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is lowered in the casing string until the swab cup <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the surface <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, the further lowering of the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> causes the shear pins <highlight><bold>363</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> to shear, as well as the shear pins in swab cup <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> (not illustrated but identical to those used in swab cup <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>), causing the swab cups <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> to rest upon the surface <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This process allows the smaller swab cups <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, and the spring-loaded scraper <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to be further lowered into the smaller casing section <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> All of the operations described above with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can also be done with the tools illustrated and described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates the tool <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> being moved up and out of the casing string. If it is desired to move fluid out of the casing, it should be appreciated that the large swab cups <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> merely rest upon the smaller swab cups <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and as the tubular string <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> is pulled up, the swab cups <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> push the fluid in the casing all the way up in the casing string to the earth&apos;s surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> While FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> show the use of a pair of large swab cups and a pair of smaller swab cups in only two sizes of casing, the invention is intended to also be used with three or more different sizes of casing, since the typical oil and gas well is cased progressively smaller with depth in the earth borehole. Although not preferred, the invention contemplates the use of one, two, three or more swab cups of a given size, diameter, or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a tubular string <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> being run within the interior of a casing or riser string <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and having a first swab cup <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, a second swab cup <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, a first metal brush <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, a second metal brush <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and a spring-loaded casing scraper <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> If desired, the swab cups <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> can be four such swab cups such as are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in which two are of one diameter to allow being used in varying diameter casing or riser strings. Also, the brushes <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be of a varying number, for example, a single brush, or maybe three or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The brushes <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be of various configurations, and the bristles, preferably of steel or other metal, may be more densely or less densely configured to control the flow of the fluid being displaced. Flow paths of varying designs and of varying widths can be cut or other configured in the exterior to either allow no fluid, or controlled amounts of fluid to bypass such brushes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> ** If desired, the swab cups <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> can be eliminated, and the brush <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and/or the brush <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can be used to displace the fluid of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In operation, much like the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the assembly of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is pushed downwardly through the casing or riser <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> with the tubular string <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The spring-loaded casing scraper cleans much of the interior of the casing <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The brush <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and or the brush <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> provide additional cleaning of the inside surface of the casing <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and also push the fluid and debris from the cleaned casing interior ahead of the brush or brushes, back into the interior of the tubular string <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, and back the earth&apos;s surface, or alternatively, to the bottom of the cased borehole. If the one or more swab cups such as the swab cups <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> are used, such cup or cups provide additional mechanical separation of the fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Further in the operation of the various methods and apparatus described and illustrated herein, it is intended that first and second metal brushes can be substituted for the first and second swab cups in each of the embodiments illustrated and described herein, and all such substitutions are intended to be covered by the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> There has thus been described herein methods and apparatus for displacing the borehole fluid with another fluid, in selected portions of risers, or of cased earth boreholes. However, it will be understood that changes in the illustrated and described embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit of my invention, the scope of which is set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
