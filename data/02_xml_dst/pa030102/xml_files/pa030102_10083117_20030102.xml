<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCPRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This invention is a round plate consisted by one upper disk (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and one subjacent disk (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) folding together. These two disks are separately divided into <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> blocks by two central cutting lines (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) and the fold lines (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) vertical to the cutting lines (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). These two disks overlap in the direction that the central cutting lines vertical to each other to form the whole embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The four sectors formed by the four fold lines (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) and the sidelines of these two disks are the attach surface as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the specification drawing of the stickers pasted on the invention. This pattern of the stickers is basically the appearance of the invention. Except for the attach surface, each surface of these round plates are pasted with the patterned stickers (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) that link each block together. The patterned stickers (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) may form several incomplete parts of a pattern or a complete one by folding in accordance with the cutting line (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). Besides, the round plates can be opened and turned as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Move to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> Follow the cutting line (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) to open the upper disk (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and turn the upper disk (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) underneath the subjacent one (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) by taking the fold line (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) on the subjacent disk (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) as the axises, then the sticker may form a special pattern. The patterned sticker (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) inside the subjacent disk (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and upper disk (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may also be disclosed by doing that. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, from the central cutting line (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) of the subjacent disk (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), turn the subjacent disk (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) underneath the upper one (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) by taking the fold lines (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>)(<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) as the axises, then the stickers may form another patterns. Turn the disk by following the fold line, and the original pattern is represented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, it is seen that this invention can be used as a coaster. The simple look of it offers the interesting brainstorming game and reaches the purpose of promotion. This invention makes the best use of a coaster and complements the beauty of the glass on it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it is also seen that this invention combines the beauty and the creativity, and can be used as a stationery to weigh down the paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, this invention is full of fun and creativity that meets the purposes of visual effect and promotion, and also complements the beauty of the glass on it. This invention has met the requirement of patent, and we therefore apply for the patent in accordance with the law. Your careful audition and approval of this application of patent will be much appreciated. </paragraph>

<claim id="CLM-00001">
<claim-text><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A turning coaster is consisted by two disks folding together. Each disk is divided into 6 blocks by the central cutting lines and the fold lines vertical to the central cutting lines. These two disks overlap in the direction that the central cutting lines vertical to each other to form the whole embodiment. The four sectors formed by the four fold lines and the sidelines of the disks are place where the two disks attach to each other. Except for the attached surface, other surfaces are pasted by patterned stickers to link these two disks.
