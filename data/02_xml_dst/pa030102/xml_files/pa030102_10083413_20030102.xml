<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to oral care compositions in the form of a topical self-adhesive sticker that adheres to the oral tissue surface for treating mucosal disorders such as lesions, aphthous stomatitis, inflamation, microbial infection and toothache. The sticker is comprising at least a minimally effective amount of bioactive herb extract or essential oil. The herbal extract or essential oil is incorporated in the sticker as a powder prepared by evaporating plant extracts onto an inert carrier such as sugars, talc, silicone dioxide, titanium dioxide and other pharmaceutically acceptable inert powders. The bioactive powder is mixed with the adhesive carrier powder and compressed into tablet stickers. Of particular interest, this invention further relates to a method for treating oral mucosal lesions in humans by applying a topical adhesive sticker releasing a safe and effective amount of monoterpenes with three unsaturations to the oral cavity. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Gingivitis, mucosal lesions, and periodontal disease, are all undesirable conditions that affect many people. It is generally believed that the primary cause is viral infection or immune response which leads to bacterial infection of anaerobic bacteria, especially gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, in the mouth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Periodontal disease is an undesirable condition which has widespread occurrence. Periodontal disease is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. Periodontal disease affects the periodontum, which is the investing and supporting tissues surrounding a tooth (i.e., the periodontal ligament, the gingiva, and the alveolar bone). Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory disorders of the gingiva and the deeper periodontal tissues, respectively. Gingivitis occurs from the dental plaque, and periodontitis is caused by the infection spreading to the periodontal pocket or space between the gingiva and the tooth root. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Microorganisms contribute to both the initiation and progression of gingivitis, plaque, and periodontal disease. Thus, in order to prevent or treat these conditions, these microorganisms must be suppressed by some means other than simple mechanical scrubbing. The invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of the viral diseases herpes labialis (cold sores or fever blisters), herpes genitalis, herpes zoster (shingles), varicella zoster (chickenpox); inflammatory diseases and/or diseases demonstrating compromise or reaction of the immune system including aphthous stomatitis (canker sores), oral mucositis (stomatitis) secondary to chemotherapy, allergic conjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis; and lesions of injury to the skin including photodermatitis (sunburn, specifically second degree sunburn), thermal burns and pressure sores (decubitus ulcers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recurrent herpes simplex stomatitis may occur on the lips or intraorally. Outbreaks may be associated with trauma, fatigue, menstrual cycle, emotional upset, or exposure to sunlight. Vesicles, or intraepithelial blisters, usually are preceded by burning, swelling and soreness in the area where lesions subsequently develop. Vesicles are small, 1 millimeter in diameter or less and may coalesce to form larger lesions. These vesicles rupture quickly leaving small ulcerations. The most common sites of recurrent intraoral lesions are the hard palate and attached gingiva. Lesions gradually heal within 7-10 days producing no scarring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Herpes simplex 1 and/or herpes simplex 2 lesions can occur orally or genitally. Herpetic lesions usually develop within 4-7 days after contact and may vary in nature from non-specific itching and soreness to erythema on the skin or mucous membranes to the development of painful vesicles which erode and form superficial, circular ulcers with a red areola. The ulcers become crusted in a few days and usually heal in about 10 days, with scarring. Recurrent genital herpetic disease may be quite frequent and may be prolonged over many years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Herpes zoster (shingles) lesions are characterized by vesicular eruption and neuralgic pain in the cutaneous areas supplied by peripheral sensory nerves in the dorsal root ganglia affected by the virus. Herpes zoster is usually activated by local lesions involving the nerve containing the latent virus, systemic disease, particularly Hodgkin&apos;s disease, or by suppression or compromise of the immune system. Following a prodromal period of 34 days including symptoms of chills, fever, malaise and G.I. disturbances, characteristic crops of vesicles on an erythematous base appear in cutaneous areas innervated by the affected root ganglia. The involved area of the skin is usually hyperesthetic and the associated pain may be severe. Lesions usually begin to dry and scab within 10-14 days, but the outbreak of new clusters of vesicles can prolong the disease episode for weeks. Post herpetic neuralgia associated with herpes zoster may persist for months or years. Herpes zoster is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox with chickenpox being the acute, invasive phase of the virus and zoster (shingles) being the reactivation of the latent phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The usual incubation period for chickenpox following exposure to the virus is 10-14 days and the lesions erupt in successive crops for up to 6 days. Lesions progress from macule to papule to vesicle and usually begin crusting within 6-8 hours. Itching associated with the lesions may be severe and it is important to prevent scratching which may lead to widespread infection and disfigurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Aphthous stomatitis lesions (canker sores) are characterized by the development of painful, recurring necrotizing ulcerations of the oral mucosa either as solitary or multiple lesions. Etiology is unclear; however, considerable evidence suggests the disease may be an immunologic hypersensitivity response to an L-form streptococcus bacterium. Precipitating factors in canker sore lesions may include trauma (dental procedures), self-inflicted bites (as in eating), endocrine changes (premenstrual periods, following childbirth, menopause), acute psychological problems (period of increased stress), and allergic responses (asthma, eating certain foods or taking certain medications). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The aphthous ulcer can begin as a single or a multiple superficial erosion of the oral mucosal epithelium covered by a gray membrane. The most common sites of occurrence are the mucosa of the lips and cheeks, soft palate, tongue, pharynx, and all locations of unattached (to bone) gingiva and mucosa. The ulcers persist for 7-10 days and heal gradually producing no scarring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Oral mucositis (stomatitis), a common side effect of chemotherapy, may develop when chemotherapeutic agents used to treat various neoplastic diseases interfere with the maturation and replication of the cells that comprise the oral epithelium. The condition may be focal or generalized and involve the buccal mucosa, palate, tongue, floor of the mouth and the gingiva. Oral mucositis is painful and as a result patients neglect oral hygiene and fail to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. The compromised epithelial barrier can also facilitate invasion of potentially lethal bacteria and fungi that may lead to local infections and/or septicemia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Photodermatitis or sunburn results from overexposure of the skin to ultraviolet rays of 280-320 nm. Symptoms appear in 1-24 hours and peak in 72 hours. Changes in the epithelium of the skin range from mild erythema (first degree burn) to pain, swelling, skin tenderness and blisters (second degree burn). Fever, chills, weakness, dehydration and shock can occur if the sunburn is sufficiently severe and/or occupies a large portion of the body surface area. Upon eruption of any blisters formed or exfoliation, the skin may be hypervulnerable to infection and sunlight for up to several weeks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Tissue injury caused by thermal burns results in protein denaturation, burn wound edema and loss of intravascular fluid volume due to increased vascular permeability. The depth of the burn may be described as first, second or third degree. Pain or sensitivity to the touch is usually associated with first and second degree burns and blister formation is a common presentation of second degree burns. The severity of the burn is judged by quantity of tissue (body surface area) involved. Pain, increased susceptibility to infection, and scarring are the most common complications associated with thermal burns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A pressure sore (decubitus ulcer) results when tissues overlying a bony prominence have been subjected to prolonged pressure resulting in ischemic necrosis and ulceration. Decubitus ulcers can affect not only superficial tissues, but can also involve muscle and bone and the recognized stages of decubitus ulcer formation (Stage 1 through Stage 6) correspond to the tissue layers involved and the degree of involvement. The decubitus ulcer lesion, when open at any stage, poses a risk of infection and, dependent upon the depth of the lesion and the proper elimination of the pressure, can lead to tissue necrosis, epidermal desquamation, osteitis and septicemia. Surgical intervention may be required for deep lesions or lesions in which healing by current therapies is unsuccessful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Allergic conjunctivitis may occur as part of a larger allergic syndrome, such as hayfever, or may occur alone as a result of direct contact with airborne substances such as pollen, fungus spores, various dusts, or animal danders. Itching and excessive lacrimation are prominent symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis as is edema and hyperemia of the conjunctiva. Release of endogenous histamine from mast cells seems largely responsible for the results of the allergic response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Giant papillary conjunctivitis is a specific conjunctival inflammatory reaction to the materials used in the fabrication of soft contact lenses. Although the condition is similar to allergic conjunctivitis, it is characterized by papillary hypertrophy and probably represents a chronic conjunctival inflammatory reaction to denatured proteins that become adherent to the anterior lens surface. Conjunctival changes progress and include itching, lens instability, mucoid discharge and contact lens intolerance. Again, the release of endogenous histamine from mast cells seems largely responsible for the results of the allergic response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> There are a number of over-the-counter medications for cold sores (fever blisters), canker sores, oral ulcerations and the like, including Blistex, Zilacatin, and Campho Phenique. A prescription medication also is available, under the trademark Zovirax. However, for many persons suffering from cold sores, fever blisters, etc., none of these medications is very effective. Zovirax is effective when taken orally by interfering with the replication of the herpes virus at the genetic level. We are concerned that there is potential for adverse reactions any time a patient takes medication systemically that interferes with DNA replication because of the risk of the medication interfering with normal cell DNA replication within the body, as is known to occur as a result of chemotherapy agents which are targeted to interfere with genetic replication of cancer cells and sometimes produce long term adverse side effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> There are no effective over-the-counter remedies or medications for the treatment of oral lesions related to herpes zoster (shingles), varicella zoster (chickenpox), photodermatitis (sunburn), thermal burns, pressure sores (decubitus ulcers), allergic conjunctivitis or giant papillary conjunctivitis that alter the progression or severity of any of these disease states. Analgesics, humectants, topical anesthetics, and antihistamines might provide temporary symptomatic relief in any or all of the above disease states, but will generally not change the course or severity of the disease or its lesions. Prescription medications are available for some of these disease indications. However, the only one which has proven any effectiveness in treatment is, again, oral (systemic) Zovirax which is used to treat herpes zoster and varicella zoster. Topical silver sulfadiazine 1% cream, also available by prescription, has been used to treat herpes zoster and pressure sores, but without de double-blind clinical trials showing effectiveness to support this therapy. Prescription topical debriding agents are available for the removal of the necrotic tissue associated with pressure sores; however, once the necrotic tissue has been removed, these agents must be discontinued as they will retard healing of the ulcer. Topical solutions are available, mostly by prescription, which contain vasoconstricting agents or steroids and act only to temporarily relieve the symptoms associated with conjunctivitis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Conventional oral hygiene formulations are not effective in treating oral lesions as their main limitation is the contact time with the lesion surface and that the lesion is exposed to the oral environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Conventional oral formulations include toothpaste (including gels and gels for subgingival application), mouth rinses, mouth sprays, chewing gums, and lozenges (including breath mints). The choice of a carrier to be used is basically determined by the way the composition is to be introduced into the oral cavity. If a toothpaste (including tooth gels, etc.) is to be used, then a &ldquo;toothpaste carrier&rdquo; is chosen as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,988,433, to Benedict, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference (e.g., abrasive materials, sudsing agents, binders, humectants, flavoring and sweetening agents, etc.). If a mouth rinse is to be used, then a &ldquo;mouth rinse carrier&rdquo; is chosen, as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,988,433 to Benedict (e.g., water, flavoring and sweetening agents, etc.). Similarly, if a mouth spray is to be used, then a &ldquo;mouth spray carrier&rdquo; is chosen or if a lozenge is to be used, then a &ldquo;lozenge carrier&rdquo; is chosen (e.g., a candy base), candy bases being disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,083,955, to Grabenstetter et al., which is incorporated herein by reference; if a chewing gum is to be used, then a &ldquo;chewing gum carrier&rdquo; is chosen, as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,083,955, to Grabenstetter et al., which is incorporated herein by reference (e.g., gum base, flavoring and sweetening agents). The main limitation of these toothpaste, mouthwash, mouth rinse, gels, gums and lozenges formulations is the short contact time, typically for a few seconds, which is not enough for treating the lesion. In contrast to the present invention which focuses on the topical delivery of herbal agents to the infected site by placing a bioadhesive sticker loaded with herbal active agents onto the lesion or infected oral tissue which releases the active agents for at least 30 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Systemic delivery of drugs and peptides using the buccal rout of administration has been described in the literature. This route has been investigated clinically for the delivery of a substantial number of drugs. It is the traditional route for administration of nitroglycerin and is also used for buprenorphine and nifedipine. D. Harris &amp; J. Robinson, 81 J. Pharmaceutical Sci. 1 (1992). The buccal mucosa is less permeable than the sublingual mucosa. The rapid absorption and high bioavailabilities seen with sublingual administration of drugs is not generally provided to the same extent by the buccal mucosa. D. Harris &amp; J. Robinson, 81 J. Pharmaceutical Sci. 1, 2 (1992). The permeability of the oral mucosae is probably related to the physical characteristics of the tissues. The sublingual mucosa is thinner than the buccal mucosa, thus permeability is greater for the sublingual tissue. The palatal mucosa is intermediate in thickness, but is keratinized and thus less permeable, whereas the sublingual and buccal tissues are not keratinized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The use of buccal delivery systems for systemic delivery of drugs have been reviewed by Shojaei (buccal mucosa as a rought for systemic drug delivery, a review, J. Pharm. Pharmaceut Sci. 1 (1), 15-30, 1998. A non-degradable device for the delivery of buprenorphine has been described (Guo, J. H., Drug Deliv. Ind. Pharmacy, 20, 2809-2821, 1994). The buccal delivery of lidocaine and prostaglandines has been reported by Nagai (J. Controll. Rel. 6, 353-360, 1987). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> While buccal delivery systems have been suggested in prior art, the use of herbal and homeopatic medications for the treatment of oral mucosal lesions were not suggested. Dueto the safety risk of systemic uptake of drugs delivered by buccal delivery, the use of natural and safe herbal medication provide an attractive alternative for treating oral ulcers with high complience. The herbs mentioned in this invention are surprisingly effective in trating the various oral mucosal disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> There is an unmet need for an effective remedy for the viral diseases herpes labialis (cold sores or fever blisters), herpes genitalis, herpes zoster (shingles), varicella zoster (chickenpox); inflammatory diseases or diseases demonstrating compromise or reaction of the immune system such as aphthous stomatitis (canker sores), oral mucositis (stomatitis) secondary to chemotherapy, allergic conjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis; and lesions of injury, thermal burns and pressure sores. </paragraph>

A particularly preferred carrier is a bioadhesive for application to the mucosa composed of a mixtures of slightly crosslinked polyacrylic acid, i.e. Carbopol 940, 934, 974, and the like, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;adhesive&rdquo; as used herein means a substance, inorganic or organic, natural or synthetic, that is capable of surface attachment to the intended oral cavity application site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;bioadhesive&rdquo; as used herein means an adhesive which attaches and preferably strongly attaches to mucosal tissue upon hydration. Indeed, to qualify as a bioadhesive, a substance must be capable of maintaining adhesion in moist or wet in-vivo environments. The final composition of the present invention is &ldquo;self-adhesive&rdquo; in that it attaches to the site of interest without the need to reinforce its attachment by way of another adhesive which is applied to a backing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The strength of adherence can be measured by standard tests for measuring the force, e.g. in dynes per square centimeter, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,697. Suitable bioadhesives include those prepared from optionally partially esterified polyacrylic acid polymers, including but not limited to, polyacrylic acid polymers lightly crosslinked with a polyalkenyl polyether such as those commercially available from B.F. Goodrich, Cincinnati, Ohio, under the trademarks Carbopol 934, 934P, 974, 940 and 941. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Other suitable bioadhesives include natural or synthetic polysaccharides. Suitable polysaccharides include cellulose derivatives such as, cellulose acetate, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose and the like.

<heading lvl="1">Preparation of a Herbal Agent for Use in the Sticker Formulation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Because of the limited size of the device to be applied and the loading, the active agent should be concentrated to include as much active agent as possible. In addition, because the device is prepared by molding of a powder mixture in a tableting machine, it is essential that the composition will be in a free flowing powder form suitable in use with commercial tableting devices. Thus the active herbal agents should be condensed into a concentrated powder. Usually, hydroalcoholic herb extracts when dried from the solvents, form a sticky mass that can not be incorporated homogeneously as flowing powder with the inert ingredients. Also, if essential oils are used as active agents they should be converted into powder. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a method in which the active agents are absorbed into an inert free flowing powder at a high concentration which is then mixed with the bioadhesive ingredients to form a free flowing powder prior to press molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Typically, a water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable component such as a sugar is added to the herb extract solution, which after freeze-drying forms a powder. The amount of loading is given in terms of the amount equivalent to the dry weight in grams of the extracted plant per gram of inert absorbent material (sugar). For example, 2 g mannitol is dissolved into a given tincture of 100 ml prepared from the extraction of 10 g of plant and lyophilized to dryness to form a powder which weigh 2.5 grams. Each gram of this powder is equivalent to 4 gtrams of plant extract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When essential oil to be incorporated in the sticker, the oil is absorbed in a suitable powdery absorbent. Typical absorbents include for example, kaoline, Kapectin, alumina, silica, polystyrene beads, polyacrylate beads, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, and other orally acceptable powders with oil absorption capacity. The use of a crude herbal material that is part of the bioactive agents in a powder form is used for oil absorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The typical process of preparing of Crude Herbal Material for Extraction is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> 1. Crude dry herbal materials are milled into fine powders using a proper milling device. Any grinding operation that achieves the respective particle size for extraction is acceptable. Technical reason for milling step is to have a consistently-sized crude herb powder. Crude herb extractibility is a critical function of exposed surface area of crude herb powder to hydroalcoho mass ratio. To eliminate crude herb particle size as a process variable and since the various herbs have different water-holding capability (porosity/absorptivity), a singular particle size is preferred for process control. Depending on the specific type of crude herbs, milling produces a mix of coarse and fine dust particulates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 2. All milled crude herb powders are mixed in a blender to provide uniform particle size of crude herbs prior to extraction. Particle size of milled crude herbal powder is consistent following this step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> 3. Crude Herbal Material Extractions in hydroalcoholic solution (Either option is suitable) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> a.) Soxhlet option: About 1-60 parts of milled crude herbal powder are added to 100-5000 parts (process and/or deionized or equivalent grade) water:alcohol in a Soxhlet Extractor and then decanted. A Soxhlet extractor is one or more station continuous reflux extractor with internal condenser slowly feeding 4.degree.-100.degree. C. solution across the herb for up to 48 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> b.) Ultrasonics option: Suitable alternate extraction process for developing this water soluble extract include use of ultrasonic water extraction systems which can provide equivalent quality, depending on the herb, with up to 94% faster process cycles, hydrolysis extracting reactors, fixed bed extracting reactors, desorption extraction columns, and countercurrent extractors. Due to most commercial extraction process limitations, it is normal to have a small amount of particulates in this extract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> 4. Water-extracted herbal liquid is filtered (e.g., 5-100.mu.filter cartridge, fine screen or cheesecloth) or centrifuged to remove coarse and/or insoluble particulates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> 5. Filtered water-extracted herbal liquid is concentrated, depending on herbal ingredient, up to a 50% soluble solids level. In addition to concentration by evaporation, alternate suitable process to achieve higher concentrations prior to final drying include freeze concentration, partial freeze drying, membrane separation, vacuum distillation and vacuum drying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> 6. Concentrated herbal extract liquids are dried via commercial drying processes. Suitable dryers that are used include fluidized bed, vacuum plate, spray, drum-type and flash dryers. Drying efficiency is controlled for water content (&lt;10%) and free water considerations (.Itoreq.0.80) to achieve shelf-stability. Yield of soluble powder from the drying process is used as key to optimize herb: water mass formula for extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> 7. Dried pure solid herbal extract powders are sized and packaged for shipment. A dessicating-materials such as a silica gel or other suitable FDA-approved, drying agent can be used to control relative humidity and to improve shelf-life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> 8. Dried pure solid herbal extract powder is now ready for reconstitution into oral care products. </paragraph>

Sugar powder (mannitol or dextrose) is added (1 gram of sugar per 10 gram equivalent of dry plant), and freeze dry the solution to obtain a fine flowing powder. The amounts of the obtained herb medicine extracts in ethanol on the basis of dry solid substance is: 6.2, 9.4, 7.7, 7.7, 9.2 and 9.5 gram, respectively. Other plant extract powders were prepared similarly by adding to the extract solution an inert component such as sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, titanium dioxide, silicone dioxide, talk, and other inert powders. All calculations for the active agent were based on the dry plant. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The simplest method for preparing the tablets is by compression tablets using a press machine, single or multi punch. The powder of the final formulation is loaded in the punch of different diameters ranging from 4 to 15 mm and thickness of about 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm. The thickness is defined by the amount of powder added, usually 50 mg to about 250 mg. Another way of preparing thin stickers is by casting a concentrated suspension in ethanol of all tablet ingredients onto a flat surface which after solvent evaporation, a thin sheet is obtained. The sheet is then cut into the desired size and shape using a cutting mold. The concentrated suspension can be molded into a mold of the desired shape that after solvent evaporation the device is obtained. These methods were used in this study, however, the easiest and cost effective method is compression molding of powder. To block one side of the tablet for the purpose of obtaining one side adhesion and release, an inert hydrophobic non-adhesive coating was applied. For compression tablets, a double compression was used where the inert powder was first added to the punch to cover the surface. The formulation powder is added on top and compression is applied to produce a tablet with one side less water permeable and non-sticking. Typical hydrophobic powders suitable for this coating include: fatty acids and salts such as Mg- or Ca-stearate, triglycerides and fatty acid esters, ethyl cellulose, methyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymers (Eudragit), and other pharmaceutically acceptable hydrophobic components. To improve the adherence between the coating and the tablet, the hydrophobic components are mixed with the carrier components, i.e. HPMC and Carbopol at a ratio of 30 to 70% by weight. Alternatively, single layer tablets were prepared and the coating on one side was applied by spray coating of the tablet on one side with an alcoholic solution or fine dispersion of the hydrophobic coating. The spray coating of one side can be applied on the automated machine where the tablets are placed onto a running sheet which is exposed to spray nozels to spray coat the tablets. If solvent cast method of preparation is used, the coating can be applied as a spray on top of the sheet loaded with the active agents. Other industrial methods can be applied including forming the sheet on an edible hydrophobic sheet such as rise paper and cut to devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In a typical experiment, 15 mg of white powder composed on 50% Mg-stearate, 33% Carbopol 934, and 17% HPMC, is added to laboratory punch and slightly rotated to obtain a uniform surface, on top of this, 70 mg of a mixture composed of 7 mg of plant extract and 63 mg of a powder mixture of Carbopol 934, HPMC (2:1 weight ratio). The powder was compressed into a tablet at a pressure of 7 tons per sq. cm for 30 seconds. Uniform strong dark tablet with a white coating on one side were obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A multi layer sticker was prepared by compression of three different powders, the first layer is a thin layer of self adhesive powder, Carbopol 934: HPMC 2:1 w/w ratio loade with benzocaine local anesthetic for initial pain relief, the second layer is loaded with the herbal active agents and the third layer is a capping layer of a hydrophobic less water soluble layer. The main advantage of using a multilayer tablet is that each layer may contain different active agents that are exposed at a different time and rate to the mucosal surface for better treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Components that have been tested for inert self-bioadhesive polymer include: mixture of carboxymethyl cellulose, polyacrylic acid, and crosslinked arabinogalactan and dextran and polyethylene glycol that form a complex with the carboxylic acid residues of acrylates.. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Stickers loaded with Carnallite and citron oil and benzocaine as active agent, tablets AD-3-A in table of Example 1) were used for treating 17 patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) by applying a sticker twice a day onto the lesion. These patienats suffer from aphtous ulcers a few times during a month with one to three lesions each time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The results were outstanding, for all patients, the sore and pain was eliminated within three houtrs and the elimination of the lesion within 24 hours. When the patients used the stickers for several weeks, in eleven patients the lesions did not resume for at least two month. The other six patients benefited from the device that the time period between lesion formation was increased to 6 weeks with a much milder episodes. It should be noted that all patients responded extremely well to the device with high compliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Similar tablets loaded with amphotericine B as antifungal agent was prepared in a similar way and applied on patients suffering from oral fungal infection with large lesions. In all cases an improvement was recognized two days after twice a day applications. Other natural and synthetic antifungal agents are used instead of amphotericine B such as Clotremazole, and Intraconazole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In an another study, a 6-month trial was carried out, utilizing stickers loaded with the following composition: the three following components and combinations thereof: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Limonene, 92% of a citron peel essential oil, Carnallite salt, and Plant extracts of Salvia (<highlight><italic>fruticosa</italic></highlight>) and Junjerus. Limonene was prepared from citron leaves and the citron outer peel boiled in water (100&deg; C.) for up to one minute, crushed in blender and filtered. The essential oil was separated and analyzed by Gas chromatograpy to determine its composition: The following components were found, limonene&mdash;92%, myrcene&mdash;2.4%, Sabinene&mdash;0.4%, and other terpenoids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The Limonene oil (1 part), Carnallite (5 parts) and plant extract (1 part) were mixed with talk powder at a 1:1 w/w ratio to form a powder and 20 mg of the powder was mixed with the inert ingredients, Carbopol 940 and HPMC to form tablets by compression. Tablets without Limonene oil or without Carnallite were prepared and tested on patients with mucosal inflammation and gingivitis. All tablets were very active with the most active is the tablets containing the Limonene and Carnallite. The tablet without active agents had significantly lower activity. Other Citrus essential oils containing 51%, 68%, 76%, and 93% limonene were also used in combination with carnallite salt in a tablet. The activity was correlated to the Limonene content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Although the effectiveness of said solution is practically instantaneous, the long-term therapeutic effect on the gums is apparent after two weeks, while the periodontal screening index (PSI), continues to increase (indicating an improvement) throughout the duration of applying the above composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The first observable phenomenon upon initiating treatment with the above formulation is the disappearance of bleeding from the gums. In addition, during a probing procedure (the measurement of pocket depth), the bleeding effects are significantly lower.

<heading lvl="1">Homeopathic Delivery Sticker </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Homeopathy is a therapeutic approach based on the concept that disease conditions should be cured by administering drugs which, in healthy people, induce a symptom picture similar to that manifested by the disease one intends to treat. Also typical of homeopathic treatment is that extremely low, and sometimes insimal doses of the homeopathic remedy must be given in order to induce the desired therapeutic effect, whereas high doses of the same drug would actually cause the symptom picture of the disease one is seeking to cure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Homeopathic preparations are traditionally prepared by means of a method (called &ldquo;potentization&rdquo;) consisting in a succession of dilutions and succussions of the drug solution; part of the drug (of a vegetable, animal, mineral or synthetic nature) is dissolved (or ground according to the substance) in nine parts of distilled water or alcohol and the resulting mixture is shaken vigorously. Nine parts of this initial solution are taken and diluted with nine parts of water or alcohol and the resulting second diluted solution is again subjected to vigorous succussion. This stage of dilution and succussion can subsequently be repeated several times. Standard potentization levels include the 3&times; (three times), 6&times;, 200&times;, 1000&times; dilutions, etc. A homeopathic preparation therefore presents itself generally in the form of an extremely dilute solution (aqueous, alcoholic or hydro-alcoholic) of active ingredient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> This type of pharmaceutical formulation severely conditions the mode of administration of homeopathic preparations, limiting it to the oral administration of a number of drops of solution, repeated at one-hourly intervals or, at least, several times a day. Furthermore, to achieve maximum efficacy, the drops of solution must be placed under the tongue and held there for a certain amount of time before being swallowed. For example (see &ldquo;Applied Homeopathy&rdquo; by R. Jacobs and M. E. Pinkerson. Homeopathy Press, Santa Monica, Calif., 1983), 10-15 drops of a homeopathic drug for the treatment of neuralgia and sciatica (consisting of Belladonna 6&times;, Spigelia 6&times;, Mag.phos. 6&times;, and Cimifuga 6&times;) are administered until symptoms are reduced and thereafter the same dose is given 4 times daily until symptoms disappear, holding the solution each time under the tongue for 30 seconds before swallowing it. It will be noted that, though it is advisable to spread the drops of the homeopathic preparation under the patient&apos;s tongue, this is still a form of oral and not a form of percutaneous administration, as occurs with sublingual tablets, inasmuch as the solution is actually swallowed after a short space of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Sublingual tablets are also used for the administration of homeopathic drugs and present the same drawbacks as already described for solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> It is clear that these administration methods, and in particular the need for frequent administrations and for holding the drops of the preparation or the sublingual tablets under the tongue make compliance difficult for any type of patient and particularly difficult for disabled persons, elderly patients and children. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> One object of the invention is to provide a new homeopathic carrier for treating local diseases in the oral cavity which when carrying an active ingredient in a homeopathic medicine significantly increases the efficacy of the homeopathic medicine in the desired site. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for preparing such a homeopathic carrier that is in a solid form that provides the exact dose of homeopatic medication for an extended time period in an easy to apply device to the diseased site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> A homeopathic medicine for use in the treatment of bacterial infections is prepared from the following ingredients: 77 drops of a 3&times; potency solution of a blend of bacterial detoxifying homeopathics, and 1 gallon of the homeopathic carrier solution which contains 1:9 alcohol:water </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Seventy-seven drops of the 3&times; potency solution is added to a one gallon bottle. The one gallon bottle was then half filled with the homeopathic carrier solution of example 1 and the bottle is succussed by striking the bottle fifteen times on a leather-bound book. The bottle is then filled with the remainder of the homeopathic carrier solution and the bottle is again succussed by striking the bottle fifteen times on a leather-bound book. The homeopathic medicine is then ready for use. These solutions are incorporated in the bioadhesive solid powder prior to compression mold by adding the proper amount of the daily dose of the homeopathic active drops (3 to 25 drops) to the powder (80 mg of bioadhesive natural gum, i.e. karaya gum) and lyophilization. The dry powder is then compressed into a tablet which is placed onto a oral mucosal lesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Active agents that may be included in the formulation are: <highlight><italic>Aesculus hippocastanum </italic></highlight>extract, Arnica Montana extract, Belladonna, <highlight><italic>Echinacea angustifolia </italic></highlight>extract, <highlight><italic>Rhus toxicodendron </italic></highlight>extract, <highlight><italic>Ruta graveoleus </italic></highlight>extract, and Graphites at a typical concentration of 6 mcg/g and <highlight><italic>Crotalus horridus </italic></highlight>extract, <highlight><italic>Heloderma horridum </italic></highlight>extract, Lachesis extract, Naja extract and Mate extract at a typical concentration of 0.08 mcg/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the homeopathic erodible sticker are: it avoids the need for multiple, repeat administrations in the course of the day at short intervals one from another; mono-administration and, above all, not having to hold the preparation (whether in solution or sublingual tablet form) under the tongue enormously facilitates patient compliance, particularly in the case of disabled persons, elderly patients and children; administration of the drug can be interrupted at any time it may be so desired; the administration is more effective owing to the slow release of the drug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrative embodiments and that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
