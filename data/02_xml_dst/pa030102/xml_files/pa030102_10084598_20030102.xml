<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method and to an associated composition for providing a non-invasive skin rejuvenating heat treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is well known to use paraffin wax to provide heat treatment to certain parts of the body such as hands, feet and elbows. The heat treatment is intended to sooth and condition hands, feet and elbows. The skin is moisturized, thereby reducing dryness of cracks in the treated areas. The treatment also has the effect of relaxing tense muscles, thus easing pain caused by chronic joint inflammation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Several companies have marketed paraffin bath appliances for home use. These appliances are electrically heated containers provided with built-in electrical resistance heating elements. During home use of such an appliance, paraffin wax blocks are placed into the respective container, which is covered with a lid, and the appliance is plugged into a wall socket. The wax melts, in most cases after a period of several hours, and is heated to a temperature of approximately 130&deg; F. Where a hand is to be treated to moist heat, the hand with the fingers spread is dipped into the melted wax. The hand is gently removed and, after a few seconds during which the wax partially solidifies, the hand is reinserted into the wax melt. This dipping process continues several times. After a short period, the wax is peeled from the hand. The wax may be reused or discarded. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for performing a skin rejuvenating heat treatment process of the above-described type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide such a method which may be completed in a shorter period of time than the conventional methods. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An additional object of the present invention is to provide such a method wherein the apparatus is safer than in the conventional processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a paraffin wax composition which may be used in such a method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the drawings and descriptions herein. It is contemplated that every object is attained by one or more embodiments of the invention. However, not every embodiment need meet every object. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A method for providing a skin rejuvenating heat treatment comprises, in accordance with the present invention, placing a substantially predetermined amount wax composition into a microwaveable container, and exposing the container and the wax composition to microwave energy for a period sufficient to heat the wax composition to a predetermined temperature at which the wax composition is liquid. At least a portion of the heated wax composition is subsequently deposited on a human skin surface. After cooling of the deposited wax composition, the cooled deposited wax composition is removed from the skin surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Paraffin wax compositions used in the above-described conventional methods for skin rejuvenating heat treatment will not melt if subjected to microwave energy. Thus, it is a surprising and unexpected result to provide a microwave-implemented wax melting process. This result is attained by formulating the wax composition to include wax (preferably but not necessarily paraffin wax), water, and surface active componentry in an amount effective to prevent separation of the water and the wax. More particularly, the microwave-meltable composition used in the method of the present invention includes wax in an amount of 45% to 85% by weight, water in an amount of 1% to 25% by weight, and surface active componentry in an amount of 1% to 54% by weight of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Pursuant to another feature of the present invention, the surface active componentry includes one or more emulsifying agents. Any emulsifier or group of emulsifiers compatible with paraffin wax and water may be used. Suitable emulsifiers generally include emulsifying waxes (fatty alcohols, fatty acids) and specifically include such emulsifying agents as glyceryl monostearate, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and propylene glycol. Preferably, but not necessarily, all four of these emulsifying agents are included in a microwavable paraffin wax composition used in a skin rejuvenating heat treatment process in accordance with the invention. Glyceryl monostearate is preferably present in an amount of 2% to 25% by weight of the composition. Cetyl alcohol is preferably present in an amount of 1% to 8% by weight. Stearyl alcohol is preferably included in an amount of 1% to 8% by weight, while propylene glycol is preferably included in an amount of 0.5% to 15% by weight of the composition. The emulsifying componentry together has a weight percentage of 1% to 54% of the paraffin wax composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In addition to the emulsifying agents, the surface active componentry may include a surfactant. Preferably, the surfactant is present in an amount of 0.3% to 10% by weight of the paraffin wax composition and is taken from the group consisting of hydrogenated castor oil, alkyl ether sulfates, and alkyl sulfates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates a performance of the method in the home. Accordingly, the exposing of the paraffin wax composition to microwave energy includes placing the container with the wax composition into a domestic microwave oven and operating the oven at a predetermined power level. The microwaving of the wax composition may be terminated after a preset period or may be terminated upon a change in appearance of a temperature indicator element mounted to an external surface of the container so as to be visible through a window of an oven door. The temperature indicator is selected to undergo a change in appearance (e.g., color) upon reaching a predetermined temperature. That temperature is in a range between 110&deg; F. and 150&deg; F., preferably between 120&deg; F. and 140&deg; F., and more preferably between 125&deg; F. and 135&deg; F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As in conventional methods, the heated wax composition is preferably deposited on the skin surface by dipping the skin surface into the liquid wax composition in the container. However, it is possible to use an applicator, such as a brush or a roller to transfer the liquid wax from the container to the skin surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The melted wax composition deposited on the skin surface is preferably removed in a conventional manner by peeling the wax layers from the skin surface. However, other methods such as scraping are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the wax composition has a pH between about 5.5 and about 8.0.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A method for providing a skin rejuvenating heat treatment utilizes a container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) made of a microwavable polymeric material such as polyethylene. Container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a lower body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a lid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provided with a handle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with a temperature indicator element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which changes color upon attainment of a predetermined temperature by container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the contents thereof. Indicator element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made of a thermochromic material such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,319. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Lid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is removed from body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Blocks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of a paraffin wax composition are placed in the open body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Then lid <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is replaced to close the container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is then placed in a countertop or domestic microwave oven <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Microwave energy or radiation <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> generated by oven <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at a preselected power level converts paraffin wax blocks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into a wax melt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The subjecting of the paraffin wax composition in container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the microwave energy <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> generated by oven <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be terminated after a preset period programmed by the user into the oven via a keypad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. If temperature indicator element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has undergone a color change by the end of that preset period, container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed from oven <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by using a pair of handles <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) secured to lower body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If the temperature indicator element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has not yet changed color, keypad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be operated to set another, generally shorter, time period for the irradiation of container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with microwave energy <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In any case, the subjecting of container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the paraffin wax composition of blocks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to microwave energy <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is terminated no later than a change in the appearance of temperature indicator element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is mounted to an external surface (not designated) of container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to be visible through a window <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of an oven door <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Temperature indicator element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is made of a material which undergoes a change in color upon reaching a predetermined temperature. That temperature is in a range between 110&deg; F. and 150&deg; F., preferably between 120&deg; F. and 140&deg; F., and more preferably between 125&deg; F. and 135&deg; F. The paraffin wax composition is selected to exist in a liquefied or flowable form within this temperature range. Paraffin waxes having a melting point from 105&deg; F. to 200&deg; F. and more particularly from about 125&deg; F. to about 185&deg; F. are well known in the trade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> After container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the paraffin wax composition of blocks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has been exposed to microwave energy <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for a period sufficient to melt the blocks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of paraffin wax composition, container <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is removed from oven <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. At least a portion of the melted paraffin wax composition is subsequently deposited on a human skin surface. For instance, a user&apos;s hand <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) preferably with fingers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in a spread configuration is dipped into the wax melt in container body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and then gently removed so that a layer of wax forms on the hand. After a few seconds during which the wax partially solidifies, the hand <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is reinserted into the wax melt in container lower body portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This dipping process continues several times. After a short period, the wax is peeled from hand <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The wax may be reused but should be discarded eventually because of contaminant accumulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The paraffin wax composition of blocks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes paraffin wax, water, and surface active componentry in an amount effective to prevent separation of the water and the paraffin wax. More particularly, the microwave-meltable composition of blocks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes paraffin wax in an amount of 45% to 85% by weight, water in an amount of 1% to 25% by weight, and surface active componentry in an amount of 1% to 54% by weight of the composition. The water is preferably deionized water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The surface active componentry includes one or more emulsifiers compatible with paraffin wax and water, such as emulsifying waxes (fatty alcohols, fatty acids). More specifically, the paraffin wax composition includes emulsifying agents as glyceryl monostearate, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and propylene glycol. Preferred paraffin wax compositions utilizable in a skin rejuvenation heat treatment described above contain all four of these emulsifying agents. Glyceryl monostearate is preferably present in an amount of 2% to 25% by weight of the composition. Cetyl alcohol is preferably present in an amount of 1% to 8% by weight. Stearyl alcohol is preferably included in an amount of 1% to 8% by weight, while propylene glycol is preferably included in an amount of 0.5% to 15% by weight of the composition. The emulsifying componentry together has a weight percentage of 1% to 54% of the paraffin wax composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition to the emulsifying agents, the surface active componentry may include a surfactant. Preferably, the surfactant is present in an amount of 0.3% to 10% by weight of the paraffin wax composition and is taken from the group consisting of hydrogenated castor oil, alkyl ether sulfates, and alkyl sulfates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the paraffin wax composition has a pH between about 5.5 and about 8.0. The pH may be controlled by well-known agents such as sodium bicarbonate and alpha hydroxy acids. Generally, an acidic pH is more effective for exfoliation of the skin, whereas a higher pH is better for hair removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The paraffin wax compositions of the present methodology preferably include skin moisturizers and skin treatment agents such as cocoa butter, avocado oil, methyl paraben and/or propyl paraben. Any other agents suitable for improving the appearance, tone, and resilience of the skin may be incorporated into the wax composition, including, for instance, extracts of almond, aloe vera, apricot, chamomile, peach, rose hips, kola nut, oat bran, orange blossom, cucumber, echinacea, eucalyptus, ginger, ginseng, gotu kola, grapefruit, and haselnut. Additionally or alternatively, suitable extracts of other herbs, fruits, roots, nuts, sea weed, marine extracts, flowers, etc., may be provided in the wax composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The paraffin wax compositions of the present methodology also preferably include vitamins such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and vitamin E (tocopherol acetate) which are healthful skin treatment agents. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The paraffin wax composition of Example 3 is more viscous than the composition of Example 1. This composition results in a thicker layer of wax deposited on a user&apos;s hand as a result of a single insertion of the hand into the reservoir of melted wax. In a typical process using the thicker composition of Example 3, the user inserts the hand or other body part into the wax melt fewer times than with the composition of Example 1. With the composition of Example 3, the time of the overall process is reduced. The heat transferred through the skin of the user from the deposited wax is greater at the beginning of the process than in cases where the initial layer is thin, for example, if the composition of Example 2 is used. The heat transfer later in the process using the composition of Example 3 is much moderated, relative to where the compositions of Example 1 and especially Example 2 are used, owing to the greater insulation effect of the thicker initial layer of wax. The composition of Example 3 is thus preferable where the main or only purpose of the process is cleanse and rejuvenate the skin.
