<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an improved filter device for filtering, entrapping air, and preventing foaming in fluids, such as biological matter, including whole blood or blood components. More specifically, the invention relates to a filter assembly having an injection molded filter housing and a method of making a filter housing for performing the same. The invention may be used in blood collection and processing systems for removing leukocytes from whole blood, red blood cells, plasma, and platelets prior to transfusion or long term storage. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is common in the formation of medical and laboratory filters, such as blood filters or blood filtration housings containing filters, to form filter housings for filter media from one or more sheets of flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material. It is also common to manufacture filter housings from rigid plastics such as acrylic, polypropylene, or a similar material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many types of devices are commercially available for separating whole blood components. Some machines are fully automated while others rely on manual operations performed by technicians. On a gross level, blood components include plasma (water and protein), red blood cells, leukocytes, and platelets. Filter media is commercially available to filter leukocytes from blood. A filter pad media for filtering leukocytes from blood cells is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,337, commonly owned by the assignee hereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> While filter housings manufactured from flexible PVC material offer the benefit of having a flexible housing, it has been heretofore difficult to provide an efficient and reliable method for forming an inlet port and an outlet port in the filter housing. Prior art filter housings made from one or more sheets of PVC material have taught the formation of the port along the peripheral seal of the respective PVC material sheet edges. Typically, a short piece of tubing is used as the port. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,035,304 to Watanabe issued Jul. 12, 1977 and entitled Blood Filtering Bag. However, it is difficult to form a complete and reliable seal at the junction of the PVC material sheets and the tubing that serves as the port. Both an incomplete seal, as well as a weak seal can lead to fluid leaking from the filter assembly during the filtering process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Introducing fluid into a filter housing at the seal of its panels or sheets is also less desirable when the flow characteristics of the fluid across the filter media are important (e.g. laminar flow or even flow across the filter media). If the fluid enters the housing immediately adjacent the filter media, the bubble strength of the filter media may be quickly surpassed by increased blockage of the filter media with filtered particulate and the resulting increased pressure within the filter housing may cause the filter media to rupture or burst. This is a very undesirable result in that it is difficult, if not impossible to immediately detect a ruptured filter membrane. Alternatively, increased blockage of the filter media may lead to turbulent fluid flow through the filter assembly. Many fluids react poorly to turbulent flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A similar prior art filter is taught in published European Patent Publication No. 0 516 846 to Sakamoto published Dec. 9, 1992 and entitled Bag-Like Filter. This application teaches the formation of filter housings from heat-fusible polyethylene films. In one embodiment the inlet and outlet ports are formed from polyethylene tubing fused between the film and the filter at their edges. Alternatively, separate inlet and outlet ports having a construction similar to a valve placed in a tire tube may be fused through an opening formed in the central regions of the film sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other prior art devices, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,904, commonly owned by the assignee hereof, teach the formation of the inlet and outlet ports in the wall of a thermoplastic sheet filter housing by first forming a slit in the filter housing wall, inserting a separate tube through the slit and heating the mating materials to fuse the tube and sheet. While providing a very reliable filter assembly, extra care must be taken during the manufacturing process to ensure that the slit is not too large, the tube is properly placed prior to heating, and a good seal is formed around the tubing-wall junction. Some prior art filter assemblies do not include positive stops for the conduits attached to their filter ports. Without a stop, the possibility exists that the rubber or plastic conduit may be inserted too far into the port, thereby possibly damaging or piercing the filter media. In addition, if solvent is used to bond the conduit to the port, the solvent may contact and thereby degrade the filter media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Filter housings molded from hard plastics such as acrylic allow for the formation of the inlet and outlet ports at almost any location along the wall or panel of the filter housing. The location is primarily limited only by the sophistication of the mold or die. However, the resulting filter assemblies have the drawback that they are not flexible and thus cannot substantially prevent a phenomenon common in fluid filtering processes known as &ldquo;foaming.&rdquo; It is also sometimes necessary to centrifuge a blood container having a filter device attached thereto. A hard plastic filter housing may puncture or damage the blood container during the centrifuge process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Most of the whole blood collected from donors today is not itself stored and used for transfusion. Instead, the whole blood is separated into its clinically proven components (typically red blood cells, platelets, and plasma), which are themselves individually stored and used to treat a multiplicity of specific conditions and diseased states. For example, the red blood cell component is used to treat anemia; the concentrated platelet component is used to control thrombocytopenic bleeding; and the platelet-poor plasma component is used as a volume expander or as a source of Clotting Factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Automated centrifugal blood collection systems and manual systems composed of multiple, interconnected plastic bags have met widespread use and acceptance in the collection, processing and storage of these blood components. In the United States, these systems are subject to regulation by the government. For example, the plastic materials from which the bags and tubing are made must be approved by the government. In addition, the maximum storage periods for the blood components collected in these systems are prescribed by regulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the United States, whole blood components collected in a non-sterile, or &ldquo;open&rdquo;, system (e.g. one that is open to communication with the atmosphere) must, under governmental regulations, be transfused within twenty-four hours. However, when whole blood components are collected in a sterile, or &ldquo;closed&rdquo;, system (e.g., one that is closed to communication with the atmosphere), the red blood cells can be stored up to forty-two days (depending upon the type of anticoagulant and storage medium used); the platelet concentrate can be stored up to five days (depending upon the type of storage container); and the platelet-poor plasma may be frozen and stored for even longer periods. Conventional systems of multiple, interconnected plastic bags have met with widespread acceptance, because these systems can reliably provide the desired sterile, &ldquo;closed&rdquo; environment for blood collection and processing, thereby assuring the maximum available storage periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In collecting whole blood components for transfusion, it is desirable to minimize the presence of impurities or other materials that may cause undesired side effects in the recipient. For example, because of possible febrile reactions, it is generally considered desirable to transfuse red blood cells substantially free of the white blood cell components, particularly for recipients who undergo frequent transfusions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> One way to remove leukocytes is by washing the red blood cells with saline. This technique is time consuming and inefficient, as it can reduce the number of red blood cells available for transfusion. The washing process also exposes the red blood cells to communication with the atmosphere, and thereby constitutes a &ldquo;non-sterile&rdquo; entry into the storage system. Once a non-sterile entry is made in a previously closed system, the system is considered &ldquo;opened&rdquo;, and transfusion must occur within twenty-four hours, regardless of the manner in which the blood was collected and processed in the first place. In the United States, an entry into a blood collection system that presents the probability of non-sterility that exceeds one in a million is generally considered to constitute a &ldquo;non-sterile&rdquo; entry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another way to remove leukocytes is by filtration. Systems and methods for accomplishing this within the context of conventional multiple blood bag configurations are described in Wisdom U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,596,657 and 4,767,541, as well as in Carmen et al U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,810,378 and 4,855,063. In these arrangements, an inline leukocyte filtration device is used. The filtration can thereby be accomplished in a closed system. However, the filtration processes associated with these arrangements require the extra step of wetting the filtration device before use with a red blood cell additive solution or the like. This added step complicates the filtration process and increases the processing time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Other systems and methods for removing leukocytes in the context of closed, multiple blood bag configurations are described in Stewart U.S. Pat. No. 4,997,577. In these filtration systems and methods, a transfer assembly dedicated solely to the removal of leukocytes is used. The transfer assembly is attached to a primary blood collection container. The transfer assembly has a transfer container and a first fluid path leading to the transfer container that includes an inline device for separating leukocytes from red blood cells. The transfer assembly also has a second fluid path that bypasses the separation device. Using these systems and methods, leukocytes are removed as the red blood cells are conveyed to the transfer container through the first fluid path. The red blood cells, now substantially free of leukocytes, are then conveyed from the transfer container back to the primary collection container for storage through the second fluid path, this time bypassing the separation device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A need still exists for an improved biological matter filter housing that is flexible and that includes an inlet or an outlet port integrally formed in the housing. A need exists for an improved filter housing capable of trapping air and preventing foaming of the fluid or blood passed through the filter. A need also exists for a form of a fluid filter having an inlet and an outlet formed tangentially in a flexible wall of the filter assembly. A need exits for an improved flexible filter housing having integral ports including positive stops for conduits connected to the filter also exists. Because these types of devices are often used only once (e.g. disposable) a need exists for an efficient, reliable and low cost method of making the filter assembly. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is a principle object of the present invention to provide an improved filter device having a body defined by at least one injection molded, flexible filter housing element sealed to form an interior chamber. A filter medium is located within the chamber. The housing element has at least one port integrally molded therein. The integrally formed ports are tangential or substantially tangential to the filter housing walls and parallel to the filter medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a filter device is provided and defined by at least one injection molded housing element having a flexible portion formed therein and sealed along edges thereof to form an interior cavity. A filter membrane is sealed within the cavity. At least one port, in fluid communication with the interior cavity, is integrally molded in the flexible portion. In a specific application, the port is positioned tangentially with respect to the flexible portion and the filter device is positioned horizontally with respect to the port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment the filter device comprises first and second generally flexible injection molded filter housing elements, each element having a flange formed about a periphery thereof and a domed portion formed therein. At least one port is molded in the domed portion. The filter housing elements arranged along their respective flanges to form an interior cavity and a filter membrane, having an outer periphery, is positioned between the filter housing elements. The first filter housing element flange, the filter membrane outer periphery and said second filter housing element flange are sealed together to form an interior cavity. Each port is in fluid communication with the interior cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the invention includes a container comprising an injection molded sheet having a substantially flexible portion integrally molded therein. The sheet is sealed along an edge after injection molding forming an interior chamber and at least one port is integrally formed in the flexible portion of the sheet. The port is in fluid communication with the interior chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In yet further embodiments, a blood processing system is disclosed including a first bags, a second bag, and tubing providing communication between the two bags and including a blood filter or device of a type described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For example, the invention may be utilized in a multiple container blood collection system for conveniently processing the various components of blood. In such a system, the filter device of the present invention performs the function of separating the undesired matter, e.g., leukocytes, during processing. The system is arranged so that some blood components can be conveyed through the filter device, while other components can be readily conveyed along other paths that bypass the filter device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An important aspect of the invention is that the filter housing element or elements are flexible thus allowing the filter device to expand and contract during the filtration process. In a preferred embodiment, the filter housing elements are dome-like in structure and the inlet or outlet port is molded in a central region of the dome. Due to its flexible structure, the filter device is capable of minimizing foaming of the fluid passed therethrough. The volume of the interior chamber is capable of increasing and decreasing its volume during the filtration process. While the filter medium is initially spaced a predetermined distance from the housing element, this distance may also change during the filtration process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Another important aspect of the invention is that the filter device is capable of trapping air while in a horizontal orientation. In this orientation, the inlet port is positioned on the upper surface of the device and the outlet port is positioned on the lower surface. Accordingly, the present invention is well suited for applications on horizontal planes (e.g. the top panel of an instrument). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Yet another important aspect of the invention is that each filter element is injection molded thus producing a unitary, single filter element including a flexible portion and an integrally molded fluid port. The fluid ports include a port opening extending from the exterior of the element, through its flexible portion and into the element interior. The filter device inlet and outlet ports may include structure for limiting the insertion of a conduit therein. In a preferred embodiment, the filter elements may be molded from a thermoplastic material, such as polyvinyl chloride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The filter media or medium enclosed within the filter device may be any of a great number of known filtration materials. As one example, the filter medium may comprise a polyester mesh material. In a specific application of the filter device, the filtration material is may be selected to remove undesirable materials, such as leukocytes, from whole blood, red blood cells, platelet rich plasma, platelet poor plasma or platelet concentrate. Examples of these filtration materials can be found in the following patents: U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,337, U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,146, U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,541, U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,268, U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,564, U.S. Pat. No. 4,330,410, U.S. Pat. No. 4,701,267, U.S. Pat. No. 4,246,107, U.S. Pat. No. 4,936,998 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,985,153. Each of these patents is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a related aspect, the possibility of damaging or piercing the filter medium is eliminated by the inclusion of structure within the port opening that forms a stop. This aspect is particularly important when it is desirable to connect a conduit to the filter assembly using only an interference fit between the conduit and the port opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The first and second filter housings may be identical to one another. In this manner, the orientation of the filter ports can be readily positioned during the manufacturing process in the same direction or in opposed directions, depending upon the fluid to be passed through the filter, the filter medium and/or the location and application constraints of the filter device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an important specific application of the invention, the filter device may be incorporated into an apparatus for collecting and separating the various components of whole blood, e.g. red blood cells, platelets and blood plasma. The apparatus may be an automated blood separation apparatus or manual apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, an injection molding die is provided to mold from a thermoplastic material filter housing elements, each having a flange portion, a flexible central region and an integral port. A second pair of opposed dies is provided to seal filter media between first and second filter housing elements. The dies, which are formed of an electrically conductive material are positioned so that the first housing element, filter media, and a second housing element are placed between said dies. When RF energy is transmitted to the flange portions of the first and second filter housings through the conductive dies, the thermoplastic material is caused to soften or melt and to flow to seal the periphery of the filter media between the housing elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a preferred method of forming the fluid filter device from a thermoplastic material, the method comprises the steps of injection molding first and second flexible filter housings, each housing having a port integrally formed therein and having a periphery thereabout; placing a filter membrane between said first and second filter housing peripheries; and sealing along the periphery of the filter housing to form a fluid tight enclosure. In addition, the resulting enclosure may be trimmed in a cutting die to produce a more aesthetically pleasing filter device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The fusing or sealing step may be conducted by placing the metallic dies on opposite sides of the filter housings and applying energy to the peripheries to dielectrically heat said peripheries to cause softening and sealing thereof. Alternatively, the fusing or sealing step may be conducted by the application of radio frequency energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Multiple filter housing elements may be molded and multiple filter housing assemblies may be formed at the same time. Utilizing this method a third cutting die is provided to individually cut each completed filter assembly from a carrier web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Further advantages and aspects of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Although the disclosure hereof is detailed and exact to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the physical embodiments herein disclosed merely exemplify the invention which may be embodied in other specific structure. While the preferred embodiment has been described, the details may be changed without departing from the invention, which is defined by the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring more particularly to the drawings there is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7 a</cross-reference> filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used, for purposes of illustration only, to filter blood or blood components, e.g., red blood cells or platelet poor plasma in a manual or automated blood processing system during processing or before being returned to a donor from a blood separation apparatus. Two or more conduits, such as conduits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> supply unfiltered blood to and convey filtered blood from the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> respectively. Filter media, not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, is contained within filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Blood filtration is only one application of the invention and is not intended to be a limitation of the present invention. Numerous other applications of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</cross-reference>, the preferred embodiment of filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be seen to include first and second filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As will hereinafter be appreciated, and as is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are identical. Each housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed about its periphery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A domed region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed within the flange area <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are arranged, as will be described in greater detail, so that their domed regions <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> form and define an interior filter cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The domed region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of each filter housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has at least one port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed integral with the filter housing element. Port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes an inlet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that passes though domed region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and that is in fluid communication with the interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Inlet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is sized to receive the end of a fluid carrying conduit, such as a flexible medical grade plastic (e.g., PVC) or rubber tube or hose. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> shoulder <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed within each inlet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to act as a conduit stop. The conduit stop prevents the insertion of conduit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> too far into the filter assembly thereby possibly damaging or rupturing the filter media contained therein. A support rib <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed beneath each port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to reinforce the port. Support rib <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> also strengthens the fluid communication openings between the port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and filter element dome <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to prevent tearing of the port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the dome region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As will be discussed in greater detail below, each filter housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably injection molded from a flexible thermoplastic material, such as flexible PVC material. The components of each element, including the flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, domed region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, conduit stop <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and support rib <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are integrally molded as a single, unitary component. Unlike prior art devices, there is a minimized risk of fluid leaking at the junction of domed portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Various types of filter media can be contained within the interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. For example, a porous screen filter material, or a fibrous depth filter material, in single layers or in a multiple layer stack, can be used. An example of a filter media that may be sealed within the interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. As shown, a membrane of filter media <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> having a periphery <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is arranged and sealed between filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The preferred filter media <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is a soft polyester membrane having a 250 micron mesh. However, it is to be understood that any filter media, including other types of filter media membranes, could be used in the present invention. The preferred media is suitable for filtering particulate from red blood cells and platelet poor plasma before it is returned to a blood donor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, filter membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is heat sealed between the respective flanges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and housing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to form the interior region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The interior region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be further divided into a first cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> defined by housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a first side <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of filter membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a second cavity <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> defined by housing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second side <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of filter membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Again referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> fluid conduit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, such as flexible medical grade plastic (e.g., PVC) or rubber tubing, can be attached to ports <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by conventional means such as an interference fit or with the aid of a solvent. In a preferred application, fluid flows through opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed in first or upper filter housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The fluid then flows into first interior cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, through filter media <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and into second interior cavity <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The fluid exits the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by flowing through the opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed in port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of filter housing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The preferred embodiment of the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> depicts the location of the filter ports <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at the top of the domed portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The preferred embodiment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further depicts that the port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed substantially tangentially to the wall of the domed portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The type of fluid to be filtered, whether or not the filter assembly must trap air within its interior region and the physical constraints of the filter application may dictate the orientation and location of port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood that different locations and orientations of the port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be made without deviating from the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It is, thus, appreciated that the port <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed in each filter housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally tangential or parallel to the wall of the element. In the case of a filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the available surface area of the filter media <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is maximized since the filter membrane itself extends to the periphery of the filter housing interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> without adversely affecting fluid flow in and out of the filter assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> at reference numeral <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is flexible and thus capable of collapsing (as shown) and expanding depending upon the fluid or combination of fluids flowing through the filter assembly. For example, if both a liquid, such as blood, and air are simultaneously flowing through a non-flexible or rigid filter assembly, a phenomenon known as foaming is likely to occur. The present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prevents this phenomenon by its ability to collapse when the volume of a non-compressible fluid (e.g. liquid) is decreased. Decreasing the volume of the interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> prevents the foaming phenomenon from occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The present filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also functions to entrap air within its interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The design lends itself to filter applications on horizontal planes such as the top panel of an instrument. By locating the inlet and outlet ports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the central portion of each dome and provided the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned in a horizontal orientation (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), any air contained within the fluid being passed through the filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is trapped within the interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the fluid enters the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the horizontally oriented filter assembly, the air will remain in an upper portion of the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> while the fluid will pass through the filter media <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and toward the opposite or lower end of the cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Although not specifically illustrated, it is within the province of the invention to provide a single flexible filter element that is adhered to a filter media or a non-flexible filter member. A port may be integrally formed in the filter element and a supply tube may be attached thereto. While different in structure, this alternative design would allow the filter assembly to perform both the filtration function and air entrapment function discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is typically a disposable or single use item. Therefore, it is important that the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be manufactured in an efficient and reliable method. Multiple filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are preferably simultaneously formed by an injection molding process as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. The following description contemplates four filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being formed by an injection molding process and four filter assemblies <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being formed in a subsequent assembly process. It is to be understood that any number of filter housing elements and filter assemblies could be formed at the same time without deviating from the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Referring specifically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, thermoplastic material, such as flexible polyvinyl chloride, is injected between mating upper and lower die halves <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. When the die halves <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are separated, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, one or more filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the form of an integral strip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are ejected from the tooling. The strip of four filter housing elements, integrally connected by a web <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. As described supra, each filter housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a flange portion <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, domed region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In addition, a carrier web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> extends from, and in some cases connects, filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Carrier web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> may have one or more apertures <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> formed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A method of forming a filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this invention is shown in detail in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> first strip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of integrally connected filter housings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is placed over a filter membrane strip <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The number of filter housings formed on strip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be any desired number. A second strip of filter housings <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is placed below the filter membrane strip <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> as shown. Ideally, the number of filter housing in first strip should be same as the number of filter housings in second strip. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the orientation of the top filter housing element ports <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is opposite the orientation of the bottom filter housing element ports <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. While this is the preferred arrangement of the housing element strips <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, the ports <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> could have the same orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The first strip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, filter membrane <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and second strip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are brought together as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> forming a pre-assembly <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. It is important to note that the filter membrane strip is sufficiently narrow and does not cover the apertures <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> formed in the first and second strips <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. It should also be noted that the apertures <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the first strip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are in alignment with the apertures <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the second strip <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. This insures that the flange portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the respective filter housing elements are in substantial alignment as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> pair of opposed dies <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are positioned on opposite sides of filter housing element strip, filter membrane, filter housing element strip pre-assembly <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Dies <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are provided with aligned concave recesses <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> that form a pocket. While not shown, one or more mandrels may be provided on the dies for receiving the apertures in filter housing element strips <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and positively aligning the strips prior to final assembly. Dies <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are brought together for a predetermined amount of time. Preferably a stop is provided to accurately space dies <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> apart from each other. RF energy is then supplied through dies <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in order to soften the thermoplastic material of the mating filter housing elements flanges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Dies <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, which remain relatively cool, act as a mold for the softened material. Material from the flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the first outer filter housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> flows through the filter membrane strip <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Likewise, material from the flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of second outer filter housing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> flows through the filter membrane strip <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The melted periphery portions <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> serve to reinforce the junction between housings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the filter membrane strip <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. A depression <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of slightly decreased thickness is formed along the conjunctive periphery surrounding each filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. After a brief period of cooling, the softened and flowing thermoplastic material hardens sufficiently and dies <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> can be withdrawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> RF energy is applied for the dielectric heating step through a mechanism which feeds the energy equally to each die halve. Preferably, a mechanical stop is used to ensure that the two dies are separated by 0.020 inch. Since the dies are not greatly heated by the dielectric heating, they can be withdrawn after a brief cooling period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> After the assembly is thus formed by the foregoing procedure, the multiple filter assemblies are die cut as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, into individual filter assemblies. First and second cutting dies <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, commonly known in the trade, having cutting edges <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, perform the die cutting operation. A strip of assembled filter assemblies is placed between the dies <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Again while not shown, one or more mandrels may be positioned on the dies to properly align the multiple filter assembly prior to the cutting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Finally, conduits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be applied to the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by any known method, for example, interference fit, adhesive or solvent bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 through 19</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be seen to include first and second filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As will hereinafter be appreciated, and as is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>, the housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are identical. Each housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed about its periphery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A substantially flat flexible region <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed within the flange area <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are arranged, as will be described in greater detail, so that their flexible regions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> form and define an interior filter cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The flexible region <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of each filter housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has at least one port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed integral with the filter housing element. Port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes an inlet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that passes though flexible region <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and that is in fluid communication with the interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Inlet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is sized to receive the end of a fluid carrying conduit, such as a flexible medical grade plastic (e.g., PVC) or rubber tube or hose. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> shoulder <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed within each inlet <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to act as a conduit stop. The conduit stop prevents the insertion of a conduit too far into the filter assembly thereby possibly damaging or rupturing the filter media contained therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Each filter housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably injection molded from a flexible thermoplastic material, such as flexible PVC material. The components of each element, including the flange <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, flexible region <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and conduit stop <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are integrally molded as a single, unitary component. Unlike prior art devices, there is a minimized risk of fluid leaking at the junction of flexible portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> An example of a filtration medium that may be sealed within the interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. As shown, a filtration medium <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> having a periphery <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is arranged and sealed between filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The filtration medium may include polyester mesh, cotton wool, cellulose acetate or another synthetic fiber like polyester. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In a preferred alternative embodiment, filter membrane <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is heat sealed between the respective flanges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and housing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to form the interior region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The interior region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be further divided into a first half <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> defined by housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a first side <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of filter membrane <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and a second half <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> defined by housing element <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a second side <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of filter membrane <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood that the filtration medium need not be sealed within the periphery of the filter device, but may simply be located within the interior region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In use a fluid, such as whole blood, flows through opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed in first or upper filter housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The fluid then flows into first half <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, through filter media <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and into second half <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The fluid exits the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by flowing through the opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed in port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of filter housing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The depicted alternative embodiment of the filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shows the location of each filter ports <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed substantially tangentially to the wall of the flexible portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The type of fluid to be filtered, whether or not the filter assembly must trap air within its interior region and the physical constraints of the filter application may dictate the orientation and location of port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood that different locations and orientations of the port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be made without deviating from the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It is, thus, appreciated that the port <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed in each filter housing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally tangential or parallel to the wall of the element. In the case of a filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the available surface area of the filtration medium <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is maximized since the filter membrane itself extends to or near the periphery of the filter housing interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> without adversely affecting fluid flow in and out of the filter assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The filter assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this alternative embodiment is also flexible and thus capable of collapsing and expanding depending upon the fluid or combination of fluids flowing through the filter assembly. For example, if both a liquid, such as blood, and air are simultaneously flowing through a non-flexible or rigid filter assembly, a phenomenon known as foaming is likely to occur. The present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prevents this phenomenon by its ability to collapse when the volume of a non-compressible fluid (e.g. liquid) is decreased. Decreasing the volume of the interior cavity <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> prevents the foaming phenomenon from occurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the outer filter housings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> be injection molded of flexible PVC material which is selected because of its receptiveness to dielectric heat sealing. Any suitable material can be modified by addition of various plasticizers and readily sterilized using conventional sterilization methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In a preferred example of the invention, filter housing elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are injection molded from flexible polyvinyl chloride. The injection molding dies provide for a uniform wall thickness of 0.020 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also be utilized in manual blood collection assemblies for removing undesirable materials, e.g., leukocytes, from red blood cells, platelet-rich plasma, platelet-poor plasma, or platelet concentrate. A description of representative blood collection assemblies is set forth below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> One representative blood collection assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for removing undesirable materials, e.g., leukocytes, from red blood cells is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. The assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a closed manual blood collection system. In the illustrated embodiment, the assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> serves to separate and store the red blood cells as well as the plasma and platelet blood components by conventional centrifugation techniques, while removing undesired matter from the red blood cells prior to storage. In the illustrated embodiment, the undesired matter is removed generally by filtration and specifically utilizing the filter device described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a primary bag or container <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and various transfer bags or containers <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> that are attached to the primary bag <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by integrally attached branched tubing <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The tubing <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is divided by appropriate connectors into branches <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, flow control devices <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> are provide on the branched fluid flow paths as shown to enable directing of the fluid transfers in a desired sequence of steps. In the illustrated arrangement, the flow control devices take the form of conventional roller clamps that are manually operated to open and close the associated tubing paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In use, the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (which is also called a donor bag) receives whole blood from a donor through integrally attached donor tubing <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that carries an phlebotomy needle <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A suitable anticoagulant A is contained in the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The transfer bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> contains a suitable storage solution S for the red blood cells. One such solution is disclosed in Grode et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,269. Another solution is sold under the brand name ADSOL&reg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The transfer bag <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is intended to receive the platelet and plasma blood components associated with the whole blood collected in the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The transfer bag <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> ultimately serves as the storage container for the platelet concentrate constituent. The transfer bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> also ultimately serves as the storage container for the platelet-poor plasma constituent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Flow control device <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is located in tubing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to control fluid flow to and from the transfer bag <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Flow control device <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is located in tubing <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to control fluid flow to and from transfer bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Tubing <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> form a flow path to the container <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. This flow path includes the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention for separating undesired matter from blood cells. Flow control means <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is located on tubing <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> that leads to the filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The container <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> ultimately serves as a storage container for the red blood cells after passage through the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The bags and tubing associated with the processing assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be made from conventional approved medical grade plastic materials, such as polyvinyl chloride plasticized with di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP). The ends of the tubing may be connected by &ldquo;Y&rdquo; or &ldquo;T&rdquo; connectors to form the branched fluid flow paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, transfer container <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which is intended to store the platelet concentrate, can be made of polyolefin material (as disclosed in Gajewski et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,162) or a polyvinyl chloride material plasticized with tri-2-ethylhexyl trimellitate (TEHTH). These materials, when compared to DEHP-plasticized polyvinyl chloride materials, have greater gas permeability that is beneficial for platelet storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The blood collection and storage assembly <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, once sterilized, constitutes a sterile, &ldquo;closed&rdquo; system, as judged by the applicable standards in the United States. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> When the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used, whole blood is collected in the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The collected whole blood is centrifugally separaed within the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> into a red blood cell component (designated RBC in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>) and platelet-rich plasma component (designated PRP in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). During such separation techniques, a layer of leukocytes (commonly called the &ldquo;buffy coat&rdquo; and designated BC in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>) forms between the red blood cells and the platelet-rich plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In a first processing mode (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>), the platelet-rich plasma component is transferred by conventional techniques from the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to the transfer bag <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. This transfer is accomplished by opening clamp <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, while closing clamps <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. In this step, attempts are made to keep as many leukocytes in the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as possible. The transfer of platelet-rich plasma into the first transfer bag <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> leaves the red blood cells and the remaining leukocytes behind in the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In a second processing mode (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>), the solution S is transferred from the transfer bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> into the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. This transfer is accomplished by closing clamps <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, while opening clamp <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In a third processing mode (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>), the mixture of additive solution S and the red blood and leukocytes in the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is transferred into the transfer bag <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> through the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This transfer is accomplished by closing the clamps <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> while opening the clamp <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The red blood cells and additive solution S enter the container <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> essentially free of leukocytes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the filtration medium within the filter device housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be used to remove all types of undesired materials from different types blood cells, depending upon its particular construction. In the illustrated embodiment, the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is intended to remove leukocytes from the red blood cells prior to storage. For example, the filtration medium <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> located within housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can include cotton wool, cellulose acetate or another synthetic fiber like polyester. The undesired matter is removed from the red blood cells by the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In a fourth processing mode (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</cross-reference>), a constituent of the component contained in the transfer bag <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is transferred to the transfer bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, this processing mode is accomplished by first separating the transfer bags <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> from the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows). The separation of the bags is accomplished by forming snap-apart seals in the tubing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that makes up the branched fluid flow path <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> leading to the transfer bags <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. A conventional heat sealing device (for example, the Hematron&reg; dielectric sealer sold by Baxter Healthcare Corporation) can be used for this purpose. This device forms a hermetic, snap-apart seal in the tubing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (this seal is schematically shown by an &ldquo;x&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</cross-reference>). Preferably, the donor tubing <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is also sealed and disconnected in the same fashion (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Once separated, the platelet-rich plasma undergoes subsequent centrifugal separation within the transfer bag <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> into platelet concentrate (designated PC in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</cross-reference>) and platelet-poor plasma (designated PPP in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</cross-reference>). The platelet-poor plasma is transferred into the transfer bag <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (by opening the clamps <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>), leaving the platelet concentrate in the first transfer bag <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows, the bags <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are then themselves separated by forming snap-apart seals &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the tubing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for subsequent storage of the collected components. The transfer bag <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> (containing the filtered red blood cells) is also separated in the same fashion for storage (as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> also shows). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Should air become trapped in the transfer bag <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, it may be necessary to transfer the air through path <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> into the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> before separating the transfer bag <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> from the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, an air bleed channel <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can be incorporated on either side of the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for this purpose. Means such as a clamp <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> can be provided to open and close bypass line <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> as required. Clamp <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is opened during this step to allow the vented air to proceed into the primary bag <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>.

The tubing <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> is divided by appropriate connectors into branches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, flow control devices <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> are provided on the branched fluid flow paths as shown to enable directing of the fluid transfers in a desired sequence of steps. In the illustrated arrangement, the flow control devices take the form of conventional roller clamps that are manually operated to open and close the associated tubing paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In use, the primary bag <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (which is also called a donor bag) receives whole blood from a donor through integrally attached donor tubing <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> that carries an phlebotomy needle <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. A suitable anticoagulant A is contained in the primary bag <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The transfer bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> contains a suitable storage solution S for the red blood cells. One such solution is disclosed in Grode et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,269. Another solution is sold under the brand name ADSOL&reg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The transfer bag <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is intended to receive the plasma components associated with the whole blood collected in the primary bag <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The plasma component may also contain platelets and comprise platelet-rich plasma, if the media in the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has the characteristic of allowing platelets to pass. Otherwise, the plasma component comprises platelet-poor plasma. The transfer bag <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> ultimately serves as the storage container for the platelet constitent contained in the plasma constituent. In this arrangement, the transfer bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> also ultimately serves as a storage container for the plasma constituent. The transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> also ultimately serves as the storage container for the red blood cell constituent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Flow control device <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> is located in tubing <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to control fluid flow to and from the transfer bag <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. Flow control device <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> is located in tubing <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> to control fluid flow to and from transfer bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Tubing <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> forms a flow path from donor bag <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> to the container <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. This flow path includes the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention for separating undesired matter such as leukocytes from the whole blood collected in the primary bag <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Flow control means <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is located on tubing <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> that leads to the filter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The bags and tubing associated with the processing assembly <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be made from conventional approved medical grade plastic materials, such as polyvinyl chloride plasticized with di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP). The ends of the tubing may be connected by &ldquo;Y&rdquo; or &ldquo;T&rdquo; connectors to form the branched fluid flow paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, transfer container <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, which is intended to store the platelet constitent, can be made of polyolefin material (as disclosed in Gajewski et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,162) or a polyvinyl chloride material plasticized with tri-2-ethylhexyl trimel-litate (TEHTH). These materials, when compared to DEHP-plasticized polyvinyl chloride materials, have greater gas permeability that is beneficial for platelet storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the filtration medium within the filter device housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be used to remove all types of undesired materials from different types blood cells, depending upon its particular construction. In the illustrated embodiment, the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is intended to remove leukocytes from whole blood cells prior to centrifugation in the transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The media of the filter device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also remove platelets, if desired. For example, the filtration medium <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> located within housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can include polyester mesh, cotton wool, cellulose acetate or another synthetic fiber like polyester. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> After filtration, the bags <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> are separated by forming snap-apart seals &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the tubing <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. The separation of the bags is accomplished by forming snap-apart seals in the tubing <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> that makes up the branched fluid flow paths leading to the transfer bags. A conventional heat sealing device (for example, the Hematron&reg; dielectric sealer sold by Baxter Healthcare Corporation) can be used for this purpose. This device forms a hermetic, snap-apart seal in the tubing (this seal is schematically shown by an &ldquo;x&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In a first processing mode (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>), the filtered whole blood within the transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is centrifugally separated within the transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> into a red blood cell component (designated RBC in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>) and a plasma constituent, which, in the illustrated embodiment, is platelet-rich plasma component (designated PRP in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The platelet-rich plasma component is transferred by conventional techniques from the transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> to the transfer bag <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. This transfer is accomplished by opening clamp <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, while closing clamp <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>. The transfer of platelet-rich plasma into the transfer bag <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> leaves the red blood cells behind in the transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In a second processing mode (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>), the solution S is transferred from the transfer bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> into the transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. This transfer is accomplished by closing clamp <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, while opening clamp <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In a third processing mode (not shown), the red blood cells may be transferred by conventional techniques from the transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> to the transfer bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> for storage. This transfer is accomplished by opening clamp <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, while closing clamp <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>. However, in the illustrated embodiment (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>), where platelet concentrate is desired, the red blood cells and storage solution are left in the transfer bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> for storage, leaving the transfer bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> open to receive platelet-poor plasma constituent in the course of subsequent processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In this arrangement, as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> shows, the bags, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> are then themselves separated from the bag <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> by forming snap-apart seals &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the tubing <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight>. The separated bags <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> are then placed in a centrifuge to separate the platelet-rich plasma in the bag <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> into platelet concentrate and platelet-poor plasma. The platelet poor plasma is expressed from the bag <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> into the bag <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, leaving the platelet concentrate in the bag <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> for long term storage. </paragraph>
