<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains to the high speed separation of large molecules (i.e., analytes) based on size in chemical, clinical, pharmaceutical, and other applications. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Normally, separation of large molecules (including, for example, DNA) by size in chromatography or in electrophoresis requires use of another large polymer molecule. The most widely used method for separating such large molecules in an electrophoresis system is the use of a gel-sieving matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In recent years, many new gel materials have been described in the scientific literature or disclosed in patents. These materials include polymers made by chemically linking various monomers, or by linking combinations of monomers and cross-linkers, or modified natural polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Non-ionic polymeric surfactants have been used successfully as a separation medium for DNA analysis. These block copolymers have a hydrophobic core of propylene oxide blocks and a strongly hydrated shell of ethylene oxide blocks that can form micelles in solution. The aggregation number is determined by the length of the propylene oxide block. With increasing temperature desolvation of the ethylene oxide groups continues, and the effective volume fraction decreases. These globular micelles overlap and entangle each other at high concentrations. Ultimately, lyotropic liquid crystals are formed that are used as the sieving medium. The spherical micelles that result rely on partitioning based on micellar electrokinetic chromatography or adsorption of the monomers along the DNA chains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, these polymers are not always stable due to degradation with time, the testing environment and mechanical shearing during preparation. The separation performance can thus deteriorate due to such degradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition to degradation over time, the polymeric sieving mediums most commonly employed are relatively difficult to use. Accordingly, for example, filling the capillary tubes used for electrophoresis, and then cleaning such tubes after use, can be, and generally is, relatively difficult. Often, it becomes necessary to replace the capillary tubes due to contamination (stemming from retained sieving medium and/or sample solution). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also, a polymeric sieving medium cannot be altered. More particularly, the molecular weight of the polymer fixes the application. There is no ability to alter the polymer sieve medium to tailor the medium to different samples having analytes that would optimally require a polymer of a different molecular weight to serve as the sieve medium, i.e., different polymer sieve mediums often will be required for different samples due to the differing composition of the samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It would accordingly be highly desirable if it were possible to effect size separation of large molecules using a sieve medium that possessed a relatively low viscosity prior to, and after, size separation so that the sieve medium could be readily put into place, and then easily removed after use. Even further, it would be highly advantageous if a sieving medium could be provided that could be readily tailored to the requirements of a particle sample, so as to allow an efficacious and optimal size separation of the target analyte(s) in such sample. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is predicated on the discovery that certain monomeric non-ionic surfactants may be utilized to effect the size separation of large molecules (e.g., DNA samples) while avoiding the disadvantages of previously used sieving mediums. Thus, it has been found that monomeric non-ionic surfactants having a hydrophobic part or end and a hydrophilic part may be advantageously used as sieving mediums in applications ranging from chromatography to electrophoresis to capillary electrophoresis, to effectively carry out the size separation of such large molecules. A particularly useful family of such surfactants are the n-alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers, wherein the n-alkyl chain comprises the hydrophobic end, and the ethylene oxide (EO) groups comprise the hydrophilic end of the molecule. Under appropriate conditions, the hydrophobic (n-alkyl) portion such n-alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers will attract one another to form a sphere-like micelle, wherein the sphere comprises a hydrophobic core comprising the n-alkyl portions of n-alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers, and the outer portion of the sphere comprises the hydrophilic ethylene oxide (EO) groups of said ethers. With the use of an n-alkyl group that is relatively long compared to the length of the EO chain comprising the hydrophilic portion of the molecule, micelles undergo one-dimensional growth by balancing the intermolecular forces. The micellar structures change from sphere to rod-like with such one-dimensional growth. Finally, a giant wormlike micelle forms with huge aggregation numbers. These wormlike or rod-like micelles become sufficiently long and flexible and act as a dynamic polymer solution although they are not chemically linked as in traditional linear polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> More generally, the instant invention may be practiced using any monomeric non-ionic surfactant of the general formula B-A, wherein B is a hydrophobic end of the surfactant molecule and A is the hydrophilic end of the molecule. Such molecules balance intermolecular forces and form sphere-like micelles, wherein the core of the spherical micelle comprises the hydrophobic end (B) of said surfactant molecules, and the outer portion of said sphere-like micelles comprises the hydrophilic portions (A) of said surfactant molecules. Under appropriate conditions, such sphere-like micelles aggregate to form long rod-like micelles capable of behaving like a dynamic polymer solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The efficacy of utilizing such monomeric surfactants in size separation is substantial. Being soluble in water or other suitable slightly polar organic solvents, a low viscosity solution can be achieved for filling the sieving medium receptacle (e.g., capillary tubes), then heated to an elevated temperature to provide the desired micelle configuration for effecting the size separation, and then the receptacle cleaned by dilution with the solvent after use, as disassembly of the micelle occurs. Accordingly, the sieving medium utilized in this invention is a readily handleable, low viscosity solution, except when in use as the sieving medium during size separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Moreover, and importantly, the sieving media of the present invention can be readily altered as desired to tailor the medium for optimal size separation of the molecules in the specific sample involved. More specifically, the equilibrium solution of the self-assembled surfactant micelles resulting from the use of the monomeric non-ionic surfactants results in dynamic long polymer chains that can be tailored to the specific application by adjusting the surfactant concentration in the water or other solvent of use, the separation temperature and buffer additions or denaturants so as to provide the optimal sieve medium.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As stated earlier, it has been found that monomeric non-ionic surfactants having a hydrophobic end and a hydrophilic end, such as the n-alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers, may be advantageously used as sieving mediums in applications ranging from chromatography to electrophoresis to capillary electrophoresis to effectively carry out the size separation of large molecules.

In general, and as has been previously discussed, the present invention can be used for the size separation of analytes of large molecular weight for whatever purpose and may be used in any type of analysis system. Use in a capillary electrophoresis system for the separation of DNA is exemplary. However, this should not be construed so as to limit the application of this invention to use with any other analysis system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In order to understand how surfactant polymer solutions effect DNA separation, we recall the separation mechanism of DNA electrophoresis in traditional polymers. Many theoretical models have been proposed to describe DNA separation in sieving matrices, including Ogston sieving model (see Ogston, A. G. <highlight><italic>Trans. Faraday Soc. </italic></highlight>1958, 54, 1754-1757), reptation (see De Gennes, P. J. <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Phys. </italic></highlight>1971, 55, 572-579), biased reptation model (BRM) (see Slater, G. W.; Kist, T. B. L.; Ren, H.; Drouin, G. <highlight><italic>Electrophoresis </italic></highlight>1998, 19, 1525-1541), constrained release (CR) of entangled polymers (see Duke, T.; Viovy, J. L.; Sememov, A. N. <highlight><italic>Biopolymers </italic></highlight>1994,34, 239-247, Viovy, J. L.; Duke, T. <highlight><italic>Electrophoresis </italic></highlight>1993, 14, 322-329, Slater, G. W.; Mayer, P.; Hubert, S. J.; Drouin, G. <highlight><italic>Appl. Theor. Electr. </italic></highlight>1994, 4, 71-79, Slater, G. W.; Mayer, P.; Drouin, G. <highlight><italic>Electrophoresis </italic></highlight>1993, 14, 961-966), and &ldquo;reversible gel&rdquo; model (see Duke, T.; Viovy, J. L. <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. E </italic></highlight>1994, 49, 2408-2416). Here, the reversible gel model developed by Duke and Viovy is invoked. In this model, they assumed that the topological constraints on DNA motion in entangled long-chain polymer solutions are perpetually changing as intermolecular bonds break and form or as the polymers diffuse. The mobility of DNA molecules in a temporary gel &mgr; is, <highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>

The static properties of non-ionic surfactants, such as osmotic compressibility, show similar behaviors to those observed in semidilute solutions of long-chain polymers.

Phys. Chem. </italic></highlight>1992, 96, 459-467). When the surfactant concentration is above the crossover point from dilute to semidilute solution regimes, the monomers entangle each other and form a transient network of overlapping micelles (see Cates, M.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> From Eqs. 4 to 7, the static properties (effective molecular weight, radius of gyration, etc.) of the transient network of overlapping micelles are determined by surfactant concentration and physical structure (hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties), which are therefore different from those governing traditional long-chain polymers. The dynamic properties of self-assembled micelles (viscoelasticity, self-diffusion, etc.) are also distinguishable from entangled long-chain polymers (see Cates, M. E.; Candau, S. J. <highlight><italic>J. Phys. Condens. Matter </italic></highlight>1990,2, 6869-6892, Cates, M. E. <highlight><italic>J. Phys.: Condens.

The flexible worm-like micelles behave like dynamic polymers, whose chains are subject to reversible breakage and formation. The dynamic properties of such polymers in the entangled state can be described by a modified reptation model, in which the scission and recombination reactions of the chains are introduced. The lifetime of a chain with mean length ({overscore (L)}) before breaking into two pieces (&tgr;<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>) is defined as, </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The present results are different from traditional long-chain polymer solutions. In order to achieve long reads, a large {overscore (L)} and a small D<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>are preferred. {overscore (L)}, from Eq. 9, is determined by the temperature and the total volume fraction (surfactant concentration). Higher temperatures and concentrations give rise to large {overscore (L)} (see Balmbra, R. R.; Clunie, J. S.; Corkill, J. M.; Goodman, J. F. <highlight><italic>Trans. Faraday Soc. </italic></highlight>1964, 60, 979-985, Cates, M. E.; Candau, S. J. <highlight><italic>J. Phys.: Condens. Matter </italic></highlight>1990, 2, 6869-6892, Groswasser, A. B.; Wachtel, E.; Talmom, Y. <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>2000, 16, 4131-4140). However, D<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>shows a different concentration dependence. In the low concentration regime, D<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>decreases with increasing concentration (Eq. 13). Thus, long reads should be obtained by increasing the surfactant concentration. At the high concentration regime, {overscore (L)} increases with concentration as &phgr;<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight> while D<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>also increases with concentration as &phgr;<highlight><superscript>&frac23;</superscript></highlight>. Thus, N*&tilde;&phgr;<highlight><superscript>{fraction (5/12)}</superscript></highlight> according to Eq. 15 and increasing the concentration is worse for long reads. In addition, it is noted that M<highlight><subscript>w</subscript></highlight>&tilde;{overscore (L)}. At a given set of conditions, it is preferred to use surfactants with a large aggregation number (large M<highlight><subscript>w</subscript></highlight>) to achieve a large {overscore (L)}. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Suitable Monomeric Non-Ionic Surfactants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As regards suitable monomeric non-ionic surfactants, those of the n-alkyl polyoxyethylene ether family, wherein the n-alkyl chain comprises a hydrophobic end of the molecule and the ethylene oxide (EO) groups comprise a hydrophilic end of the molecule, may be used. However, the present invention may be practiced using any monomeric non-ionic surfactant of the formula B-A, wherein B represents a hydrophobic moiety and A represents a hydrophilic moiety. More particularly, the surfactants selected are preferably completely soluble in the water or a suitable slightly polar organic solvent (e.g., dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, methylethylketone) at a concentration, and under conditions, which will provide the apparent equivalent weight of the self-assembled micelle in solution required for the particular application. To achieve the relatively high aggregation numbers required, the hydrophilic moieties, A, should be susceptible to hydrogen bonding or the like so as to provide the desired worm-like micelles. Most preferably, the surfactants utilized should have relatively large aggregation numbers, which can be considered as the equivalent weight, while having a relatively low critical micellar concentration (CMC). Thus, surfactants having an aggregation number of at least 100 are preferred, even more preferably at least 1,000. The static properties (effective molecular weight, radius of gyration, and the like) of the self-assembled, transient network of the overlapping micelles that form the worm-like structure are determined by the surfactant concentration and the physical structure of the surfactant (viz., the hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Suitable specific examples of satisfactory monomeric non-ionic surfactants of this invention are the n-alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers in which the length of the carbon chain (&ldquo;C&rdquo;), the hydrophobic portion of the molecule, is 14 to 16 carbon atoms, and the EO groups comprising the hydrophilic portion of the molecule number 6 to 8. Most preferably, useful surfactants comprise C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, and C<highlight><subscript>14</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>wherein E represents the EO hydrophilic moieties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Hydrophobic backbones other than n-alkyl chains can be employed. Chains including vinyl groups or the like thus can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Separation Systems </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Separation systems for which the present invention can be used to separate analytes (i.e. molecules) are characterized by the method of separation used. In electrophoresis, for example, analytes with a net charge are separated by an electrical current, which causes analytes to migrate in a particular direction of the current. In chromatography, separation is carried out by the use of pressure caused by liquid, gas, or any other medium that pressures analytes to move toward a particular direction. Generally speaking, such separations take place in a particular separation system within a receptacle such as a tube (metal or plastic), microfabricated channels, or capillaries, that contains a particular sieving medium. The receptacles in which the present invention are used preferably have an inlet (intake end) and an outlet (outflow end), wherein the sample to be analyzed is introduced into the intake end of the receptacle and, due to migration caused by electrophoresis or chromatography, migrates toward the outflow end of the receptacle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> With respect to electrophoresis systems used in the analysis of genetic material, the medium in which separation traditionally took place was slab gel (see G. L. Trainor, Anal. Chem., 62, 418-426 (1990)). Recently, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has emerged as a powerful separations technique, with applicability toward a wide range of molecules from simple atomic ions to large DNA fragments. In particular, capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) has become an attractive alternative to slab gel electrophoresis (SGE) for biomolecule analysis, including DNA sequencing. See, for example, Y. Baba et al., Trends in Anal. Chem., 11, 280-287 (1992). This is generally because the small size of the capillary greatly reduces Joule heating associated with the applied electrical potential. Furthermore, CGE produces faster and better resolution than slab gels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> More particularly, in capillary electrophoresis, DNA usually migrates against electroosmotic flow (EOF). Coated capillaries or buffer additives are often used for reducing EOF. Non-ionic surfactants, such as Brij 35 (C<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>23</subscript></highlight>), have been employed for decreasing EOF in CE (see Towns, J. K.; Regnier, F. E. <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>1991, 63, 1126-1132, Salmanowicz, B. P. <highlight><italic>Chromatographia </italic></highlight>1995, 41, 99-106, Durkin, D.; Foley, J. P. <highlight><italic>Electrophoresis </italic></highlight>2000, 21, 1997-2009). Ellipsometry studies also confirmed that non-ionic surfactants are easily absorbed onto the polar or hydrophilic silica/water interface to form a constant thickness layer (see Tiberg, F.; Jonsson, B.; Lindman, B. <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>1994, 10, 3714-3722). In fact, because the monomers are small compared to other DNA sieving matrices typically used, the coating resulting from the present invention is expected to be more uniform and more easy to put on and to wash off. Thus, a bare capillary may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> N-alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers (C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, and C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>) have low CMC and large aggregation numbers (see Becher, P. <highlight><italic>Nonionic Surfactants: Physical Chemistry</italic></highlight>; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1967, Schick, M. J. <highlight><italic>Nonionic Surfactants: Physical Chemistry</italic></highlight>; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1986, Balmbra, R. R.; Clunie, J. S.; Corkill, J. M.; Goodman, J. F. <highlight><italic>Trans. Faraday Soc. </italic></highlight>1964, 60, 979-985, Cummins, P. G.; Staples, E. <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>1989, 5, 1195-1199, Lin, Z.; Scriven, L. E.; Davis, H. T. <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>1992, 8, 2200-2205). For instance, the CMC of C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is 1 &mgr;M (see Becher, P. <highlight><italic>Nonionic Surfactants: Physical Chemistry</italic></highlight>; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1967) and the apparent micelle length for 1% C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>at 28&deg; C. is 340 nm, which is comparable to the length of 1 kb ds-DNA. When the temperature increases to 38&deg; C., the micelle length reaches 700 nm (see Cummins, P. G.; Staples, E. <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>1989,5, 1195-1199, Lin, Z.; Scriven, L. E.; Davis, H. T. <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>1992, 8, 2200-2205). The size of the micelles can be adjusted by changing both the surfactant concentration and the temperature (see Balmbra, R. R.; Clunie, J. S.; Corkill, J. M.; Goodman, J. F. <highlight><italic>Trans. Faraday Soc. </italic></highlight>1964, 60, 979-985, Groswasser, A. B.; Wachtel, E.; Talmom, Y. <highlight><italic>Langmuir </italic></highlight>2000, 16, 4131-4140). Moreover, the micelle size is determined by the structure of the surfactants. At the same concentration and temperature, the aggregation number of C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is larger than that of C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>. Therefore, the desirable dynamic polymer size can be easily controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In general, the instant invention may be used within any separation receptacle in any separation system. In a preferred embodiment, an electrophoresis system using multiplexed capillaries for separation is used. An example of such suitable system is described in Gao, Q.; Pang, H. -M.; Yeung, E. S., <highlight><italic>Electrophoresis, </italic></highlight>20, pp.1518-1526 (1999). Other suitable capillary array electrophoresis systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,324,421, 5,498,324, 5,582,705, 5,695,626, and 5,741,411 to Yeung et al. The disclosures of the instrumentation shown, and the protocols described, in these patents are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The sieving medium can be loaded into the receptacle for the particular separation technique by any means desired, many techniques being known and useful. Thus, for example, in the case of capillary electrophoresis, the sieving media employed in the present invention can be injected using pressure, as often employed with the relatively viscous polymeric mediums previously used. This technique will be most useful when the monomeric surfactants of this invention are assembled into the desired micellar configuration prior to loading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> However, the monomeric surfactants used in this invention are relatively low viscous solutions at ambient temperatures, and at the concentration that generally will be used (i.e., ranging from perhaps as low as 0.1% up to 10% or more, depending upon the requirements of the particular application. Accordingly, and, pursuant to the present invention, the non-ionic monomeric surfactant used is first formed into a solution with the solvent and concentration desired, with a buffer or the like being added as considered appropriate. Then, the thus formed solution can be injected into the capillaries as a low viscosity solution. Increasing the temperature to the run temperature desired will then allow the more viscous and desired micellar structure to be self-assembled. Following completion of the run, and allowing the temperature to come to ambient, the low viscosity solution that returns can be easily removed, as by injecting an appropriate acid (e.g., HCl) and then rinsing with deionized water or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Further, and as may be appreciated from the Examples which follow, the present invention is not only capable of being used in a relatively facile manner, but is highly versatile. Thus, previously used polymeric gel sieving mediums were somewhat limited. Once the polymer molecular weight that was most suitable for a particular use was selected, that circumscribed the utility. The molecular weight of the polymer could not be altered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In direct contrast, and in accordance with a further aspect of this invention, the micellar configuration that is assembled cannot only be readily disassembled, but can thereafter be further reassembled, as desired. Accordingly, by utilizing the same surfactant, the characteristics of the micellar configuration can be adjusted by varying the concentration and use temperature so as to tailor the sieving machines to the parameters required for the particular sample or analyte(s) of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show one suitable capillary array electrophoresis system according to the present invention. Capillaries <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are arranged in a coplanar, parallel array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The annular wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of each capillary <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a first transparent portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The transparent portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is transparent to light having a wavelength about equal to a wavelength of a beam of coherent light used to irradiate a target species in a capillary. Each capillary is loaded with a non-ionic monomeric surfactant of the present invention at the concentration and use temperature selected to provide the appropriate micelle for the target analyte(s) in the sample(s) to be analyzed. Together, the transparent portions <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the annular walls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> define a transparent path <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> extending through the capillary array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the capillaries <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Side-entry irradiation of target species (a technique more thoroughly described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,411) in a capillary <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is effected through the transparent portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the annular wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of each capillary <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Light passes through the transparent portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of each capillary <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a sequential manner. A coherent light source <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is positioned to direct a beam <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of coherent light along the transparent path <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and B). The beam <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of coherent light in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be focused and collimated through a collimating focusing lens <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> interposed between the coherent light source <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the capillary array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The focused line of the laser may be altered with a beam expander <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in order to more effectively irradiate a large number of capillaries. The beam <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can optionally be altered or redirected, as with a mirror <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, filter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, prior to contacting the array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> show an alternative embodiment of the system &ldquo;S&rdquo; wherein the annular walls <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the capillaries <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; have a second transparent portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for optically coupling the transparent path <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to a location <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> external to the capillary array, such that electromagnetic radiation can travel between the two sites. The location <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> external to the capillary array preferably contains an optical detector <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, at least one capillary <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with a sample <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so that the sample <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is drawn into the capillary <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Each capillary has an intake end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, an outflow end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and an annular wall <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a first transparent portion <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> defining a transparent path <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> extending through the capillary array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the capillaries <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Where detection is to take place via laser-induced fluorescence, a sample containing a fluorescent target species is introduced into the intake end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of at least one capillary <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the sample migrates through the capillary <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> toward the outflow end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably, sample introduction is accomplished using pressure injection as disclosed in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,411. Fluorescence emission may be induced from the target species by irradiating it with a beam of coherent light <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> directed along the transparent path <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Where a capillary contains fluorescing target species, fluorescence detection can also be effected by any convenient alternative means, as by using optical fibers. Optical fibers can, for example, be optically coupled to the transparent path <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> axially by inserting one or more optical fiber into a capillary (Yeung et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,401, Jun. 28, 1994, incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The instant invention may also be used in a capillary electrophoresis separation system utilizing UV/absorption-based detection. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows one such embodiment. Capillaries are packed side-by-side at the detection window <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). At the outlet of the capillary array, the capillaries are bundled together to allow simultaneous buffer filling and rinsing. At the injection end (inlet), the capillary array is spread out and mounted on a copper plate to form a format with dimensions that fit into a microtiter plate for sample introduction as indicated at <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The sieving medium comprising non-ionic monomeric surfactants is introduced into the inlet of the capillaries, suitably by pressure injection as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,411. In addition, conductive pins are located next to the capillary tips to serve as individual electrodes. Sample and buffer trays are moved and aligned under the capillary inlets, so that the capillary array is never physically moved. A high voltage DC power supply <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> provides power for the electrophoresis, with all the electrodes being connected to the same power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the light source, filter, capillary array holder, camera lens, and detector are all contained in a light-tight metal box attached to an optical table. The light source may be an AC or DC light source, and may be single wavelength or multiple wavelengths. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> tungsten lamp <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or a hand-held mercury lamp <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is used for visible or UV detection, respectively. Generally, the light source, the capillary array, and the optical detector (the photodiode array detector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) are aligned in a linear manner, as generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,900,934 (Gilby et al.), and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The system comprises an optical detector capable of detecting transmission of light through a sample in a capillary. The optical detector is preferably a photodetector array that includes a plurality of photosensitive elements providing a serial output. The elements are preferably pixels of a photodiode array, wherein the detector has linear aligned pixels located in a plane parallel to the capillary array. The photodiode array detector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is optically coupled to the capillary array such that at least one of the capillaries in the capillary array is optically coupled to less than about ten of the linearly aligned pixels. An imaging lens <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may optionally be interposed between the capillary array and the image array detector used to optically couple the pixels to the capillaries. Further, an interference filter may be employed to filter light transmitted from the capillary array in order to define the absorption wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the UV/absorption-based multiplexed capillary electrophoresis system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the annular wall of each capillary in the array contains a transparent portion for use in optically coupling the interior portion of the capillary to the photodiode array detector. A sample containing any absorbing target species (e.g. DNA) is introduced into the inlet of the capillary such that it migrates through the capillary containing the sieving medium of the present invention toward the capillary outlet. Absorption by the target species is then induced by irradiating it with a beam of light from the light source. The level of absorbance is detected by the photodiode array detector through the transparent portion of the optically coupled capillary using the optically coupled pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A more complete description of an embodiment of a multiplexed capillary electrophoresis system utilizing UV/absorption based detection for which the present invention may be used may be found in U.S. Provisional Application 06/153,263 and PCT/US00/20447, and those references are hereby incorporated in there entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The following Examples further illustrate the invention but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> CE instrument with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, built in-house, has been described in previous work (see Wei, W.; Yeung, E. S. <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. A </italic></highlight>2000, 745, 221-230). Briefly, about 10-mW of 488-nm laser light from an argon-ion laser (Model Innova 90, Coherent, Palo Alto, Calif.) was used for excitation. The laser beam was focused on the detection region of the capillary by a 1-cm focal length lens at an angle of 90&deg; to the laser beam. A 530-nm long-pass filter was used to eliminate the scattered light before imaging onto the photomultiplier tube (PMT). The fluorescence signal from the PMT was transferred directly through a 10-k&OHgr; resistor to a 24-bit A/D converter (Lawson Labs, Kalispell, Mont.) and stored in a 486/33 computer at 4 Hz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Fused-silica capillaries with 50-&mgr;m I.D. and 363-&mgr;m O.D. were purchased from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix, Ariz.). The separation capillary was enclosed in a 0.5-cm I.D. copper heating jacket. The jacket is connected to a water bath circulator (Fisher Scientific). A model HH23 microprocessor thermometer was directly connected to the outside of the copper tube so that the separation temperature can be directly read with a precision of 0.1&deg; C. </paragraph>

The intercalated dyes for DNA labeling (1:5 dye:DNA), Thiazole orange (TO) and SYBR&reg; Gold nucleic acid stain, were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.). M13(-21) DNA samples were prepared at the Nucleic Acid Facility (Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa) by using cycle sequencing, BigDye-primer, Ampli Taq FS polymerase and standard Applied Biosystems reagents.

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> This Example illustrates the role of surfactant concentration on separation performance. In a first set of test runs, samples containing 1-kb and 5-kb DNA ladders as markers were separated at different C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>concentrations using the Instrumentation previously described. Sample introduction, as well as the surfactant introduction prior to the sample introduction, was accomplished by pressure injection as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,411. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the concentration dependence on the separation limit (conditions: L<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>&equals;60 cm, E&equals;250 V/cm, 1 &mgr;M TO in 100 mM HEPES-TEA buffer (pH 7.0), room temperature). In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> electropherograms labeled (a) and (b), the resolution for the 1-kb and 5-kb DNA ladders is poor at 0.1% of C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. When the concentration increases to 0.25%, both 1-kb and 5-kb ladders can be resolved well (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 </cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). According to Eq. 15, when the concentration increases in the low concentration regime, {overscore (L)} increases and D<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>decreases such that the separation limit is extended. Therefore, at these conditions, 0.25% separates the low from the high concentration regimes. However, when the surfactant concentration was increased further (up to 0.5%), for the 1-kb ladder improved resolution was not observed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. On the other hand, the resolution for large DNA is decreased, which results from the increase of D<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>with concentration. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>through <highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, the larger fragments show asymmetric peaks characteristic of mismatch between their mobilities and those of the buffer ions usually observed only in zone electrophoresis (see Mikkers, F.

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> N-alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers usually have low cloud points (T<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>). When the temperature reaches T<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, micelles could not be formed (see Becher, P. <highlight><italic>Nonionic Surfactants: Physical Chemistry</italic></highlight>; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1967). However, T<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>can be adjusted by adding urea (see Briganti, G.; Puvvada, S.; Blankschtein, D. <highlight><italic>J. Phys.

C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>was chosen as the sieving medium here due to the relatively high cloud point, so that a wide temperature range could be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A set of test runs was conducted using samples containing 10-bp DNA ladders as markers, with each test run attempting to resolve the 10-bp ladders at a different surfactant temperature (conditions: L<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>&equals;50 cm, 7% C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>with 1:10,000 diluted SYBR&reg; Gold nucleic acid stain, 100 mM HEPES-TEA buffer (pH 7.0) with 3 M urea, E&equals;200 V/cm).

At room temperature (i.e., 25&deg; C.), the resolution is poor. When the temperature rises to 54&deg; C., improved resolution is observed (data not shown). The best separation was achieved at 71&deg; C. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). When the temperature at which the separation was carried out was further increased to 74&deg; C., the resolution is lost again, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. This phenomenon can be explained by the various micellar structures at different temperatures. At low temperatures, the aggregation number (hence the micellar molecular weight) for C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>is too small to form an effective network, even when the concentration is much higher than the CMC. With increasing temperature, the micelles become larger and larger until they entangle one another. Sieving separation is thus possible. When the temperature reaches its cloud point, phase separation occurs. As a result, the surfactant solution loses its ability to separate DNA fragments because of the absence of dynamic long chains of micelles in solution. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> This Example illustrates DNA sequencing using the method of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> A sequencing run was conducted using a sample containing BigDye primer G-labeled only M13(-21) Sanger fragments were separated using the following conditions: L<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>&equals;65 cm, E&equals;150 V/cm, 10% C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>E<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>in 75 mM TAPS/75 mM histidine/50 mM Tris/2 mM EDTA (pH 8.2) with 7 M urea at 34&deg; C.; the samples were injected at a constant electric field of 150 V/cm for 30 s. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows that single-base resolution of 0.5 (the minimum required for DNA sequencing) up to 600 bp is obtained within 60 min at 34&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Further improvements in the maximum number of bases read may be possible through additional optimization of the separation conditions. This is because strain on the polymer network is rapidly dissipated by equilibration with the monomer units, a feature that is analogous to the favorable separation of large DNA fragments at higher temperatures (see Salas-Solano, O.; Carrilho, E.; Kotler, L.; Miller, A. W.; Goetzinger, W.; Sosic, Z.; Karger, B. L. <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>1998, 70, 3996-4003, Zhou, H.; Miller, A. W.; Sosic, Z.; Buchholz, B.; Barron, A. E.; Kotler, L.; Karger, B. L. <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>2000, 72, 1045-1052). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Examples 6-9 utilize the present invention in DNA sequencing in a multiplexed capillary electrophoresis system employing UV/absorption-based detection: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Inroduction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) has become an important technique in DNA sequencing because of its high speed, high resolution, flexibility, and possibility of building an integrated and automated system. Traditionally, in order to decipher the DNA sequence, radioactive or fluorescent labeling of the DNA fragments created by Sanger&apos;s chain termination reaction (see F. Sanger, S. Nicklen, A. R. Coulson, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>USA</italic></highlight>), 74 (1977) 5463) is required for applying standard detection methods. Since autoradiography is labor intensive and can pose safety concerns, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) has replaced it as the main detection method in DNA analysis. Compared to LIF, UV absorption detection is not as sensitive, but the instrumental setup is simpler and less expensive. It is easier to operate and maintain because of the use of a UV lamp rather than a laser system. No dye-label is required when using UV absorption detection in DNA analysis, since DNA has strong absorption at 254 nm. A 100-bp DNA has essentially 100 absorbers per fragment. Finally, mobility shift should not be a problem because no labels are present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Because there are no dye labels, the DNA products from the four individual termination reactions must be run with four different capillaries in order to assemble the sequence. This is analogous to radioactive labeling and infrared single-label sequencing in slab-gel sequencing. The use of four separate capillaries at a time means that a multiplexed capillary system is likely required to achieve high-speed, high-efficiency, and high-throughput DNA sequencing. A novel absorption detection method has been applied to multiplexed capillary electrophoresis (see X. Gong, E. S. Yeung, <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem., </italic></highlight>71 (1999) 4989). The system has proven to be very reliable and efficient in many applications, such as screening of enzyme activity, peptide mapping of proteins and genetic typing (see X. Gong, E. S. Yeung, <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. B, </italic></highlight>741 (2000) 15, S. H. Kang, X. Gong, E. S. Yeung, <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem., </italic></highlight>72 (2000) 3014, Menchen, S. M.; Johnson, B.; Winnik, M. A.; Xu, B. <highlight><italic>Electrophoresis </italic></highlight>1996, 6, 23-28). It is shown herein that this same instrumentation can be used in DNA sequencing, employing the novel dynamic sieving matrix of the present invention, based on the self-assembly of monomeric surfactants into large aggregates under certain conditions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> All chemicals for preparing running buffer solutions were from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). The running buffer solution contained 89 mM Tris, 50 mM TAPS, 20 mM histidine, 2 mM EDTA and 7 M urea in deionized water and was filtered with a 0.22 &mgr;m cellulose membrane filter from Corning (Corning, N.Y.). The chemicals for cycle-sequencing buffer (MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and Tris) were from Fisher (Fair Lawn, N.J.). 10-bp DNA ladder was obtained from Life Technologies (Frederick, Md.). The internal standards, 40-bp and 80-bp fragments, and selected cycle-sequencing primers, were prepared at the Nucleic Acid Facility (Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa). The 323-bp template was prepared using reagents in PCR Core System II from Promega (Madison, Wis.) and its Positive Control PCR Protocol. The PCR product was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit from Qiagen (Valencia, Calif.). ThermoSequenase (32 U/&mgr;l), dNTPs (100 mM) and ddNTPs (10 mM) were obtained from USB/Amersham Life Sciences (Arlington Heights, Ill.). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In order to generate enough quantities of sequencing fragments for UV detection, the cycle-sequencing protocol introduced by Cohen et al. was used (see Froim, C. E. Hopkins, A. Belenky, A. S. Cohen, <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res., </italic></highlight>25 (1997) 4219). The reaction mixtures were combined in a microcentrifuge tube and put on ice: 200 pmol primer, 0.2 pmol template, 10 &mgr;l Tris pH 9 (250 mM), 10 &mgr;l MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(50 mM), 10 &mgr;l dNTP mix (10 mM) and 32 U ThermoSequenase. Autoclaved and deionized water was added to obtain a total volume of 90 &mgr;l. 20 &mgr;l reaction mixture and was added to each of the four 0.2 ml PCR reaction tubes (Molecular BioProducts, San Diego, Calif.) containing 1.25 &mgr;l of the appropriate ddNTP (1 mM). The samples were kept on ice before put onto the preheated block (95&deg; C.) of GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). The total cycle number is 200. Each cycle contains three consecutive steps: 95&deg; C., 30 s; 52&deg; C., 30 s; 72&deg; C., 30 s. The product of cycle-sequencing reaction was purified by a spin column (Princeton Separation, Adelphia, N.J.), and dried in vacuum. Before injection, the DNA samples were dissolved in 3 &mgr;l deionized water and transferred to a 96-well 0.2 ml micro-tube plate (Marsh Biomedical Products, Rochester, N.Y.), spiked with 10 pmol internal standards (40-bp and 80-bp DNA fragments). After heating the plate at 95&deg; C. for 3 min for denaturing, the sample plate was put onto ice for injection. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The sieving matrix was prepared by dissolving polyoxyethylene(6) cetyl ether (Sigma) in the running buffer while gently heating and stirring. Then, the low viscosity gel was forced into a 24-capillary array from the ground end. Before injection, the matrix-filled capillary array was pre-run for 5 min at 32&deg; C. Injection was performed at 2 kV for 2.5 min. During the run, the temperature was kept at 32&deg; C. The running voltage of 8.8 kV was applied by a power supply from Glassman High Voltage, Inc. (Whitehorse Station, N.J.). After each run, the capillaries were regenerated by washing with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid for a few minutes, then rinsed with deionized water for half an hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Principles of Normalization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Even though typically in a capillary array system all the capillaries are run under exactly the same conditions (voltage, temperature, injection time and buffer pH), the surface chemistry and geometry of the capillaries are different. Also, the sieving matrix is not likely the same after being pushed or otherwise loaded into the capillaries. These variations may cause substantial variations in the migration times of DNA fragments which preclude calling bases by simply overlapping the four individual electropherograms. It has already been demonstrated that the use of two internal standards provides normalization of migration times in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) and in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) (see G. Xue, H. -M. Pang, E. S. Yeung, <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem., </italic></highlight>71 (1999) 2642). This normalization method should also be useful in unlabeled DNA sequencing. Without labeling dyes, there should be no mobility shift among the Sanger fragments. Also, since sufficient denaturant (7 M urea) has been included in the buffer, compressions in GC-rich regions are minimized. Non-uniform migration times among different capillaries are therefore only caused by the variations mentioned above. So, two DNA fragments of known lengths were used to adjust the migration times of each capillary for base calling. Another basis that makes the internal standardization method suitable for CGE is that the relationship between migration time and base number is linear over a narrow range (see A. Belenky, D. L. Smisek, A. S. Cohen, <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. A, </italic></highlight>700 (1995) 137). In entangled polymer solutions, a preferable model that describes DNA movement is &ldquo;the biased reptation with fluctuations&rdquo; (BRF) model (see T. Duke, J. L. Viovy, A. N. Sememov, <highlight><italic>Biopolymers, </italic></highlight>34 (1994) 239). According to this model, for small molecules (below a critical size), the mobility of the DNA fragment &mgr; is inversely proportional to its size, represented by base number (&ldquo;reptation without orientation&rdquo;) (see C. Heller, <highlight><italic>Electrophoresis, </italic></highlight>20 (1999) 1962): </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> where &mgr;<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is the mobility in free solution. From the definition of electrophoretic mobility: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> where v is the average velocity, E is the externally applied electric field strength and x is the distance travel in time t (see A. Belenky, D. L. Smisek, A. S. Cohen, <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. A, </italic></highlight>700 (1995) 137). Eq. (16) can thus be changed to: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Based on the migration times of the two internal standards in each capillary, linear equations of t&tilde;N for the corresponding electropherograms can be determined. Then, the migration times of the DNA fragments in every capillary can be adjusted using one capillary as the migration time standard. After the normalization process, the sequence of the DNA template can be called according to the order of the adjusted migration times. For example, there are two different equations for the electropherograms of ddATP and ddCTP termination reactions: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Using Eq. (19) as the standard equation, the terms in Eq. (20) can be manipulated to give the identical value for N<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> A sample solution containing the ladder was injected into selected capillaries containing the surfactant without dilution. The raw data is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>&mdash;extracted UV electropherograms of 10-bp dsDNA ladder separation in the capillary array system. Even though the samples were the same and all the capillaries were operated under the same conditions at the same time, the migration times of the same length fragment in different capillaries are different. Here, 4 or 5 capillaries were bundled together at the ground end to facilitate filling with gel with a 100-&mgr;l glass syringe. &num;2, &num;5, and &num;6 indicate the group of capillaries each numbered capillary belongs to (capillaries No. 8, 10 are from bundle &num;2; No. 19, 21 are from bundle &num;5; No. 23, 26 are from bundle &num;6). It can be seen that the migration times in the capillaries are very different no matter whether the capillaries are from the same bundle or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Using the three largest peaks (10 bp, 100 bp and 330 bp) as internal standards, these electropherograms can be aligned. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> shows the result of using 10-bp and 100-bp fragments as standards to align the other peaks.

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> However, for the peaks larger than 100-bp, the 330-bp peak must be used together with the 100-bp fragment as standards to achieve the proper result (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>). This confirms that the linear relationship only fits in a narrow range. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> This run used ssDNA, the Sanger fragments derived from the cycle-sequencing reaction. The four chain-termination reactions created four sets of DNA fragments, corresponding to the four bases in DNA, A, C, G, and T. In order to obtain enough signal for UV absorption detection, the dried sample was dissolved in deionized water to implement stacking in injection. A layer of silicone oil (Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.) was put on top of the vials to avoid evaporation during heating. It is known that the efficiency of CGE separation of oligonucleotides dissolved in water or other low ionic strength solvents is affected by the injection field strength and duration (see D.

It was found that a 2 kV injection voltage and a 2.5 min injection time worked best. The longer injection time did not degrade the separation performance because of stacking. This is confirmed by examining the resolution among the small DNA fragments, which would have been affected the most by electrokinetic injection. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Using the field strength and direction found in Example 7, this Example carries out DNA sequencing according to the present invention when employing a laboratory UV detection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Sequencing runs were conducted for pGEM DNA in four capillaries of the array. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the resulting four electropherograms for A, C, G, and T in four capillaries of the array. The known base number, N, was plotted as a function of migration time t (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). In an individual capillary, the base number is proportional to the migration time t. However, the correct order of bases cannot be obtained from the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> data because of migration variations among capillaries. Some fragments can be off by 5 bp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in these runs, two internal standards, 40-bp and 80-bp DNA fragments (the peaks with &ldquo;*&rdquo; on top in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), were co-injected with the DNA samples. Based on the migration times and base number of these internal standards, all the t&tilde;N equations of the capillaries were determined. After normalization of the migration times, the four electropherograms were aligned to call the sequence of the template, as shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows that, after normalization, all the peaks are on the same line, and the sequence can be read directly from the data in these two figures: </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In the worst case, there exists only a 0.5 bp error. The standard fragments added prevent base calling at those specific locations. However, staggered sizes can be used to span a large normalization range and to recover any missing information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The protocol used compensates for the amount of product by using short template, high concentration of primer, and high number of reaction cycles. So, the read length is short in this experiment. Especially for the A reaction, no peaks can be seen in the electropherogram after 89 bp. For the C, G, T reactions, even though the read length was up to 150 bp, the right sequence can only be called from 26 bp to 93 bp because of the limited useful range of two internal standards. Clearly, such short sequences may well not allow the present scheme to compete with current instrumentation for genomic sequencing. However, for diagnosis (see X. Gong, E. S. Yeung, <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. B, </italic></highlight>741 (2000) 15) or antisense characterization (see A. Belenky, D. L. Smisek, A. S. Cohen, <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. A, </italic></highlight>700 (1995) 137), read lengths of 100 bp are adequate. The present scheme therefore offers an alternative to mass spectrometric analysis of short fragments (see Z. Fei, T. Ono, L. M. Smith, <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res., </italic></highlight>26 (1998) 2827). The fact that capillary arrays are eventually scalable to 384 or even 1536 formats means that using 4 lanes at a time is not unreasonable. The unusually large number of amplification cycles implies a longer sample preparation time. However, that is preferably performed off-line in an automated system and has little effect on the throughput. </paragraph>

A separate G sample was run with the other four A, C, G, T sample run (Example 8 and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) in the same array. After migration time correction, the peaks for the same length fragments were aligned exactly. It was thus confirmed that, after migration time correction, there is no mobility shift among the capillaries. Some small ghost peaks (the peaks without matching peaks in the other electropherogram) were found which only showed up in one of the electropherograms, presumably due to the loss of fidelity of the cycle-sequencing reaction. </paragraph>
