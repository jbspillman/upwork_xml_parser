<heading lvl="1">Prior Art </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The requirement for greater integration and higher density of semiconductor devices has brought with it ever more-stringent requirements for the degree of cleanliness against fine impurities on the surface of semiconductor wafers. Therefore in order to raise the manufacturing yield for semiconductor chips, it is necessary to remove impurities effectively by cleaning the semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The cleaning of semiconductor wafers includes multiple processes for removing from the surface of the semiconductor wafer fine particles consisting of many types of impurities, such as metal impurities, organic impurities, or silicon. In the cleaning processes, semiconductor wafers are successively cleaned in multiple cleaning tanks in which various cleaning solutions circulate. Multiple semiconductor wafers are conveyed held in an arbitrary tray and are placed within a cleaning tank for a preset cleaning time. The following describes a typical cleaning process that is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (1) The semiconductor wafers are conveyed into a cleaning tank of SC-1 (an aqueous solution of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide: NH4OH, H2O2, H2O) and are cleaned for about 10 minutes, mainly for the purpose of removing fine particles on the surface of the semiconductor wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (2) Next, in order to rinse off the SC-1 from the surface of the semiconductor wafers, said semiconductor wafers are conveyed into a cleaning tank of ultra-pure water and are rinsed for about 10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (3) Next, the semiconductor wafers are conveyed into a cleaning tank of SC-2 (HCl, H2O2, H2O) and are cleaned for about 10 minutes, mainly for the purpose of removing metal impurities and organic impurities on the surface of the semiconductor wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (4) Next, in order to rinse off the SC-2 from the surface of the semiconductor wafers, said semiconductor wafers are conveyed into a cleaning tank of ultra-pure water and are rinsed for about 10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (5) Next, said semiconductor wafers are conveyed into a cleaning tank of a mixed solution of hydrogen fluoride (a cleaning solution of dilute HF, FPM (HF, H2O2, H2O), etc.) and are cleaned for about 1-5 minutes, mainly for the purpose of removing silicon oxide film (natural oxide film) on the surface of the semiconductor wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (6) As the final process, in order to rinse off the HF (hydrogen fluoride) mixed solution, said semiconductor wafers are conveyed into a cleaning tank of ultra-pure water and are rinsed for about 10 minutes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> But because a large quantity of chemicals are used in said typical cleaning process, it has been pointed out that the cost of consumables and the cost of treating the effluent is enormous, and curtailing these costs is strongly desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Against this background, research has widely been carried out into new cleaning methods employing cleaning solutions to replace these chemicals, and as one result of this research, a method has been newly proposed in which hydrogen water is used as the cleaning solution instead of the SC-1 currently used mainly for the purpose of removing fine particles on the surface of the semiconductor wafers, and ultrasonic vibration is applied to it. But although this method is able to effectively remove the fine particles (hereafter called simply &ldquo;particles&rdquo;) that adhere to the surface of the semiconductor wafers that have a silicon oxide film layer on their surface, in cleaning silicon wafers that have no silicon oxide film layer on their surface (hereafter called &ldquo;bare silicon&rdquo;), this method has the problem that its particle removal efficiency is inferior to that of the current cleaning with SC-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The graph below presents the results of experiments comparing the particle removal rate of the current cleaning with SC-1 and cleaning with hydrogen water, for wafers with a silicon oxide film and bare-silicon wafers. What were compared were hydrogen water (in-solution hydrogen concentration: 0.6 ppm) (example 1), hydrogen water to which 1 ppm of ammonia (NH4OH) is added (example 2), SC-1 heated to 40&deg; C. (example 3), and SC-2 heated to 80&deg; C. (example 4). Also, except in the case of example 4, ultrasonic vibration is applied during the cleaning. 
<image file="US20030000548A1-20030102-P00001.TIF" id="EMI-00001"></image>
</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As shown above, the result is obtained that in cleaning bare silicon, the ability to remove particles is lower than with SC-1, even if one uses hydrogen water to which ammonia has been added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Therefore the purpose of this invention is to provide a cleaning method and device that has a high ability to remove particles in cleaning both silicon oxide film wafers and bare-silicon wafers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The method of this invention for removing particles on semiconductor wafers has a first cleaning process in which semiconductor wafers are cleaned for a prescribed time by immersing them in a first cleaning solution consisting of ultra-pure water containing a prescribed quantity of ozone in a first cleaning tank, and a second cleaning process in which said semiconductor wafers are cleaned for a prescribed time by immersing them in a second cleaning solution consisting of ultra-pure water containing a prescribed quantity of hydrogen in a second cleaning tank, and ultrasonic waves are supplied to said second cleaning solution in said second process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> If cleaning with ozone water (ultra-pure water containing a prescribed quantity of ozone) is done prior to cleaning with hydrogen water (ultra-pure water containing a prescribed quantity of hydrogen), an oxide film is formed on the surface of the semiconductor wafer in said stage of cleaning with ozone water, resulting in a condition in which particles on the wafer surface adhere to the oxide film. As has long been known, the electric potential sign of the oxide film and the particles is equal, and the bonding force between them is weaker than the bonding force of the particles to the semiconductor wafer surface before an oxide film is formed. As a result, it is thought that particles can easily detach from the semiconductor wafer surface because of the subsequent cleaning process with hydrogen water. In particular, by applying ultrasonic waves in the cleaning process with hydrogen water, a large number of cavitations occur in the cleaning tank, and particles adhering to the surface of the wafers are easily detached by the force of their physical impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the method of this invention for removing particles on semiconductor wafers, it is desirable that it have, between said first cleaning process and said second cleaning process, a third cleaning process in which said semiconductor wafers are cleaned for a prescribed time by immersing them in a third cleaning solution consisting of ultra-pure water in a third cleaning tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is desirable that it have, after said second cleaning process, a fourth cleaning process in which said semiconductor wafers are cleaned for a prescribed time by immersing them in a fourth cleaning solution consisting of HF mixed solution in a fourth cleaning tank. The oxide film on the semiconductor wafers is effectively removed by this fourth cleaning process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Also, it is desirable that it have, before said fourth cleaning process, a fifth cleaning process in which said semiconductor wafers are cleaned for a prescribed time by immersing them in a fifth cleaning solution consisting of ultra-pure water in a fifth cleaning tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Also, it is desirable that the in-solution concentration of the ozone in said first cleaning solution be in the range 2 ppm to 20 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also, it is desirable that said first cleaning solution contain hydrochloric acid in an in-solution concentration in the range 1 ppm to 500 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also, it is desirable that the in-solution concentration of the hydrogen in said second cleaning solution be in the range 0.3 ppm to 0.8 ppm. Heretofore, if hydrogen water is to be used for cleaning to remove particles, it has been considered good to have the in-solution concentration of the hydrogen be as high as possible (1.0 ppm or more), but experiments by the inventors have shown that very good results are obtained at an in-solution concentration of hydrogen in the above range in the so-called batch cleaning to which this invention applies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it is desirable that the cleaning time in said first and second cleaning processes be in the range 3 to 20 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The device of this invention for removing particles on semiconductor wafers has a first cleaning tank filled with a first cleaning solution consisting of ultra-pure water containing a prescribed quantity of ozone, a second cleaning tank filled with a second cleaning solution consisting of ultra-pure water containing a prescribed quantity of hydrogen, an ultrasonic wave supply means for supplying ultrasonic waves to said second cleaning solution in said second cleaning tank, and a control means that controls the conveyance so as to immerse the semiconductor wafers in said first cleaning solution in said first cleaning tank, after a prescribed time remove said semiconductor wafers from said first cleaning solution and immerse them in said second cleaning solution in said second cleaning, and after a prescribed time remove said semiconductor wafers from said second cleaning solution. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the following, a detailed description of this invention is given, based on an embodiment illustrated in the drawings. The method of this invention for removing particles on semiconductor wafers applies in particular to the cleaning of bare-silicon wafers, and is preferably used to replace the cleaning process for removing particles by SC-1 in the aforementioned typical cleaning process for bare-silicon wafers. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a conceptual diagram of the process of this invention for the cleaning processes that removes particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Multiple silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are held upright in an arbitrary tray <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a conveyance crane not pictured here conveys them between the cleaning tanks where the cleaning processes are carried out. In carrying out the particle removal processes of this invention, cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which contains ozone water, and cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which contains hydrogen water, are provided. The silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in said tray <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are first introduced into cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> containing ozone water and undergo cleaning here for 3-20 minutes, preferably 10 minutes, then are introduced into cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> containing hydrogen water and undergo cleaning here for 3-20 minutes, preferably 10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Put into cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is ozone water, that is, ultra-pure water (UPW) to which a prescribed quantity of ozone gas has been added. In the preferred embodiment, the in-solution of the ozone gas is 2 ppm to 20 ppm. At least while silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are in the cleaning tank, ozone water is continuously supplied in cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by a supply means not pictured. Silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are introduced into said cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by a conveyance crane not pictured, and are kept here for a prescribed time. In this process of this invention for particle removal, the surface of each silicon wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is exposed to ozone water, and a silicon oxide film (SiO2) is thereby formed on its surface. The thickness of the oxide film if cleaning with ozone water is done for 10 minutes is 8-12 Angstrom units. About 1 ppm to 500 ppm of hydrochloric acid may be added to said ozone water in order to promote the metal impurities removal efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Put into cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is hydrogen water, that is, ultra-pure water (UPW) to which a prescribed quantity of hydrogen gas has been added. In the preferred embodiment, the in-solution concentration of hydrogen gas is 0.3 ppm to 0.8 ppm. This corresponds to 20% to 50% of the saturated concentration of hydrogen gas. At least while silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are in the cleaning tank, hydrogen water is continuously supplied in cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by a supply means not pictured. Cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is equipped with ultrasonic vibrators <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which supply&mdash;that is, radiate&mdash;ultrasonic waves of a prescribed frequency to the hydrogen water in cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The irradiation with ultrasonic waves may begin either before or after the silicon wafers are conveyed into cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, after going through the process of cleaning by said ozone water, are introduced into this hydrogen water cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and are kept there for a prescribed time. In this cleaning process, particles adhering to the surface of silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are effectively removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Also, between the cleaning with ozone water and the cleaning with hydrogen water, one may clean the silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with ultra-pure water and rinse away the cleaning solution that came to adhere to the silicon wafers in the ozone water cleaning. In particular, it is desirable to do this if hydrochloric acid is added to the ozone water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> outlines the composition of a hydrogen water supply device that generates hydrogen water and supplies it to cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In the drawing, hydrogen water supply device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is constructed with degassing cylinder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and gas dissolving module <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> positioned on top of water path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, which supplies ultra-pure water to cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Degassing cylinder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is used for removing the nitrogen, oxygen, and other in-solution gas that is contained in the ultra-pure water. Gas dissolving module <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, which is composed using a hollow-thread film module, etc., is for dissolving a prescribed quantity of hydrogen gas into the ultra-pure water that passes through it, so one generates hydrogen water of the prescribed concentration by introducing flow-controlled hydrogen gas into it and passing ultra-pure water through its gas atmosphere. In the embodiment of this invention, the desirable in-solution hydrogen concentration of the hydrogen water supplied to cleaning tank <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is 0.3 ppm to 0.8 ppm, that is, 20% to 50% of its saturated concentration. The device that supplies ozone water to cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be constituted by an ozone water supply device of the same composition as above (that is, it supplies ozone gas instead of hydrogen gas to the gas dissolving module). It may also be constituted with degassing cylinder <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a control block diagram for implementing the cleaning processes of this invention. In control <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, ultrasonic vibrators <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and silicon wafer conveyance crane <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are driven and controlled based on control signals from sequencer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Sequencer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is equipped with timer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, and it is activated (set) or stopped (reset) by receiving detection signals from wafer detection sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Wafer detection sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is installed on or in cleaning tanks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and detects whether silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are present inside the cleaning tank. Sequencer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> monitors the time measured by timer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and is constituted so as to output each prescribed control signal when it reaches a preset time. The prescribed control signal from sequencer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is given to transmission circuit <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, which excites ultrasonic vibrators <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and ultrasonic waves are supplied inside the cleaning tank. Also, sequencer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> emits the prescribed control signal to conveyance drive unit <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, whereby conveyance crane <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is activated and silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are conveyed out of cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Control by said control block is begun by wafer detection sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> detecting the conveyance of silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> into cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. That is, when silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are conveyed into cleaning tank <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by conveyance crane <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, wafer detection sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> detects this and emits a detection signal to sequencer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. When sequencer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> inputs this detection signal, timer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is set, and measurement of the time begins. Sequencer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> monitors the time measured by timer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and maintains a wait state, without emitting any control signal, until the preset cleaning time (for example, 10 minutes) elapses. By this process, the surface of the silicon wafers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is oxidized, and a silicon oxide film is formed on their surface.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of this invention, a third cleaning process with a HF mixed solution (a cleaning solution of dilute HF, FPM (HF, H2O2, H2O), etc.) is carried out. The third cleaning process, with a HF mixed solution, is carried out, following the above cleaning process with hydrogen water, for the purpose of removing the natural oxide film. The need for this process is high if high device electrical characteristics are required, such as source-drain formation, contact hole formation, or EPI film formation. If cleaning is done with a HF mixed solution, next the cleaning solution is rinsed away with ultra-pure water or hydrogen water (in this case, ultrasonic waves may be supplied). Also, it is desirable to rinse away the cleaning solution of all the ultra-pure water processes prior to this third cleaning process. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Also, in each cleaning process, cleaning solution was supplied into an 18.24-liter cleaning tank at a supply quantity of 15.0 liter/min, and the silicon wafers were immersed for 10 minutes in each tank. If ultrasonic waves were used, their output was set to 1.0 MHz, 4.1 W/cm2. Measurement of the residual particles was applied to those of size 0.2 &mgr;m or larger, using a laser diffusion type particle counter. The results are shown in the following graph.

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> From the above results, if cleaning is done with ozone water then cleaning is done with hydrogen water according to this invention (working examples 1-3), the removal rate for particles adhering to the surface of silicon wafers (initial number of particles&mdash;number of particles after cleaning)/initial number of particles&times;100) showed a high particle removal rate in the cleaning of both bare-silicon wafers and silicon oxide film wafers, as compared with the case in which only ozone water or only hydrogen water is used (conventional examples 1-3). And in the cases according to the working examples of this invention, even with respect to cleaning using a solution with SC-1 (conventional examples 4 and 5), it showed a particle removal rate of about the same in the cleaning of bare-silicon wafers, and greater in the cleaning of silicon oxide film wafers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">WORKING EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The inventors also conducted experiments to discover the preferable range of in-solution hydrogen concentration to be used in the hydrogen water cleaning process. According to what was known previously, the in-solution hydrogen concentration of the hydrogen water to be used for cleaning was set to the range 1.0 ppm to 1.6 ppm. But from experiments by the inventors, it was learned that in the batch-type cleaning using cleaning tanks as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, particles on the surface of wafers are removed very effectively at an in-solution hydrogen concentration of 0.3 ppm to 0.8 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the experiments, samples were made in which about 300-400 particles per 6 inches were intentionally made to adhere onto bare-silicon wafers and silicon oxide film wafers, they were cleaned using hydrogen water of varying in-solution hydrogen water concentrations, and the number of particles remaining after cleaning was measured. The in-solution hydrogen concentration of the hydrogen water was varied between 0 and 1.5 ppm. Also, in each cleaning process, hydrogen water was supplied into an 18.24-liter cleaning tank at a supply quantity of 15.0 liter/min, and silicon wafers were immersed for 10 minutes in each tank. The ultrasonic wave output was set to 1.0 MHz, 4.1 W/cm2. Measurement of the residual particles was applied to those of size 0.2 &mgr;m or larger, using a laser diffusion type particle counter. The experiments were carried out on hydrogen water into which 1 ppm (pH&equals;9.4) ammonia was mixed (Table 3) and on the hydrogen water into which none was mixed (Table 4). The results are shown in the following graph. 
<image file="US20030000548A1-20030102-P00001.TIF" id="EMI-00003"></image>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the above results, if cleaning is done using hydrogen water having an in-solution hydrogen concentration of 1.0 ppm to 1.6 ppm, which heretofore has been considered the preferable range, a very low particle removal rate is obtained, but if the hydrogen concentration is set to a range of 0.3 ppm to 0.8 ppm, that is, 20% to 50% of its saturated concentration, a very good particle removal rate is shown. Properly speaking, the ultrasonic waves that are generated in the hydrogen water are thought to function so as to remove the particles on the surface of the silicon wafers by the physical impact force due to their cavitation effect, but if the in-solution hydrogen concentration is increased to near its saturated concentration, bubbles readily occur inside the cleaning tank, and this is thought to instead reduce the ability to remove particles. That is, it is thought that because of the increase in bubbles, some of them adhere to the silicon wafer surface by surface tension and linger there, which actually adsorbs particles in the hydrogen water, and the large number of bubbles impede the energy propagation of the ultrasonic waves and reduce the (physical) impact force due to the cavitation effect on the silicon wafer surface. Therefore, by the above experiments, control of the bubbles is possible, and it is very effective for particle removal to use hydrogen water of 0.3 ppm to 0.8 ppm, which is 20% to 50% of the saturated in-solution hydrogen concentration, as the range of concentration that effectively links the cavitation effect due to the ultrasonic waves to particle removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The foregoing has been a description, with diagrams, of an embodiment of this invention. But this invention is not limited to what is shown in the above embodiment, and it is clear that it can be modified or improved based on what appears in the patent claims. As shown by the above experimental results, the particle removal method of this invention can be put to effective use not only in cleaning bare-silicon wafers but also in cleaning silicon oxide film wafers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> With this invention as described above, high particle removal is possible in cleaning using only functional water consisting of ozone water and hydrogen water, both for silicon oxide film wafers and bare-silicon wafers. In particular, even more-effective particle removal can be done in a process of cleaning with hydrogen water by setting its in-solution hydrogen concentration to 0.3 ppm to 0.8 ppm, which is 20% to 50% of its saturated in-solution hydrogen concentration. </paragraph>
