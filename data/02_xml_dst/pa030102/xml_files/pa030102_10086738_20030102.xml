<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Application of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) allows to visualize protein heteromerization and conformational changes in single living cells (Tsien, R. Y. &amp; Miyawaki, A. (1998) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>280, 1954-1955). FRET utilizes two GFP mutants having different colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Wild-type GFP (WT-GFP) has a bimodal absorption spectrum with two peak maxima, at 395 and 475 nm, corresponding to the protonated and the deprotonated states of the chromophore, respectively (Tsien, R. Y. (1998) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>67, 509-44). The ionization state is modulated by a proton network, comprising an intricate network of polar interactions between the chromophore and several surrounding amino acids. In contrast to WT-GFP, the chromophore of most GFP variants titrates with single pKa values, indicating that the internal proton equilibrium has been distrupted as a result of an external manipulation (Llopis, J., McCaffery, J. M., Miyawaki, A., Farquhar, M. G. &amp; Tsien, R Y. (1998) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>95, 6803-6808). One of the variants is the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). It has a T203Y substitution which is responsible for the red-shift emission at 528 nm. It has been predicted that the tyrosine introduced at position 203 would be involved in a &pgr;-stacking interaction with the chromophore (Orm&ouml;, M., Cubitt, A. B., Kallio, K., Gross, L. A., Tsien, R. Y. &amp; Remington, S. J. (1996) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>273, 1392-1395), which has been demonstrated by X-ray crystallography (Wachter, R. M., Elsliger, M. A., Kallio, K., Hanson, G. T. &amp; Remington S. J. (1998) <highlight><italic>Structure </italic></highlight>6, 1267-1277). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Within the rigid &ldquo;&bgr;-can&rdquo; structure (Yang, F., Moss, L. G. &amp; Phillips, G. N., Jr (1996) <highlight><italic>Nat. Biotech. </italic></highlight>14, 1246-1251) of GFP variants, Baird et al. found a site that would tolerate circular permutations where two portions of the polypeptide are flipped around the central site (Baird, G. S., Zacharias, D. A. &amp; Tsien, R. Y. (1999) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>96, 11241-11246). With obvious clefts in the &bgr;-can, the chromophore of the circularly permuted GFPs (cpGFPs) seemed to be more accessible to protons outside of the proteins. The use of cpGFP might be interesting for converting the interaction signal between two protein domains into a change in the electrostatic potential of the chromophore, in other words, to transduce the information of the interaction into a fluorescent signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, there has not been reported a cpGFP having sensitivity to a calcium ion, in particular a cpGFP which can be used as an indicator for quantifying calcium ion concentration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel fluorescent protein having sensitivity to a calcium ion, in particular a fluorescent protein which can be used as an indicator for quantifying calcium ion concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, the present inventors have carried out concentrated research and have constructed cpYFP which was fused with calmodulin (CaM) and M13 (26 residue peptide derived from a CaM bonding region of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase) (Blumenthal, D. K., &amp; Krebs, E. G. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 139, 115-126). Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-bound CaM (Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-CaM) and M13 peptide form a stable and compact complex, and the solution structure of this complex has been measured by multidimensional NMR (Ikura, M., Clore, G. M., Gronenborn A. M., Zhu, G. Klee, C. B. &amp; Bax, A. (1992) Science 256, 632-638). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, the present inventors have studied the fluorescence characteristic of a chimeric fusion protein composed of M13, cpYFP and CaM, and have found that the fluorescence characteristic varies according to a Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-dependent interaction between CaM and M13. In addition, it has been found that the behavior of spectral variation changes according to mutations which can influence the proton network of cpYFP. The present invention was completed on the basis of these findings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The embodiments and methods for carrying out the present invention are described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> (1) A fluorescent protein of the present invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a fluorescent protein having the following amino acid sequences (1) to (3) in order in the direction from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, wherein a fused fluorescent protein obtained by fusion of the fluorescent protein with a calcium binding protein and its target peptide can emit fluorescence which is dependent on Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> ion level; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> (1) an amnio acid sequence from the n<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>amino acid from the N-terminus to the C-terminus of a fluorescent protein selected from the group consisting of a green fluorescent protein or its mutant, a yellow fluorescent protein or its mutant, a cyan fluorescent protein or its mutant, a red fluorescent protein or its mutant, and a blue fluorescent protein or its mutant, provided that n represents an integer of 140 to 150; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> (2) a linker sequence of a sequence of 2 to 20 amino acids; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> (3) an amino acid sequence from the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>amino acid to the (n&minus;1)<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>amino acid from the N-terminus of the fluorescent protein described in (1) above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;a green fluorescent protein or its mutant; a yellow fluorescent protein or its mutant; a cyan fluorescent protein or its mutant; a red fluorescent protein or its mutant; and a blue fluorescent protein or its mutant&rdquo; used in the present specification has a meaning to include all known fluorescent proteins or their mutants. For example, GFP gene has been isolated and its sequence has also been determined (Prasher, D. C. et al.(1992), &ldquo;Primary structure of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein&rdquo;, Gene 111:229-233). There have also been numerous reports of amino acid sequences of other fluorescent proteins or their mutants, for example, as described in Roger Y. Tsin, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998. 67:509-44 and the literature cited therein. In Delagrave, S. et al. (1995), Red-shifted excitation mutants of the green fluorescent protein, Bio/Technology 13:151-154, there has been isolated a cloned Aequorea victoria GFP mutant having a red-shifted excitation spectrum. In Heim, R. et al. (1994), Wavelength mutations and posttranslational autoxidation of green fluorescent protein, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:12501-12504, there is reported a mutant (His from Tyr<highlight><subscript>66</subscript></highlight>) having blue fluorescence represented by BFP(Tyr<highlight><subscript>66</subscript></highlight>&rarr;His). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The fluorescent protein of the present invention adopts a structure having; the amino acid sequence from the n<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>amino acid from the N-terminus to the C-terminus of the above-described fluorescent protein on the N-terminus side (n represents an integer from 140 to 150); the amino acid sequence from the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>amino acid of the N-terminus to the n&minus;1 amino acid of the above-described fluorescent protein on the C-terminus side; and a linker sequence sandwiched between these two amino acid sequences. Altering the structure of a protein in this manner is also referred to as &ldquo;circular permutation.&rdquo; In the present invention, by applying circular permutation to known fluorescent proteins such as those described above, production of a novel fluorescent protein which is useful as a calcium ion indicator has been succeeded for the first time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The amino acid sequence of the linker sequence is not particularly limited as long as the produced fused fluorescent protein exerts the desired effect as a calcium ion indicator. It is preferable that the amino acid sequences comprises mainly relatively small side-chains. Also, amino acids having a hydrophilic side-chains are preferred. The number of amino acids is normally between 2-20, preferably 3-10, and more preferably 5-10. Examples of a linker sequence include Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO:4) or Val-Asp-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Thr-Gly (SEQ ID NO:5), although the linker sequence is not limited thereto. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;having a fluorescence characteristic that is equivalent to or greater than&rdquo; is used herein to mean that, the characteristic of fluorescence emitted dependent on Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> ion level by a fused fluorescent protein obtained by fusing a calcium binding protein and its target peptide to the fluorescent protein, is equivalent or greater. </paragraph>

There may be used any of a chemically synthesized protein, or a recombinant protein produced by a gene recombination technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the case of producing a recombinant protein, it is necessary to obtain the DNA encoding the protein. By utilizing the information of the amino acid sequence and the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NOS:1-3 of the sequence list herein, suitable primers can be designed, and by using those to perform PCR using a cDNA clone of various known fluorescent proteins as described above as a template, DNA fragments necessary to construct DNA encoding a fluorescent protein of the present invention can be prepared.

A fluorescent protein of the present invention can then be produced by introducing this DNA into a suitable expression system. Expression in the expression system is described later in the present specification. </paragraph>

When a filamentous bacterium is used as a host cell, transformation can be performed by integrating the DNA construct into the host chromosome and obtaining a recombinant host cell. Integration of the DNA construct into the host chromosome can be performed according to a known method such as homologous recombination or heterologous recombination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> When an insect cell is used as a host, a protein can be expressed by co-transfecting a recombinant gene transduction vector and a baculovirus into the insect cell to obtain a recombinant virus in the insect cell culture supernatant, and then infecting the recombinant virus into the insect cell (for example, as described in Baculovirus Expression Vectors, A Laboratory Manual, and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Bio/Technology, 6, 47 (1988), and the like). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As a baculovirus, for example, <highlight><italic>Autographa califomica </italic></highlight>nuclear polyhedrosis virus, which is a virus that infects Mamestra-family insects, and the like, can be used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> For example, in a case where a protein of the present invention was expressed in a solubilized form within cells, after culturing is completed, cells are recovered by centrifugation and suspended in a water-based buffer, then a cell-free extract is obtained by disrupting the cells by means of an ultrasonic homogenizer or the like. From the supernatant obtained by centrifuging the cell-free extract, a purified sample can be obtained using a conventional method for isolating and purifying a protein. Examples of the conventional method for isolating and purifying a protein include the use of, either alone or in combination, techniques such as solvent extraction, salting-out by ammonium sulfate or the like, desalting, precipitation by an organic solvent, anion exchange chromatography using a resin such as Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) Sepharose, cation exchange chromatography using a resin such as S-Sepharose (Pharmacia), hydrophobic chromatography using a resin such as Butyl Sepharose or Phenyl Sepharose, gel filtration using a molecular sieve, affinity chromatography, chromatofocusing, an electrophoresis method such as isoelectric focusing, and the like. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> (A-1) Gene Construction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The cDNA of cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) was constructed by three separate PCRS. First, the cDNA of the 3&prime; portion of EYFP(V68L/Q69K) (Miyawaki, A., Griesbeck, O., Heim, R. &amp; Tsien, R. Y. (1999) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>96, 2135-2140) was amplified with a sense primer containing a PstI site, and a reverse primer encoding a peptide linker GGSGG Second, the cDNA of the 5&prime; portion of EYFP(V68L/Q69K) was amplified with a sequence encoding the peptide linker GGSGG and a KpnI site to the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends, respectively. Finally, the entire cDNA of cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) was amplified with the PstI-and KpnI-site containing primers using a mixture of the first and second PCR fragments as the template. The restricted product was cloned in-frame into the PstI/KpnI sites of pRSET<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>(Invitrogen), yielding cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K)/pRSET<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. Then the cDNAs encoding M13 and CaM were amplified using primers containing 5&prime; BamHI and 3&prime; PstI sites, and 5&prime; KpnI and 3&prime; EcoRI sites, respectively. The restricted PCR fragments were ligated to the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends of cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) gene in pRSET<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>to yield the construct of pericam for bacterial expression. The modification of the linkers and site-directed mutagenesis at 148 and 203 in cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) were performed as previously described (Sawano, A. &amp; Miyawaki, A. (2000) <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>28, e78), to create flash-(SEQ ID NO.1), ratiometric-(SEQ ID NO.2) and inverse-(SEQ ID NO.3) pericams. The 5&prime; end of the pericam gene was modified by PCR to have a HindIII site followed by a Kozak consensus sequence (CCACCATG). The HindIII/EcoRI fragment encoding the pericam was subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The cDNAs coding for M13-EYFP(V68L/Q69K)(145-238) and EYFP(V68L/Q69K)(1-144)-CaM were obtained from flash-pericam cDNA and cloned into pcDNA3. Ratiometric-pericam-mt and ratiometric-pericam-nu were obtained by extending the ratiometric-pericam cDNA at the 5&prime; end with the sequence encoding the N-terminal 12 amino acid presequence of subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase (Rizzuto, R., Simpson, A. W., Brini, M &amp; Pozzan, T. (1992) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>358, 325-327), and at the 3&prime; end with the nuclear localization signal: PKKKRKVEDA, respectively. </paragraph>

Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> titrations were performed by reciprocal dilution of Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-free and Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-saturated buffers prepared by using O,O&prime;-Bis(2-aminoethyl)ethyleneglycol-N,N,N&prime;,N&prime;-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N&prime;,N&prime;-triacetic acid (EDTA-OH) or Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> (A-4) Mammalian expression and Imaging </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Two or three days after cDNA transfection with Superfect (QIAGEN), HeLa cells in HBSS buffer were imaged at 25&deg; C. on an Olympus IX-70 with a MicroMax-1300Y/HS interlined CCD camera (Roper scientific Inc.), controlled by MetaFluor/MetaMorph 4.0 software (Universal imaging). Single-wavelength imaging with flash-pericam, inverse-pericam and split-pericam used a 475DF35 excitation filter, a 505 DRLP dichroic mirror, and an HQ525/50 emission filter. Dual-excitation imaging with ratiometric-pericam used two excitation filters (480DF10 and 410DF10) which were alternated by a filter changer (Lambda 10-2, Sutter Instruments), a 505 DRLP-XR dichroic mirror, and a 535DF25 emission filter. Confocal images were carried out using a Fluoview FV500 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus) with an argon-ion laser (Omnichrome, Melles Griot). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> (B-1) Development of Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-sensitive circularly permuted GFP variants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> A YFP variant, EYFP(V68L/Q69K) (Miyawaki, A., Griesbeck, O., Heim, R. &amp; Tsien, R. Y. (1999) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>96, 2135-2140) was subjected to circular permutation. The original N- and C-termini were linked through a pentapeptide linker GGSGG, rendering Y145 and N144 new N- and C-termini, respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). With a hexa-histidine tag (His6-tag) attached at the N-terminus, the circularly permuted YFP (cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K)) was expressed in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and purified using the His6-tag. Spectra of purified proteins were all measured at pH 7.4 unless otherwise stated. The absorbance spectrum of cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) shows a major peak at 420 nm with a small shoulder near 500 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>), contrasting with the original EYFP(V68L/Q69K) peaking predominantly at 514 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, Miyawaki, A., Griesbeck, O., Heim, R. &amp; Tsien, R. Y. (1999) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>96, 2135-2140). This blue-shift suggests that the chromophore was protonated in cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K). The excitation spectrum had two peaks at 417 and 506 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>), which was reminiscent of the bimodal excitation spectrum of WT-GFP (Tsien, R. Y. (1998) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>67, 509-44). The protonated species of cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) absorbing around 420 nm fluoresced, while protonated species of most YFPs do not (Tsien, R. Y. (1998) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>67, 509-44). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Our initial attempt was to connect the C-terminus of CaM and N-terminus of M13 with the N- and C-termini of cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K), respectively. However, the resulting chimera protein did not show any response to Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>. Then, CaM and M13 were interchanged: cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) was fused to the C-terminus of M13 through a tripeptide linker SAG, and through a GTG linker to the N-terminus of CaM<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>containing the E104Q mutation of the conserved bidentate glutamate in the third Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> binding loop to glutamine (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Although the N-terminus of CaM and the C-terminus of M13 are 50 &angst; apart in their complex (Ikura, M., Clore, G. M., Gronenborn A. M., Zhu, G, Klee, C. B. &amp; Bax, A. (1992) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>256, 632-638), the chimeric protein was fluorescent and showed Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> sensitivity. The protein having a circularly permuted YFP and a CaM, was named &ldquo;pericam&rdquo;. When excited at 485 nm, the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-bound pericam showed an emission peak at 520 nm, 3 times brighter than the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-free pericam. On the contrary, neither absorbance nor fluorescence spectrum of cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) was sensitive to Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> To obtain pericams with a larger dynamic range, several amino acids involved in the proton network were optimized. Substitution of His203 for Tyr improved the dynamic range significantly. The new pericam, called &ldquo;flash-pericam&rdquo; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), exhibited an 8-times increase in the fluorescence with Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>). Together with two mutations which provide a better folding at 37&deg; C. (V163A and S175G), flash-pericam was designed to work as a single wavelength indicator of intracellular Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>. In the absence of Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, flash-pericam exhibited similar absorbance spectrum to that of cpEYFP(V68L/Q69K) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, broken line). Upon saturation with Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, the 490-nm absorbance peak increased at the expense of the 400-nm peak (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, solid line), indicating that association of the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-CaM with M13 peptide caused ionization of the chromophore, which resulted in a leftward shift of the pH-titration curve (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</cross-reference>). It should be noted that when the pH was high enough to ionize the chromophore, the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-bound flash-pericam (at pH&equals;9) was about twice as bright as the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-free one (at pH&gt;10). Besides the pH-titrability, therefore, the interaction between CaM and M13 might have direct steric effects on the chromophore, and change its ionization state or reduce its out-of-plane distortions that could result in enhanced radiationless decay. The letter possibility is likely, because Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> binding to flash-pericam increased the quantum yield by several times as well as the molar extinction coefficient around 490 nm (Table 1). The pH titration curve in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</cross-reference> also shows that the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-bound flash-pericam was alkaline-quenched (pH&gt;10), suggesting the collapse of such an incomplete &bgr;-can structure.

<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Most YFPs have a tyrosine or a histidine at position 203 and contain non-fluorescent protonated species absorbing at around 400 nm (Tsien, R. Y. (1998) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>67, 509-44). Also, fluorescence was hardly detectable when flash-pericam was excited at around 400 nm. On the other hand, phenylalanine at position 203 in YFP was shown to make the protonated species fluorescent. For example, excitation of YFP with Phe203 at 400 nm gave rise to a predominant emission peak at 455 nm (Dickson, R. M., Cubitt, A. B., Tsien, R. Y. &amp; Moerner, W. E. (1997) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>388, 355-358). Aiming for a dual-excitation ratiometric Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> indicator, we introduced Phe203 in flash-pericam. Again, the linkers and several amino acids proved critical to the optimization of protein folding and the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> sensitivity. After numerous constructs had been tested, &ldquo;ratiometric-pericam&rdquo; was derived from flash-pericam by introducing H203F, H148D, F46L, deleting a glycine before CaM, and replacing the GGSGG linker with VDGGSGGTG, between the original N- and C-termini (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). As was seen in flash-pericam, Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> binding promoted ionization of the chromophore in ratiometric-pericam. Therefoe, ratiometric-pericam exhibited a Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-dependent change in the absorbance spectrum similar to flash-pericam (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>), and the pH-titration curve was shifted leftwards with Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</cross-reference>). In contrast to flash-pericam, however, ratiometric-pericam had a bimodal excitation spectrum peaking at 415 and 494 nm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</cross-reference>), and the relative intensities of green fluorescence (511-517 nm) emitted when excited with 494- and 415-nm light was changed by about ten-fold between Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-saturated and Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-free forms (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</cross-reference>). The excitation ratio (494/415) showed a monophasic Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-dependency with an apparent dissociation constant (K&apos;d) of 1.7 &mgr;M and a Hill constant of 1.1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> During the semi-random mutagenesis on ratiometric-pericam, we found an interesting protein, which had a substitution D148T (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). In contrast to flash-pericam, the green fluorescence (513-515 nm) emitted when excited at 500 nm decreased to 15% with Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</cross-reference>). Thus, the protein has been named &ldquo;inverse-pericam&rdquo;. The binding of Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> to inverse-pericam may have promoted the protonation of the chromophore. However, the following results indicate this was not the case. At pH 7.4, Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> ion only blue-shifted the peak of absorbance spectrum from 503 to 490 nm, with a tiny hump around 400 nm unaltered (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C); the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> binding did not affect the protonation state of the chromophore. Also, both the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-bouad and Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-free inverse-pericams were pH-titrated in a similar way, however, in the ionized states (pH&gt;8), the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-free protein was seven-fold brighter than the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-bound form (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>). In fact, the quantum yield was decreased by 30% with Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> binding (Table 1). These results suggest that the change in fluorescence intensity would be explained mostly by direct effects of the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-related structural change on the chromophore. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> When each pericam was transfected into HeLa cells, the fluorescence was uniformly distributed throughout the cytosolic and nuclear compartments but excluded from the nucleoli, as expected for a 44 kDa protein, which can pass through the nuclear pores (for example, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). Thus, the pericams can report intracellular free Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentrations (&lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C show receptor-stimulated &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>oscillations in single HeLa cells expressing flash-pericam, ratiometric-pericam and inverse-pericam, respectively. In each case, the response began with a large spike, became sinusoidal, then converted into transient spikes and gradually declining frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Compared with the single-wavelength indicators (flash-pericam and inverse-pericam), ratiometric-pericam permits quantitative Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> imaging that can cancel out artifacts caused by indicator concentration and cell thickness or movement. In the presence of Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> ionophore, the application of a high concentration (5 mM) of extracellular Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, then BAPTA-AM and EGTA gave the maximum and minimum ratios (R<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>, respectively) for an in situ calibration (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, top). While the amplitude of the first spike was about 3 &mgr;M, that of the subsequent spikes was below 1 &mgr;M. The relatively weak Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> affinity allows for a more precise quantification of spike amplitudes than fura-2, the popular dual-excitation ratiometric Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The time course of inverse-pericam (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>) seems to be a symmetric image of the flash-pericam (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). However, inverse-pericam indicated relatively more sustained &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>increases (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference>). This is consistent with the finding that inverse-pericam had a higher affinity for Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> than flash-pericam; their Kd values were 0.2 and 0.7 &mgr;M, respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3J and 3L</cross-reference>). One advantageous feature of inverse-pericam is that its Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-free form has a high molar extinction coefficient and quantum yield at pH 7.4 (Table 1), which are almost comparable to those of enhanced GFP (Tsien, R. Y. (1998) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>67, 509-44). Thus, despite the unusual characteristics of dimming with Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, the use of inverse-pericam permits Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> imaging with a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the course of the improvement of pericams, folding efficiency at 37&deg; C. in mammalian cells was also an important factor. Inverse-pericam and ratiometric-pericam can be efficiently folded independently of temperature, while flash-pericam is better produced at 28-30&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> (B-3) Monitoring protein hereto-dimerization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> An intriguing question is whether the circularly permuted GFP variants can detect intermolecular associations. To address this, we split flash-pericam at the linker between the original N- and C-termini of EYFP(V68L/Q69K) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The two proteins (&ldquo;split-pericam&rdquo;) were co-expressed in HeLa cells. Although the chromophore of GFP is made of the tripeptide 65-67, its formation requires the entire &bgr;-can structure (Tsien, R. Y. (1998) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>67, 509-44). It was not clear, therefore, how efficiently the two peptide chains associated at the basal level of &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, and how much the mature chromophore was formed. In spite of such uncertainty, split-pericam was able to monitor the reversible association between CaM and M13 peptide. The temporal profile almost reflected &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>oscillations caused by ATP or histamine (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference>). However, split-pericam could not be used as a reliable Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> indicator: CaM and M13 peptide being separate, they are fully subject to cross-reaction with unlabelled CaM and CaM-binding proteins in cells. Our in vitro studies have revealed that the fused CaM and M13 in flash-pericam preferentially interact with each other. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> It has been controversial whether nuclear free Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentration (&lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) is regulated independently cytosolic free Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentration (&lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) (Malviya A. N. &amp; Rogue, P. J. (1998) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>92, 17-23). Comparative measurements of &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>have been carried out using synthetic fluorescent chelators. However, the cytosolic signal is often contaminated by signals from intracellular organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum, in which the chelators can be compartmentalized (Brown, G. R., Kohler, M &amp; Berggren, P. O. (1997) <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>325, 771-778). The Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> sensitive photoprotein, aequorin has been localized specifically in nucleus and cytosol (Badminton, M. N., Campbell, A. K. &amp; Rembold, C. M. (1996) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>271, 31210-31214; and Brini, M., Murgia, M., Pasti, L., Picard, D., Pozzan, T. &amp; Rizzuto, R. (1993) <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>12, 4813-4819), but it was proven difficult to image &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>in individual cells. To examine the propagation of Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> waves, we transfected HeLa cells with flash-pericam cDNA and observed the signals using high-speed confocal line-scanning microscopy equipped with an argon-ion laser. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows an optically-sectioned image of a cell expressing flash-pericam, which was always distributed throughout the cytosol and nucleus at the same protein concentration as mentioned above. Thus, the simple use of flash-pericam allowed us to compare the two Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentrations without concern on the difference in Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> buffering. A typical pattern of the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> propagation stimulated by histamine and detected by line-scanning is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. The Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> waves were traveled along the line indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> gives the time course measurement of &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>after bath-application of 1 &mgr;M histamine. No obvious difference in temporal profiles between &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>was evident; similar results were obtained from the experiments using video-rate scanning two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy (Fan, G.

<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Mitochondria are active participants in cellular Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> signaling. Mitochondria sequester Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> from cytosolic microdomains of high Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentration generated by the entry or release of Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> from intracellular stores. Although it is interesting to know how the &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>increases are relayed into mitochondria, only few studies have succeeded in simultaneous measurements of &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>and &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(free Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentration in mitochondria) in single intact cells (Ricken, S., Leipziger, J., Greger, R. &amp; Nitschke, R. (1998) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>273, 34961-34969). Synthetic fluorescent chelators are difficult to be differentially targeted. Thus the measurements have employed patch clamp procedures; for example, after accumulation of the permeant cation rhod-2 acetoxymethyl ester in mitochondria, other Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> dyes conjugated with dextran were loaded by whole cell dialysis (Babcock, D., Herrington, J., Goodwin, P. C., Park, Y. B. &amp; Hille, B. (1997) <highlight><italic>J. Cell Biol. </italic></highlight>136, 833-844), where the mitochondria were not bathed in the natural cytoplasm. On the other hand, aequorin is easily targeted (Rutter, G. A. Burnett, P., Rizzuto, R., Brini, M., Murgia, M., Pozzan, T., Tavare, J. M. &amp; Denton, R. M. (1996) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl.

<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> We measured &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>and &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>using ratiometric-pericams targeted to mitochondria and nucleus, respectively, in HeLa cells. Based on our finding that Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> signals passed freely from the cytosol to nucleus in HeLa cells, we measured &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>as the extra-mitochondrial Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> signal. This allows for simultaneous observations of intra- and extra-mitochondrial Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> signals to be performed, which were well separated spatially. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows 4 snapshots of a HeLa cell 0, 5, 10, and 65 seconds after perfusion with 1 &mgr;M histamine. The excitation ratios (480/410) measured in the two spots indicated in the 0 s image are overlaid (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>). A sustained increase in &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>was evoked, which was accompanied by a transient and synchronized increase in &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>. However, the peak of &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>lagged behind &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>by 5 to 10 seconds as reported (Ricken, S., Leipziger, J., Greger, R. &amp; Nitschke, R.

Although previous studies which compared &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>and &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>in whole cell patch mode reported delayed decrease in &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>, the recovery of &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>was rather fast in our experiments, consistent with the results of another experiment using intact cells (Ricken, S., Leipziger, J., Greger, R. &amp; Nitschke, R. (1998) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>273, 34961-34969). It is therefore possible that the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> extrusion from mitochondria might be regulated by cytosolic factors which were lost in the whole cell dialysis. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> also shows that during the falling phase, some mitochondria transiently took up more Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> than others as indicated by an arrow in the 65 s image. The local increases in &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>were reproducibly observed. In two HeLa cells with only mitochondrially-targeted ratiometric-pericam (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>), the single mitrochondria showing high &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>were clearly imaged (indicated by arrows). Each of the &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>rises appeared to last for about 10 seconds. Such different behaviors of mitochondrial populations in individual cells were revealed by a subcellular imaging of &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>using aequorin (Montero, M.

<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Two genetically-encodable fluorescent Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> indicators were previously reported: cameleon (Miyawaki, A., Llopis, J., Heim, R., McCaffery, J. M., Adams, J. A., Ikura, M. &amp; Tsien, R. Y. (1997) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>388, 882-887) and camgaroo (Baird, G. S., Zacharias, D. A. &amp; Tsien, R. Y. (1999) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>96, 11241-11246). Cameleon is a dual emission ratiometric Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> indicator that employs FRET with 2 GFP mutants of different color. Compared with cameleon, ratiometric-pericam shows greater responses to Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>. The ten-fold ratio of R<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>to R<highlight><subscript>min </subscript></highlight>of ratiometric-pericam inside HeLa cells, which is consistent with the excitation ratio (494/415) change obtained in vitro, is much greater than the 2-fold ratio of R<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>/R<highlight><subscript>min </subscript></highlight>of the improved yellow cameleon (Miyawaki, A., Griesbeck, O., Heim, R. &amp; Tsien, R. Y. (1999) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>96, 2135-2140). Ratiometric-pericam also guarantees a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, since it shows relatively high absorbance extinction coefficient and quantum yield, and efficient folding ability at 37&deg; C. In this example, mitochondrially-targeted ratiometric-pericam allowed us to monitor &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>in single mitochondria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Camgaroo is a Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-sensitive EYFP that has an insertion of calmodulin at a central site, and becomes 7-fold brighter upon saturation with Ca<highlight><superscript>2&deg;</superscript></highlight> like flash-pericam. However, due to its low affinity (Kd&equals;7 &mgr;M) for Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, camgaroo can not detect well the histamine-induced &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>spikes of up to 2 to 3 &mgr;M. By contrast, flash-pericam has a reasonably high affinity (Kd&equals;0.7 &mgr;M) for Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, thereby capable of sensing physiological changes in &lsqb;Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> By this example, we demonstrate that it is possible to change dramarically the Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-dependent behavior of pericam just by introducing subtle mutations in the amino acids close to the chromophore. Although, in most cases, pericam was randomly mutated, there were some rational mutations. One example was the substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at residue 203 (Y203F), for creating ratiometric-pericam. Crystallographic studies on the three pericams would give us more information for designing pericams with different behaviors or other cpGFP-based biosensors. Through more profound understanding on the proton network of GFP, cpGFPs should potentially become powerful tools, complementing the FRET technology. </paragraph>
