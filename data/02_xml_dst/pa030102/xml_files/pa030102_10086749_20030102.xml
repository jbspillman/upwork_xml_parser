<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to electrical fuses, and more specifically, to an electrical safety connector fuse having a plug intended for insertion into an outlet or socket of a domestic or similar electrical system, the connector fuse being intended to receive a plug to provide additional safety. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventional electrical systems used to provide electrical power (e.g. 110/220 V in US) in residences and other buildings use circuit breakers to provide protection against short circuits or similar malfunctions in the electrical system itself or in equipment attached thereto. Typically, a single set of wires enters a residence and is connected to a circuit breaker box containing a plurality of circuit breakers, each of which is connected to one of a plurality of electrical circuits which radiate out from the box. Each of these circuits supplies power to several different wall outlets, light fittings or other electrical devices. One or more or the circuit breakers within the box may be of the ground fault interrupter type to provide additional safety to outlets in bathrooms or outside the house, where they may be exposed to water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although circuit breakers are effective in preventing damage from many electrical malfunctions, they suffer from several problems. Firstly, the circuit breakers themselves are mechanical devices which may fail to open when a current greater than their rated load passes through them. Such failures may be caused, for example, by corrosion or accumulation of dirt and debris within the circuit breaker, especially since circuit breakers in private houses are rarely if ever inspected by professional electricians. Secondly, although the rating of a circuit breaker can be varied for the intended use of the circuit connected thereto, each circuit breaker typically controls several electrical outlets. Therefore, the circuit breaker may not be specific to each outlet or appliance, but instead supplies to the circuit as a whole. For example, a single outlet in a kitchen might be used to power both an under-cabinet fluorescent lamp, drawing less than 20 W, and an electric kettle, drawing 1500 W. A malfunction in the lamp which caused it to draw 500 W might well be dangerous, but would not trip the associated circuit breaker, which must be able to pass the 1500 W required by the kettle. Finally, circuit breakers, being mechanical devices, may not respond quickly enough to prevent an accidental electrocution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to the hazards of electrocution, there is the ever present danger of fires caused by overloaded circuits and/or shorting failures in appliances attached to circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For the foregoing reasons, many experts believe that fuses placed adjacent each appliance provide better safety protection than centrally located circuit breakers, and personal computers and other expensive consumer electronics are often sold with internal fuses. However, such fuses give rise to additional problems. Laymen may well be unaware that such fuses are present, and there is no indication on the exterior of the electronic device when the fuse has blown; the electronic device simply stops working. Also, even if the owner of the device discovers the blown fuse, the fuses are not well standardized, so there may be difficulty and delay in procuring a replacement fuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In view of these known disadvantages of both circuit breakers and internal fuses, so-called &ldquo;fused connectors&rdquo; have been developed. Such fused connectors are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,218,413 (Koch); 3,320,383 (Koetter); 3,924,914 (Banner); 4,178,061 (Ahroni); 4,575,704 (Pezold); and 5,137,473 (Nickola). Essentially, a fused connector comprises a conventional plug adapted to plug into an electrical socket and is provided with a socket into which the plug of an appliance is inserted. A fuse is connected between the prongs of the connector fuse and the socket so that if the appliance draws too much power the fuse will blow. The rating of the fuse can be varied depending upon the type of appliance with which the connector fuse is intended to be used. The aforementioned Banner patent suggests that a small lamp be connected between the live and neutral lines with the fused connector such that the light will be lit when the connector is inserted into an electrical socket but will go out when the fuse blows, thus providing a visual indicator of a blown fuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Known fused connectors suffer from several disadvantages. The fuse is accessible to users so that it is possible for a user to replace the original fuse with one having a different rating. Consequently, there is usually no visual indication of the rating of the fuse within the connector, which renders it difficult for the user to select a connector having a fuse rating appropriate for the particular appliance with which it is to be used. Also, when the connector is inserted into a socket, there is nothing to prevent a child from (or perhaps an incautious adult wielding a screwdriver) inserting a narrow metal object into the live receptacle intended to receive the live prong of a plug, and the child may receive a dangerous, and perhaps even fatal, electric shock before the fuse blows. In addition, some users, when inserting the fused connector into a socket, tend to hold it by the portion adjacent the prongs, and it is easy for the user&apos;s fingers to contact the live prong as it is being inserted into the socket, thus giving the user an electric shock. Finally, many fused connectors fail to provide any visual indication that a fuse has blown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Consequently, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an electrical safety connector which overcomes these disadvantages of prior art fused connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a safety connector fuse which can provide a reliable indication of the rating of the fuse therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a safety connector fuse which can provide a reliable indication when its fuse has blown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a safety connector fuse which renders it difficult for a user to suffer an electric shock by insertion of an object into the apertures intended to receive the plug of an electrical appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a safety connector fuse which renders it difficult for a user to suffer an electric shock as the safety connector fuse is being inserted into a socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other objects of the invention will be apparent and will appear hereinafter in the following detailed description when read in connection with the drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This invention provides an electrical safety connector fuse for insertion into a standard electrical socket having at least live and neutral prong receptacles. The safety connector fuse comprises a sealed, tamper-proof housing having live and neutral apertures arranged to receive the live and neutral prongs, respectively, of an electrical plug. The connector fuse further comprises live and neutral prongs extending outwardly from the housing at points spaced from the live and neutral apertures, the live and neutral prongs being arranged to engage the live and neutral prong receptacles, respectively, of an electrical socket, or the like. A fuse is disposed within the housing and electrically connected to its live prong. The connector fuse also comprises a live receptacle electrically connected to the fuse, and disposed within the housing adjacent the live aperture therein so as to engage the live prong of a plug passing through the live aperture, and a neutral receptacle electrically connected to the neutral prong, and disposed within the housing adjacent the neutral aperture therein so as to engage the neutral prong of a plug passing through the neutral aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the connector fuse of the present invention, at least part of the housing may be light-transmissive, and the connector fuse may be provided with means for emitting light disposed within the housing and adjacent the light-transmissive portion thereof, so that light emitted from the light emitting means is visible outside the housing, the light emitting means being electrically connected to the live and neutral receptacles so as to emit light when a potential difference exists between these receptacles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Also, the connector fuse in one aspect may comprise a blocking member disposed within the housing adjacent the live and neutral apertures therein, the blocking member having a neutral aperture extending therethrough and being movable between a closed position, in which it blocks the live and neutral apertures in the housing, and an open position, in which the neutral aperture of the blocking member is aligned with the neutral aperture of the housing, thereby allowing the live and neutral prongs of the plug to pass through the live and neutral apertures in the housing and engage the live and neutral receptacles within the housing. The blocking member is provided with biasing means for continuously biasing the blocking member towards its closed position. The blocking member also has a cam surface disposed adjacent its neutral aperture and arranged to be engaged by the neutral prong of the plug passing through the neutral aperture in the housing, so that contact between the neutral prong and the cam surface causes the blocking member to move to its open position under the force applied by the bias spring. The blocking member may be provided with a recess arranged so that, when the blocking member is in its closed position, the recess will lie adjacent the live aperture of the connector fuse, so that a portion of the live prong of a plug can be accommodated within the recess while the blocking member is still in its closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Also, the neutral prong of the connector fuse of the present invention may extend a greater distance from the housing than its live prong. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another preferred form of the present safety connector fuse, the live prong has an outward surface facing away from the neutral prong of the connector fuse, and at least a portion of this outward surface is formed from an electrically insulating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For reasons explained in detail below, the usefulness of providing electrically insulating material on the live prong of a plug is not confined to safety connector fuses. Thus, in another aspect, this invention provides an electrical plug having a housing and live and neutral prongs extending therefrom, the live prong having an outward surface facing away from the neutral prong, and at least a portion of this outward surface being formed from an electrically insulating material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The connector fuse of the present invention provides several safety features. The sealed, tamper-proof housing prevents user replacement of the fuse so that a user can be confident that any markings on the plug accurately indicate the rating of the fuse contained therein, thus assuring that the user can select an appropriately rated connector fuse for a particular appliance. The extra length of the neutral prong of the plug (when present) as compared with its live prong, ensures that the neutral prong will make contact with the neutral receptacle of the socket before the live prong of the plug makes contact with the live receptacle, so that the live receptacle of the connector fuse cannot go live before an appropriate connection has been made with the neutral line. The blocking member ensures that a user cannot receive an electric shock by inserting a narrow metal object into the live aperture in the connector fuse. The provision of electrically insulating material on the outward surface of the live prong helps to ensure that a user will not receive an electric shock by accidentally touching electrically conductive material in the live prong of the connector fuse as the fuse, or similarly equipped plug, is being inserted into a socket, as it is being pulled out of a socket, or is only partway in a socket. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has markings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on its upper and lower surfaces (see especially <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>) indicating the rating of the fuse (see below) contained within the housing. It is desirable that the markings be repeated in Braille so that the rating of the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can for used by the visually impaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> On its rear surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided with ground, neutral and live apertures <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively, generally similar to the apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the socket <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and arranged to receive the ground, neutral and live prongs, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> respectively of the plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of an electrical appliance (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). Although primarily designed for use with a three-pin plug, such as the plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can, of course, accommodate a two-pin plug, such as the polarized two pin plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. Polarized two pin plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; has a neutral prong <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; and a live prong <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>, each of the neutral and live prongs, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively, of the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has essentially the same form as the prongs of a conventional plug, namely that of elongate flat plates having two major surfaces, an inward surface which faces towards the other prong, and an outward surface which faces away from its opposing prong. A tip portion of each prong, remote from the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, bears an electrically non-conducting, preferably, polymeric coating <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which extends over both the inward and outward surfaces of the prong; conveniently, the coating <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be formed by injection molding around the metal tip of the prong. A root section of each prong, adjacent the housing, is formed from a conductive metal. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the inward and outward surfaces of these root section are provided with portions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of increased thickness so that their surfaces are coplanar with the surfaces of the polymeric coatings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so order that the inward and outward surfaces of the prongs, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, are substantially flat. This helps to ensure that the prongs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be smoothly inserted into and removed from an electrical socket without any tendency for the prongs to &ldquo;catch&rdquo; at the junction between the basal and tip portions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other approaches may be taken to provide the required insulating properties for the prongs, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, Teflon coatings may be applied in required thickness, shrink tubing may be used, or the surfaces may be treated to render them non-conducting where the material composition of the prongs permits it as, for example, by anodizing aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a modified safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; which differs from the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the arrangement of insulating material on the prongs. In safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;, a root section of the outward surfaces of the neutral prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; and the live prong (not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is coated with an electrically insulating material <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the inner surface being left uncoated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The insulating coatings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are designed to prevent accidental electric shocks as the connector fuses <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; are inserted into electrical sockets. Many people, when inserting a connector fuse into a socket, hold it by the portion of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent the prongs, and it is not unknown for the fingers of a user to contact the prongs of the connector fuse as the fuse is being inserted into the socket. Unless special provision is made, the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes live while the front face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is still some distance from the surface of the socket, and between this point and the point at which the front face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the connector fuse approaches so closely to the surface of the socket that a finger can no longer be inserted between the two, any contact between a finger of the user and the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the connector fuse will cause the user to receive an electric shock. This potential for electric shock is especially great for blind and visually-impaired people, who may need to locate the socket with their fingertips before inserting the connector fuse, and hence have their fingers close to the prongs of the connector fuse as it is being inserted into the socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the insulating coatings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is to prevent such electric shocks, though the manner in which this prevention is achieved is somewhat different in the two cases. The insulating coatings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on the tips of the prongs <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> render the tips non-conductive, so that the point at which the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> becomes live is delayed until the front face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is so close to the socket that a finger cannot be inserted between the two. The insulating coating <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, does not delay the point at which the live prong becomes live, but prevents a finger of a user from contacting a live conducting portion of the live prong. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It will be seen from the foregoing discussion that the insulating coatings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are in principle only required on the live prong of the plug. However, providing these coatings on both the live and neutral prongs involves minimal additional expense and provides an extra measure of security by guarding against the (not uncommon) case where the live and neutral receptacles of the socket are wired the wrong way round so that it is the supposedly neutral prong of the connector fuse which goes live as the connector fuse is inserted into the socket. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It will also be seen from the foregoing discussion that where the insulating coating is provided on the tips of the prongs, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the coating should cover both the inward and outward surfaces of the prongs in order to delay the point at which the prong goes live. On the other hand, where the insulating coating is provided on a root section of the prongs, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the coating need only to be provided on the outward surface, since it is almost impossible for a user to touch the inward surface of the prong as the connector fuse is inserted into the socket. The insulating coating may cover only the root section of the outward surface, leaving the tip portion of the outward surface uncoated and electrically conductive, or the coating may cover the whole outward surface of the prong; this does not hinder the ability of the prong to make proper electrical contact with the receptacle within the socket since conventional receptacles make electrical contact with both the inward and outward surfaces of a prong (cf. the discussion below regarding contact between the receptacles of the safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the prongs of an appliance plug). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It will readily be appreciated that everything that has been said above about the possibility of a user receiving an electric shock when inserting a connector fuse of the present invention into a socket is equally applicable to insertion of a conventional plug into a socket. Accordingly, it is within the scope of the present invention to provide insulating coatings similar to the coatings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> discussed above on conventional plugs as well as the safety connector fuses of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The internal components of the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed from upper and lower sections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, respectively. These sections are fixedly secured together by ultra-sonic welding, adhesive, or other suitable means of permanent attachment to form the final tamper-proof housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The ground aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed in the upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, while the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the live aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are formed in the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, but with small recesses <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A being formed in the upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A to provide the proper height for the apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 12</cross-reference> also show that the neutral prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is integral with a neutral receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comprising a pair of parallel metal leaves joined by a connecting section <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A. Receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is accommodated within a chamber <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed in the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. At the point where it passes through a slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, the neutral prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided with a section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of enlarged cross-section, the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> similarly having a complementary configured section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of enlarged cross-section, the interaction between the section <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> serving to retain the prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the correct position relative to the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. (When the complete housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed by the union of the sections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, the upper face of the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is of course closed by the adjacent surface of the upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, thus preventing vertical movement of the neutral prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>.) The neutral prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is also provided with a side plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which lies parallel and close to the receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a corrugation <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> adjacent the side plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends through a slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) in the lower portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the portion of the prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which passes through the slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of enlarged cross-section. Although not visible in the drawings, the slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has essentially the same form as the slot <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, having a section of enlarged cross-section, which accommodates the section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thus retaining the prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in its correct position relative to the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Unlike the neutral prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not integral with its associated live receptacle (discussed separately below). Instead the rearward end of the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> terminates in a side plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, of similar form to the side plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and a main section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> provided with a corrugation <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises a live receptacle (generally designated <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) which, as already mentioned, is separate from the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The live receptacle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has essentially the form of a squared-off &ldquo;U&rdquo;, having a first limb section <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which forms the actual live receptacle and which is essentially identical in form to the neutral receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, comprising two parallel metal leaves joined by a connecting section <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>A. The live receptacle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also has a base section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which is provided with a corrugation <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and a first auxiliary plate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> facing this corrugation <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, the auxiliary plate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> being joined to the base section <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> by a connecting section (not shown) generally similar to the connecting section <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>A. Finally, the second limb of the live receptacle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a spring section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, provided with a corrugation <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and a second auxiliary plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> facing the corrugation <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the second auxiliary plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> being joined to the spring section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by a connecting section <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) generally similar to the connector <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>A. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is molded to provide a block <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> around which the U-shaped live receptacle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> fits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The various corrugations, side plates and auxiliary plates already mentioned serve to hold electrical connectors associated with a lamp and a fuse of the safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the side plate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the corrugation <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> clamp between them an electrical conductor <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> leading to a lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A second conductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> leads from the lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a resistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, from the opposed side of which extends a third conductor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the free end of which is clamped between the corrugation <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and the second auxiliary plate <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. A fourth conductor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is clamped between the corrugation <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and the first auxiliary plate <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and runs to one terminal of a fuse <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. From the opposed terminal of this fuse <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a fifth conductor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends downwardly and is clamped between the side plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the corrugation <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Thus, the only electrical connection between the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the live receptacle <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is via the conductors <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the fuse <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A circuit diagram of the safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates how this circuit diagram is modified in a two-pin version of the connector fuse in which the ground prong <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When the safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into a wall socket or outlet with the fuse intact, the lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are connected across the live and neutral lines, and the lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will light. However, if the fuse <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> blows, the lamp will be extinguished or will not turn on, thus providing a visual indication of the blown fuse, since the lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is visible through the light-transmissive housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The lamp <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are accommodated within the chamber <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> provided in the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the housing and an extension <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) of this chamber in the upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A. It will be apparent that the fuse and light may be provided as an integrated circuit with the light being in the form of an LED or the like whose color may be used to code the rated value of the fuse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, adjacent a rear wall <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the housing is provided with a chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>; an extension <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>A of this chamber is provided in the upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A so that the chambers <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>A form a single chamber when the complete housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is assembled. The chamber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has essentially the form of a flat cuboid, communicating on one side with the neutral and live apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively, and communicating on the opposed side via slots <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> with the chamber <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The neutral aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the slot <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the neutral receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are aligned with each other, and the live aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the slot <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the live receptacle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are also aligned with each other. The central slot <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> allows the spring section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to pass therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When the safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into the socket <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), a user, absent the safety features to be discussed next, could otherwise insert a metal object through the live aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the slot <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> into the live receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and receive an electric shock. To remove this risk of electric shock, a blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (which may alternatively be referred as a gate or shutter) is slidably mounted within the chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, this shutter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> extending into the chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>A in the upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A when the complete housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is assembled. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has substantially the form of a flat, rectangular plate through one end of which passes a neutral aperture <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> large enough to enable the neutral prong <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> respectively) to pass therethrough. Part of the wall of the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is inclined at approximately 45&deg; to the thickness of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to form a cam surface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The end of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> remote from the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> has a section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of reduced thickness, thus leaving a recess <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) between this section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the inner wall of the rearward portion of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, this recess <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> extending to a free edge (the left-hand edge in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>) of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. A recess <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 13</cross-reference>B) is formed in the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B adjacent this free edge of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and a projection <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is provided on the inner surface of the rearward portion of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, this projection <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> extending into the recess <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</cross-reference>A, the surface of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> facing the neutral and live receptacles, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, respectively, is provided with a recess <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> into which extends the free end of the spring section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The spring section serves to bias the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in one direction, to the left as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the ground prong <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> passes through a slot <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, provided in the front wall of upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A, and is integral with a U-shaped ground receptacle <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, which is accommodated within the chamber <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; formed in the upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A of the housing. A tongue <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is provided on the lower section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and extends into the slot <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> when the complete housing is assembled, thus holding the ground prong <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in its correct position. As may been seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 8</cross-reference>, the chamber <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>&prime; also accommodates part of the fuse <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A is molded to form two locating blocks <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> which retain the ground receptacle <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in position. The ground receptacle <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> lies adjacent the ground aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the upper section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A so that the ground prong of an appliance plug can pass through the ground aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and contact the ground receptacle <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. (The blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> does not extend upwardly as far as the ground aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and thus, the ground aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> remains open regardless of the position of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> within the chamber <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be used with either a two-pin plug or a three-pin appliance plug, since in the latter case the neutral prong of the appliance plug simply enters the aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and contacts the ground receptacle <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The operation of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> will now be described in detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10, 13A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>B. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 13</cross-reference>A, the placement of the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is such that when no plug is inserted into the neutral and live apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the spring section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> pushes the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to a closed position (to the left in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and to the right in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>), in which the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is not aligned with the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this position, the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> blocks the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, with only a portion of the cam surface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> remote from the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> lying adjacent the neutral aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Also in this position, section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> blocks the live aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the housing, with the free edge of the section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> remaining within the recess <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, in this closed position, the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> blocks both the neutral and live apertures, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in the housing. Furthermore, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, the relative positions of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on the one hand, and the recess <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and projection <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> on the other, render it very difficult if not impossible to insert an object into the live aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and move the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> from its closed position, thus gaining access to the live receptacle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Since the end of section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is received within the recess <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, one cannot move the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> by pushing a screwdriver or similar device past the edge of the blocking member. In addition, the presence of the projection <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> prevents a user moving the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> by pushing an object into the live aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at an inclined angle and pushing on the &ldquo;step&rdquo; where the section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the blocking member is joined to the remainder of this member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When the plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; is inserted into the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>A, the interaction between the tip of the neutral prong <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; of the plug and the cam surface <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> causes the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to move against the bias of the spring section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>. As the plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; moves in the direction of arrow A, the tip of the live prong <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; enters into, and is accommodated within, the recess <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> adjacent section <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Thus, the presence of recess <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> allows the outlet of the present invention to be used with a plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; having neutral and live prongs <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; of equal length without contact between the live prong <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; and the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> interfering with the normal insertion of the plug into the connector. Eventually, the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> moves to an open position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>B, allowing the neutral prong <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; to pass through the apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> into the neutral receptacle <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, while the live prong <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; passes through the aperture <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, past the end of the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and through the aperture <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> into the live receptacle <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. (Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference>, if a three-pin plug is used, the ground prong <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, of course, simultaneously passes through the aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) into the ground receptacle <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>.) As the plug <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>&prime; is withdrawn from the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the movements of the various parts are reversed, and the spring section <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> restores the blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to its closed position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>. Preferably, the spring constant is chosen so that blocking member <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> closes with an audible &ldquo;snap&rdquo; to indicate closure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The connector fuses <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; described above are effective in achieving the objects of the present invention and are very suitable for general use, where it is desirable to be able to remove and replace connectors fuses easily in order to use different connector fuses with different appliances. However, in certain circumstances, for example in houses where very young children are present, or in nursing homes or hospitals occupied by people who may not be in full possession of their faculties, it may be desirable to modify the connector fuses so that they cannot readily be removed from the sockets into which they are inserted, thus preventing an unprotected electrical socket being exposed, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> illustrate connector fuses of this type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates a double safety connector fuse (generally designated <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) which essentially comprises two connector fuses <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B, each of which is identical to the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> previously described, except that the housings of the connector fuses <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B are integral with a plate <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, from the periphery of which extends, in the same direction as the prongs of the fuses <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B, a flange <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is intended for use with a conventional double electrical outlet of the type found in homes and offices. Such an outlet has three main sections, the first of which is a box, which is secured to a wall stud or other fixed part of a building. The box has substantially the form of a hollow cuboid with its front face (which is flush with the surface of the surrounding wall) removed and with an aperture through which an electrical cable is passed into the box. The outlet also comprises an insert, which comprises the electrical sockets themselves and terminals for the conductors within the cable, this insert normally being secured within the box by screws which pass through apertures on the insert into threaded sockets provided on the top and bottom edges of the box. Finally, the outlet comprises a face plate which covers the openings between the periphery of the insert and the edges of the box and contacts the wall surface surrounding the box, this face plate normally being held in position by a single screw which passes through an aperture in the center of the face plate, between the two electrical outlets, and into a threaded socket provided in the center of the insert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is used in place of the conventional face plate. The face plate and its associated screw <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> are first removed from the outlet, and the prongs of the fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are inserted into the two electrical sockets. The screw <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is then reinstalled, thus securing the fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in position and preventing manual removal thereof. The dimensions of the fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are arranged so that once the screw <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> has been tightened, the free edge of the flange <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is in contact with the wall surface surrounding the box, thus fulfilling the same function as the conventional face plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> illustrates a further safety connector fuse (generally designated <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>) which is generally similar to the connector fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. However, the connector fuse <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> provides only a single safety connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A, and has a flange <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> having an aperture <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> passing therethrough. This aperture <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> provides access to the lower socket of the outlet, when the fuse <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is installed in the same manner as the fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, namely, by removing the conventional face plate and associated screw <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, inserting the prongs of the fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> into the upper socket, and replacing the screw <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a further safety connector fuse (generally designated <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>) of the present invention. This fuse <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is essentially a modified version of the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> described above which can be secured to an electrical outlet to prevent manual removal of the connector use. For this purpose, a lug <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is provided on the lower surface of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, this lug <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> having an aperture <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> extending therethrough. The dimensions of the lug <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> are arranged so that when the fuse <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is inserted into the upper socket of a double outlet, the aperture <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> overlies the central socket into which the screw <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is inserted to secure the face plate <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> of the outlet. The socket <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is secured to the outlet by first removing the screw <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> (but not the face plate <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>), inserting the socket <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> into the upper socket of the outlet, and reinserting the screw <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> illustrates a quadruple safety connector fuse (generally designated <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>) of the present invention which is very similar to the connector fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> but which has two additional connector fuses <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>D. The fuse <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> has a plate <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and a flange <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> which are identical, apart from dimensions, to the corresponding parts of the fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The fuse <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is secured to an electrical outlet in the same manner as the fuse <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The fuse <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is intended for use with a quadruple electrical outlet, and is consequently provided with four set of prongs (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). However, if desired the fuse <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> could be adapted for use with a double electrical outlet by being provided with only two sets of prongs and appropriate internal conductors to connect these two set of prongs to the four sets of receptacles adjacent the four sockets of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference> illustrate modifications which may be made to the housing of a safety connector fuse of the present invention to facilitate ultrasonic welding of the two halves of the housing. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</cross-reference> show a connector fuse <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> generally similar to the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> previously described, the prongs of this fuse being omitted for ease of illustration. The fuse <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> has a housing formed from an upper section <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>A and a lower section <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>B, which are secured together to form the final housing by ultrasonic welding. To facilitate such welding, the upper section <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>A is provided, on one of its side surfaces, with a hemicylindrical recess <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, which terminates just short of the lower end of the upper section <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>A, thus leaving a thin plate <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> at the lower end of the upper section <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>A. The lower section <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>B is provided at its upper end with a small projection <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> located so that, when the upper and lower sections <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>B are aligned correctly to form the final housing, the projection <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> lies adjacent the thin plate <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>. The plate <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> and projection <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> concentrate ultrasonic energy and thus facilitate ultrasonic welding of the two sections of the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows a connector fuse (generally designated <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) which is generally similar to the connector fuse <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> previously described but which has a neutral prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; which projects from the front face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a greater distance than the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;, while the ground prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; projects by a greater distance than the neutral prong <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;. The difference &Dgr; between the projections of the live and neutral prongs is desirably at least about 1 mm to assure minimum spacing between the front face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and socket <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) at the time the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; makes electrical contact. The reduces the possibility for physical contact of a user with the live prong <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; at the time of being powered up because this prong is relatively less accessible than it otherwise would be if longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> It will readily be apparent to those skilled in the art that numerous changes and modifications can be made to the preferred embodiments of the invention described above without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, it is not necessary that the whole housing of the connector fuse be transparent; a limited transparent, or even translucent, area on the housing will suffice provided light emitted from the light emitting means is visible from outside the housing. Also, although the preferred embodiments of the invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings use a resistor in series with the light emitting means, such a resistor may not be necessary with certain types of lamp or other light emitting means. Furthermore, in applications where, because of the position of the safety connector fuse, it might be difficult to read the markings thereon, the color of the light emitted might be varied to indicate the rating of the fuse. Moreover, although all the illustrated embodiments are three-pin, having three prongs for insertion into a socket and three apertures for receiving a three-pin appliance plug, it will readily be seen that the ground prong, the ground aperture and the ground receptacle could be omitted to provide a two-pin connector fuse. Therefore, it is intended that the embodiments described herein be considered as illustrative and not be construed in a limiting sense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it will be seen that the present invention provides a safety connector fuse which offers a high level of safety in that the user can be assured as to the rating of the fuse in the plug, thus enabling the user to choose a plug of the correct rating for any intended application. The connector fuse of the invention can provide a visual indication when its fuse has blown and a high degree of protection against fires due to overloading and shorts and electric shocks caused by objects being accidentally inserted into the connector. It will be appreciated that the connector fuse may also beneficially be used as a night light to provide guidance throughout structures when their principal lighting has been turned off for the night. </paragraph>
