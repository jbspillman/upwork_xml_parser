<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) device irradiates a biological tissue with low coherence light, obtains a high resolution tomogram of the inside of the tissue by low-coherent interference with scattered light from the tissue, and is provided with an optical probe which includes an optical fiber having a flexible and thin insertion part for introducing the low coherent light. When the optical probe is inserted into a blood vessel or a patient&apos;s body cavity, the OCT enables the doctor to observe a high resolution tomogram. In a optical probe, generally, a fluctuation of a birefringence occurs depending on a bend of the optical fiber, and this an interference contrast varies depending on the condition of the insertion. The OCT of the present invention is provided with polarization compensation means such as a Faraday rotator on the side of the light emission of the optical probe, so that the OCT can obtain the stabilized interference output regardless of the state of the bend. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical imaging device which irradiates the subject with low coherence light, to produce a tomogram of the subject, from data on light scattered by the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recent U.S. Pat. No. 5,321,501, for example, discloses a device which can obtain optical information from the inside of the tissue, in order to diagnose the biological tissue, and which performs optical coherence tomography (OCT) of interference type, using low coherence light, to produce a tomogram of the subject. U.S. Pat. No. 5,321,501 also discloses an optical probe which has a flexible insertion unit to be introduced into the patient&apos;s body cavity, and which enables the doctor to introduce the insertion unit into a blood vessel, using an optical probe that includes a single mode fiber for sending low coherence light to the inside so that the doctor can observe the inside of the patient&apos;s body cavity, using a catheter or endoscope. When introduced into the patient&apos;s body cavity, the optical probe is necessarily bent according to the tortuosity of the body cavity. Because of the bending, stress-induced birefringence is induced in the optical fiber which varies according to the extent of the bending. In OCT, the doctor uses an interference signal of a reference beam with reflection from the subject, to observe the subject. It is necessary, generally, to orient polarization of the reflection from the subject, toward that of the reference beam so that interference with the reference beam may be maximized. The stress-induced birefringence varies depending on the bending in the patient&apos;s body cavity; polarization, therefore, varies depending on the bending. As introduced into the patient&apos;s body cavity, the insertion unit varies interference contrast. The doctor may turn an integrated irradiation optical system that includes the single mode fiber. Every rotation of the bent system, particularly in such cases, causes a great variation in the stress-induced birefringence of the fiber. Interference contrast varies, so that detection sensitivity greatly varies depending on the direction of rotary scanning. Such a great variation is a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Polarization insensitive fiber optic Michelson interferometer&rdquo; (Electr. Lett. Vol. 27, pp. 518-519, 1991) discloses a method of inserting an element that rotates polarization by 45 degrees in a non-reciprocal manner such as a Faraday rotator, in order to compensate for a variation in interference contrast due to the fluctuations in stress-induced birefringence of such a fiber. A general Faraday rotator, however, requires a garnet crystal, and magnetic material that provides a magnetic field for the garnet crystal. It is impossible to provide such substances at the narrow probe tip to be introduced into the patient&apos;s body cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;In vivo video rate optical coherence tomography&rdquo; (A. M. Rollins et al., Internet, 1998 Optical Society of America) discloses a method of high-speed scanning of an interference location in OCT, with the reference arm group delay mechanism using a galvanometer mirror. To scan the location at a high speed by rotating the mirror, the inertia of the mirror will dictate that the rotational position of the mirror, if plotted with respect to time, would approach a sine wave oscillation. The depth scan of the interference location is proportional to the mirror rotational position. Because the mirror rotates first in one direction and then in the other, it is difficult to reproduce a two-dimensional image from the obtained interference signals. If the device uses an interference signal obtained by scanning in only one direction, it will neglect half the actually obtained signal data. In such cases, if the doctor continues rotary scanning of the optical system in the optical probe, he or she will provide only half the resolution and dynamic range for a two-dimensional image. Such a decrease in resolution and dynamic range is a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned high-speed scanning, the use of a resonant scanner, for example, ensures that the time vs. scanning angle curve is a sine wave, not linear. A two-dimensional position and intensity graph, however, may be used to represent an interference signal. Otherwise a shaded image may be used to express intensity as shades, based on the two-dimensional interference locations and detection positions. In such cases, to display interference signals accurately, it is impossible to use the interference signals obtained in time series, because the interference signals are linear with respect to time, and because the interference location is nonlinear with respect to time. A tomogram of the biological tissue inside, for example, may be produced. In such cases, if the device fails to indicate accurately the interference location and the detection position, the image produced will be warped, and it is impossible to accurately measure length with a scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As described above, the device may use a nonlinear scanning means such as a resonant scanner. Depending on the scanning angle, in such cases, the Doppler frequency (which characterizes the interference signal produced) varies in proportion to the scanning speed of the interference location. Optical heterodyne detection in OCT uses this Doppler frequency for detection; therefore, it ensures high signal-to-noise ratio. If the scanning is nonlinear, the Doppler frequency may vary. In such cases, if the frequency characteristics of the demodulator circuit are set so that the demodulator can detect all possible interference frequencies in a wide range, then the detection will include excess noise, and result in a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio. The inferior signal-to-noise ratio is a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> If the subject is scanned in a two-dimensional manner, methods of enlarging a part of the displayed image include: a method of cutting unnecessary parts away from that part; and a method of changing the scanning range. Changing the scanning range may require adjusting the speed of scanning the interference location, to the change in scanning range. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, scanning the interference location may be slowed. In these cases, the Doppler frequency may also vary; therefore, setting the frequency characteristics of the demodulator will pose a similar problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,321,501, an optical probe to be introduced into the patient&apos;s body cavity, generally, needs to be detachable from the observation device body for the purpose of cleaning and sterilizing. If detachable, a broken optical probe can be easily replaced with a new one. During assembly, single mode fibers undergo various stresses. Consequently, when provided in each optical probe, each single mode fiber may produce a distinct intrinsic birefringence. Whenever replacing probes, the doctor has to use a polarization plane adjustment means to orient, toward polarization of the reference beam, polarization of reflection that can be obtained by the optical probe, from the subject. It is necessary to maximize contrast of interference with the reference beam. The work is troublesome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As disclosed in &ldquo;In vivo video rate optical coherence tomography&rdquo; (A. M. Rollins et al.), a galvanometer mirror or resonant scanner mirror may be used for high-speed scanning of the interference location in OCT. Because of the inferior temperature characteristics, the galvanometer mirror and the resonance scan mirror vary the scanning range and scanning speed, depending on the variation in temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As disclosed in the above cited Rollins et al. Publication &ldquo;In vivo video rate optical coherence tomography&rdquo;, a galvanometer mirror or resonant scanner mirror may be used for high-speed scanning of the interference location in OCT. In such cases, in order to maximize drive speed, the mirror will be driven so that the drive curve may approach a sine wave. As described above, the nonlinear drive results in a nonlinear relationship between the interference location and interference signals obtained in time series. Such a nonlinear relationship is difficult to handle. The inferior signal-to-noise ratio, aggravated by setting the frequency characteristics of a demodulator, is a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When displayed on the screen, an OCT tomogram is drawn using optical length, which greatly differs depending on the medium. As the medium, air, for example, has a refractive index n of approximately 1; whereas the biological tissue has a refractive index n of 1.3 to 1.5. When displayed on the screen, optical length is n times the actual length. Such difference causes a significant error, and that is a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The outer sheath with optical permeability is generally made of a resin tube such as fluorine resin and polyamide (nylon). Since the refractive index of the resin tube greatly differs from that of air sealed between the optical element and the outer sheath, significant light reflection occurs at the index of refraction interface between the air inside the outer sheath and the sheath material itself. Similarly, significant reflection also occurs at the index of refraction interface between the outer sheath surface and the air, water or gastrointestinal fluid outside the sheath. The reflection attenuates the irradiation and observation light, thus degrading the S/N ratio for observation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Since OCT, in principle, detects the correlation between the reflection intensity on the optical path and the optical path length, presence of two faces with intense reflection in the vicinity will cause a degradation in the amount of optical power available for image formation. They will also result in the formation of reflections at the probe sheath surfaces which could be large compared to any tissue reflections, and will thus tend to overwhelm the dynamic range of the detection electronics and make it difficult to display weak tissue reflections on the same screen as the strong sheath reflections. Furthermore, multiple reflections may form between the reflecting surfaces, resulting in the generation of ghost images of the tissue where no actual reflection surface exists. The observation light, which is light scattered and reflected by the living body, is relatively weak light when compared with the above mentioned reflection intensity, the ghost will considerably deteriorate the observation performance. This is especially damaging if the ghost image appears at the same location as the actual tissue image, in which case there is no simple way to separate them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, &ldquo;In vivo Endoscopic Optical Biopsy with Optical Coherence Tomography&rdquo; (G. J. Tearny et. al, Science vol.276) disclosed an OCT optical probe which has a transparent sheath to cover and seal up to the optical element such as the prism at the tip end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The prior art suffers from problems that when the endoscope with the probe inserted through its insertion opening is inserted into a body cavity or when the probe is bent, the rotating support for the optical element at the tip end comes into contact with the interior of the outer sheath and damages the interior, that optical characteristics of the outer sheath are degraded by irregular reflection of lights at the damaged portion, and that the observation quality deteriorates as the OCT irradiation light emitted by the optical element and observation light reflected by the living body are shielded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Even when the damage on the sheath does not coincide with the irradiation or observation light position, the damage appears at the location of observation light since the rotary sheath reciprocates against the outer sheath because of the bending shape of the probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, probe sheaths made from such materials as fluorine resin and polyamide have very poor optical quality, such that they have randomly spaced internal index of refraction boundaries, internal striations, and particulate scatterers which act to degrade the wavefront of light propagating though them and to scatter a significant portion of light into unpredictable directions. Since the probe design depends upon light being directed to a diffraction-limited focussed spot in the tissue and then being re-coupled into the single mode fiber on the return path, any passage through elements which degrade the optical wavefront or scatter light severely degrades the re-coupling of image-forming light into the probe and the heterodyne efficiency of the OCT interferometer. Thus, a probe window of high optical quality would be highly advantageous to obtain the best possible OCT image quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, recently an OCT device has been developed for observing tomography structure of a living body by using a low coherence light length of interference. For observing the tomography structure by using the low coherence light, a method is used for dividing light from a light source for generating the low coherence light into signal light and reference light, irradiating the signal light to an observed object, after that, composing the reflected light from the object measured with the reference light again, and detecting the interference light between both of them. Then, as it is possible to obtain the interference light at only the place that length of an optical path of a flux of the signal light is agreed with that of the reference light when changing the length of the optical path on the side of the reference light, it is possible to obtain the same effect as scanning the place for observing the measured object by changing the length of the optical path on the side of the reference light, and to possible to observe the tomography structure of the measured object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example that of OCT is applied to an endoscope. The light from a low coherence light source <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is combined with a single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and is led to a coupler <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The light is divided the light into the signal light <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the reference light <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> by the coupler <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The light on the side of the reference light <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> divided is lead via lens <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> to a means <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> (scanning mirror) for changing the optical path <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> by the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The light returned from the means for changing the optical path <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is returned to the coupler <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> by the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> On one hand, the light divided on the side <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the signal light is led to the end optical system <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> on the side of the signal light <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> different from on the side of the reference light <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, irradiated to the measured object, reflected from the measured object, returned, therefore, is composed to the light returned from the side of the reference light by the coupler <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> through the end optical system on the side of measuring and the single mode fiber again. The composed light returned on the side of referring and measuring is led to a detector <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> by the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the interference signal is detected by the detector <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view showing non-prior art enlarged details of an end part on the side of measuring in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The end optical system <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is constructed at the end of the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. In the end optical system, a lens unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> contains a refractive index distribution lens (Gradient Index lens: GRIN lens) <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> for gathering the light to a living body, a Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for canceling the influence of polarization caused by bending of the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and prism <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> for changing the direction of the light. Further, the cylindrical transparent sheath <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> covers the outside of the lens unit. As shown by arrow <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and the lens unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are rotated as the longitudinal direction (the central axis of the cylindrical sheath <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>) is an axis. As above mentioned by rotating the mechanism, it is possible to observe the measured object not only in the cross-sectional direction but also radially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the above described related art, the end optical system <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> has a problem in that after light outgoing from a single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is reflected several times on the boundary surface of a optical elements such as a Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, a refractive index lens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, prism <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and sheath <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and returned to the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> again, an image of a living body and ghost overlaps and quality of the picture is degraded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The reasons for that are described in reference FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(A)-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(E). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B: Light b is then again reflected by the rear surface of the refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and is directed toward the object. Light a, however, passing as it was in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, proceeds through the Fadaday rotator (FR) <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and the prism <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> to the middle of the sheath <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> and the tissue <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> of a living body. </paragraph>

Then, light a arrived at the boundary surface between the prism <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and the FR <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and overlaps light b. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>E: Overlapped light a and light b is return to the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In case of the conditions above mentioned, the signal light from the tissue <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> of the living body and light b reflected in the end optical system several times overlap, and an image when seeing the tomography structure of the living body is that the image <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) of the ghost due to light b overlaps the image <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of the tissue of the living body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The image <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of the ghost is often remarkable when the number of times of reflection on the end surface of the optical element is less than three times. Generally, as strength of reflection per surface of the optical element is fromis &minus;20 dB to &minus;30 dB relative to the incident light, when the number of times of reflection on the end surface of the optical element is three times, total strength of reflection is from &minus;60 dB to &minus;90 dB, and when the number of times of reflection is four times, it is from &minus;80 dB to &minus;120 dB. On the other hand, strength of the signal from the living body is &minus;50 dB to &minus;70 dB. Therefore, when the number of times of reflection on the end surface of the optical element is even less than three times, it can be almost the same level as the strength of the signal of the living body and causes difficulty in observation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The path of the reflective light as above mentioned is an example; multiple reflection in the real end optical system occurs in various paths except besides the path as above mentioned. Particularly, there are problems when the shape of the sheath is cylindrical because it is difficult to treat to prevent reflection from the surface of the sheath, and it is easy then for light reflected three times to overlap on the observing position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> One more problem of the above mentioned end optical system is the structure of the end optical system in that the light outgoing from the single mode fiber is reflected on the boundary surface of the optical element and the reflected light is directly returned to the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. If the such structure as is called the structure of once reflection, &ldquo;structure of once reflection&rdquo;, in the optical system, the structure of once reflection will reflect the reflected light from all the boundary surfaces except the end surface on the side of the fiber of the refractive index distribution lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the structure of the optical system is the structure of once reflection and the light reflected from the end surface of the optical element is incident on the single mode fiber, unnecessary light will return to the single mode fiber and an S/N ratio when detecting the interference signal will be significantly reduced. Therefore, if the structure of the optical system is the structure of once reflection, it will be hard to see an observing screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show an example of the structure of once reflection that the light is reflected on the boundary surface between a Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and prism <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, wherein <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> represents the actual optical path, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> represents by folding the optical system from the reflected surface so that it is easy to understand the optical path. It is known from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> that the reflected light returns to the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> again.

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In view of the above problems of the related art, an object of the present invention is to provide a optical imaging device to compensate for a variation in interference intensity, due to the variation in birefringence of the fiber in an optical probe, even if the optical probe is bent in a patient&apos;s body cavity. Further, the optical imaging device provides a physically small birefringence compensation means such that it can be included at the optical probe tip. Further, the device compensates for a variation in interference contrast, due to the variation in birefringence of the fiber, caused by every rotation of the bent and turned system. Further, the device makes the birefringence compensation means of the Faraday rotator function effectively. Further, the device provides a physically small composition of the distal optical member for the optical probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an optical imaging device to obtain an interference signal corrected so that scanning can be regarded as performed in the same direction, even if the scanning direction oscillates due to the swing of the swing mirror in the propagation delay time-varying means. Further, the optical imaging device prevents the corrected interference signal from deviating, even if slight hysteresis or deviation, during scanning to and fro, is caused by the hysteresis of temperature characteristics and dynamic characteristics, when the device uses a high-speed scanning mirror, such as a galvanometer mirror and a resonance scan mirror in particular. Further the device performs the above-mentioned correction automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide an optical imaging device to obtain an interference signal which is linear with respect to spatial distance from the probe tip, even if scanning the interference location is nonlinear with respect to time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide an optical imaging device to enable the demodulator to detect the envelope of the interference signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio, even if the Doppler frequency of the interference signal is varied by the variation in speed of scanning the interference location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide an optical imaging device to adjust the plane of polarization automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide an interference location scanning means which has a scanning range and scanning speed that are difficult to disturb from the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide an interference location scanning means which has the ability to perform high-speed scanning that is nearly linear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide an optical imaging device to measure length on the screen correctly, whatever the refractive index may be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide means for attenuating the reflection on the inner or outer surface of the outer sheath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to make the inner side of the outer sheath resistant against damage by the rotating optical element and to have a sheath with good optical quality in the region of the probe where signal light is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide an end optical system on the side of the signal light of OCT in which ghosts do not appear, the S/N ratio is good, and the ability to observe is excellent considering the problems as above mentioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide an optical scanning probe for advancing the S/N ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, another object of the present invention is to provide the optical scanning probe in which the observing depth degree is large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an object of the present invention is to provide the optical scanning probe with optics that are easy to assemble and manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, variations in interference intensity, due to the variation in birefringence of the fiber in the probe, are compensated for, by the provision of a polarization compensation means on an optical path, from the emission end of the single mode fiber in the optical probe to the subject. Further, a physically small polarization compensation means can be provided at the optical probe tip, because the Faraday rotator uses a magnetic garnet crystal. Further, almost all substantially parallel rays incident on the Faraday rotator will cause the plane of polarization to rotate by 45 degrees accurately, to produce high efficiency in polarization compensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the device has a first memory means for preserving an interference intensity signal that corresponds to a particular one-way swing based on the detection by the reference position detection means, and a second memory means for preserving an interference signal that corresponds to a swing in the opposite direction to the particular one-way swing. Backward reading of data stored in the first memory means and forward reading of data stored in the second memory means produces interference signals that indicate scanning in the same direction. Further, different delays are provided for first memory means and the second memory means so that data, stored in the first memory means and the second memory means, may be read at delayed points of time. Controlling the delays correct hysteresis and deviation caused by slight differences in the scanning directions to and fro. Further, a reference signal is detected in each interference signal, and the delay setting means is adjusted so that both reference signals coincide with each other at the position of the reference signal. It is possible, thereby to correct automatically hysteresis and deviation caused by the to and fro scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the use of a memory means for preserving interference intensity signals in time series, and a calculation means for calculating a memory address that corresponds to the interference location, to calculate the address, and to read data stored in the memory, produce an interference signal that corresponds to the interference location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the device uses a calculation means to calculate the Doppler frequency of an interference signal produced by scanning the interference location. Changing the frequency characteristics of the demodulator, according to the calculated Doppler frequency, can constantly set the demodulator, to produce a high signal-to-noise ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the device uses reference reflection means provided close to an end of the optical probe insertion unit, and obtains reflection data from the reference reflection means, in the form of an interference intensity signal produced from the interference means. Only setting a polarization adjustment means so that the interference contrast signal may be maximized, generally, is needed to adjust the plane of polarization for each probe automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the propagation delay time-varying means has a dispersive means, imaging means, and reflection mirror. The reflection mirror includes a polygon mirror. The rotation of the polygon mirror enables scanning the interference location. It is easy to stabilize the scanning range and scanning speed, because the polygon mirror scanning is nearly linear with respect to the time series, and because it is easy to stabilize rotation speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, when the reflection mirror is scanned by a resonant mechanical scanner, the scan becomes more linear by providing a specialized drive signal including one or more additional higher frequency harmonic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the optical imaging device comprises one or more scales that include a scale indicating an optical length in medium, or a scale indicating an optical length in the tissue, or a scale indicating optical length in the medium in those regions of the image representing the medium and which indicates optical length in the tissue in those regions of the image representing the tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Also, a rigid light permeability part made from an optical quality material such as glass or fused silica has no internal index of refraction boundaries, striations, or scatterers, and can be manufactured or polished in such as way as to provide a good optical surface on the inside and the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, as light that the number of times of reflection on the end surface of an optical element of an end optical system on the side of signal light of an optical tomography diagnosis device is less than three times does not return to a single mode fiber, it is possible to obtain the end optical system on the side of the signal light of the optical tomography diagnosis device that ghost does not appear and a S/N ratio is advanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Further, according to present invention, by matching agreeing the focal position in the peripheral direction of the cylindrical surface of a sheathe with the focal position in the longitudinal direction of the sheathe and by concentrating the focal point to a point in an observing beam outgone from the optical scanning probe, an optical scanning probe for advancing the S/N ratio is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Further, according to present invention, by making the beam spot diameter of an observing beam almost uniform over a long distance in the direction of the major axis of the observing beam, the optical scanning probe that observing depth degree is large is provided.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, by placing a rigid light permeability part on the optical window where an optical emitter and receiver are located, the optical characteristics of the outer sheath are not degraded even when the rotating support for the optical element at the tip end comes into contact with the interior of the outer sheath. Also, a rigid light permeability part made from an optical quality material such as glass or fused silica has no internal index of refraction boundaries, striations, or scatterers, and can be manufactured or polished in such a way as to provide a good optical surface on the inside and the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, as light does not return to a single mode fiber when the number of times of reflection of light on the end surface of an optical element of an end optical system on the side of signal light of an optical tomography diagnosis device is less than three times, it is possible to obtain the end optical system on the side of the signal light of the optical tomography diagnosis device so that ghosts do not appear and the S/N ratio is advanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, by matching the focal position in the peripheral direction of the cylindrical surface of a sheath with the focal position in the longitudinal direction of the sheath and by concentrating the focal point to a point in an observing beam outgone from the optical scanning probe, an optical scanning probe for advancing the S/N ratio is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Further, according to present invention, by making the beam spot diameter of an observing beam almost uniform over a long distance in the direction of the major axis of the observing beam, the optical scanning probe that observing depth degree is large is provided. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> &lt;First Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment is able to compensate for the stress-induced birefringence of the fiber bent and varied in quality so that it may be introduced into the patient&apos;s body cavity, and to compensate for the stress-induced birefringence of the fiber varied in quality, depending on the rotation of radial scanning in the patient&apos;s body cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a composition of an optical imaging device in the first embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an endoscope through which the first embodiment is passed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Optical imaging device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A (optical tomography imaging device), shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, includes superluminescent diode (SLD) or a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) based low coherence light source <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that emits amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). This low coherence light source <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a central wavelength of 1300 nm and an optical bandwidth of 50-70 nm, for example. It produces low coherence light that causes interference only when the optical path lengths of the interferometer are matched to within a short distance range, at an interfering distance of 17 microns, for example. In other words, this light may be divided into two rays, for example, and then mixed. In such cases, interfering light is detected if the difference between two optical lengths, from branch to junction, is within the short distance range of 17 microns or so; otherwise this light does not interfere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Light is emitted from low coherence light source <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and incident on an end of the first single mode fiber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and then sent to the other end surface (distal end surface). First single mode fiber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> leads to an optical coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is optically connected by the optical coupler, to a second single mode fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Thus, light is divided by optical coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, into two paths for transmission. On the distal side (distal of optical coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) of first single mode fiber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, optical rotary joint <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is interposed which couples a non-rotary part with a rotary part so that light can be sent to the probe. Connector <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is detachably connected to the distal end of a third single mode fiber <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in optical rotary joint <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and passed through optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Light is emitted from low coherence light source <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and sent (guided) to fourth single mode fiber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is rotated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The subject, biological tissue <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is scanned and irradiated with the light sent from the distal end of optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Light is scattered on the surface or inside of biological tissue <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and part of the reflection is collected which returns, through the reverse optical path, to first single mode fiber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Part of the returning light is sent by optical coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to the second single mode fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. From the end of second single mode fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, light is sent and incident on photodiode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for example, used as an optical detector. It should be noted that the rotor of optical rotary joint <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is driven by rotary drive <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, to rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> On the side distal of optical coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on second single mode fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided which varies the optical length of reference beam. Variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes, as explained below: a first optical length-varying means for quickly varying optical length only within a predetermined scanning range, depending on the optical length in which biological tissue <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is scanned by optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, in the depth direction only within the predetermined scanning range; a second optical length-varying means capable of varying optical length to compensate for the statistical variation of the optical scanning probe length so as to cancel the possible variations of each optical scanning probe length after optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is replaced with a new one; and a dispersion-varying means capable of varying dispersion to compensate for dispersion mismatch between the sample and reference arms of the interferometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is optically coupled, through facing collimator lens <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, to the distal end of second single mode fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. To grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and through facing lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, angular scanning mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is optically coupled which can rotate by a slight angle and is used as the first optical length-varying means. Mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is pivotally vibrated by galvanometer controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, quickly, as denoted by code b. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> reflects light. When applied to the galvanometer mirror, an AC drive signal pivotally vibrates the mirror in the movable part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In other words, the drive signal is applied by galvanometer controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the galvanometer mirror so that optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can scan biological tissue <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the depth direction only within the predetermined distance range at high speed.

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The optical length of light, which is sent from the end surface of second single mode fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is reflected by galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and which returns, is varied by such pivotal vibrations, only within the predetermined scanning range of distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In other words, galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> defines a first optical length-varying means used to obtain a tomogram in the depth direction. &ldquo;In vivo video rate optical coherence tomography&rdquo; (A. M. Rollins et al. supra) discloses this optical length-varying means based on galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The optical length-varying means disclosed in the reference is cited is actually a propagation group delay varying means. Despite the slight actual variation in optical length, variations in interference location, due to the group delay of low coherence light, are vast. The phrase &ldquo;variations in optical length&rdquo; used herein includes variations in interference location, due to the group delay. Another important advantage of this delay line is that it allows for compensation for uneven amounts of second-order optical dispersion in the two interferometer arms. This is important in the current embodiment because although the optical path lengths of the sample and reference arms are necessarily equal, the sample arm contains more of its path length in optical fiber than the reference arm does. If there were no compensation for the resulting difference in dispersion between the two arms, then the interference length (and hence the axial imaging resolution) would be greatly extended. As disclosed in the reference, dispersion compensation is accomplished by a slight adjustment in the distance between the grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the delay line. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, uniaxial stage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> defines second optical length-varying means which has a sufficient variable-optical length range to compensate for the statistical variation in the optical length of optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, after optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is replaced with a new one. Galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be used to vary optical length, in order to produce an image in the depth direction. In such cases, uniaxial stage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has the capability of an offset adjustment means for adjusting offset so that it can produce an image from a desired position (for example, the surface by the use of uniaxial stage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to vary optical length, in order to set the status so that interference may occur from the surface of biological tissue <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, even if the optical scanning probe tip does not reach biological tissue <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

Light is sent from fiber end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and incident on GRIN lens <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The incident light is then transmitted through Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, turned by prism <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, at right angles, and further transmitted by nylon tube <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, to produce observation beam <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>.

Interval tube <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is provided for unique positioning of the focus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> includes a single crystal of magnetic garnet which has the capability to rotate polarization by 45 degrees. When probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is introduced into the patient&apos;s body cavity, fourth single mode fiber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is bent by and adapted to the curvature of the endoscope. Rotation of flexible shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> causes the fourth single mode fiber to rotate and vary the bending directions periodically. Because of the stress and torsion acting on the fiber, fourth single mode fiber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> introduces birefringence. Interference contrast between light returning from optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> through optical coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and reflection from variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is damped if polarizations do not coincide with each other. Rotation of flexible shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> causes the interference signal amplitude to oscillate periodically to produce an observation image uneven in tone. With Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> provided at the distal end, whatever birefringence the single mode fiber may have, light is sent from fourth single mode fiber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, transmitted through Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, projected onto the biological tissue, reflected by the tissue, further transmitted through Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and returned to fourth single mode fiber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to produce a polarization that has rotated by 90 degrees to the incident polarization. The Faraday rotator has the capability to compensate for arbitrary birefringence of the fiber, because the polarization state of the light returning to the fiber coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will not vary depending on the birefringence of the fiber in the reference arm. This truth is disclosed in a reference &ldquo;Polarisation-insensitive fibre optic Michelson interferometer&rdquo; (Electr. Lett. Vol.27, pp518-519, 1991). A common Faraday rotator includes a garnet crystal and a magnet which provides a magnetic field for the crystal and which causes polarization to rotate by 45 degrees; whereas Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> includes a single crystal of magnetic garnet which acts as a magnet. Only a crystal is needed to form Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. It can be attached to the small optical scanning probe tip to be introduced into the patient&apos;s body cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Touching Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to the GRIN lens causes substantially parallel rays to be incident on Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In contrast to the arrangement of Faraday rotator between fiber end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and GRIN lens <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, such a touching arrangement ensures that the Faraday rotator can cause polarization to rotate by 45 degrees accurately. It is possible, therefore, to compensate for the birefringence, in accordance with the theory. In contrast to air, glass can decrease Fresnel reflection on the interface, when joined to the garnet crystal, because the garnet crystal has a very high refractive index. Such an arrangement will decrease irradiation light onto the biological tissue, and observation light returning from the biological tissue less than a pair of air-to-to-garnet interfaces would. Rotation of flexible shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> causes connection member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to rotate relative to sheath <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. There is risk of the connection member being damaged by contact with the inner side <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Since flexible shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> varies the overall length depending on the inserted shape of optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, observation beam <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may cross a scratch caused by contact of sheath inner side <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> with connection member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In such cases, the doctor may fail to observe the biological tissue. Rounded cap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, however, is connected to lens frame <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of lens unit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Although rounded part <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of cap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> sometimes touches the inner side <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, sheath inner side <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is difficult to damage, even when rounded cap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> rotates. Although depending on the sheath material, normally, gap <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of 8 mm or so is needed between rounded cap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and tip cap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, to produce a space for stretching due to the temperature rise of optical sheath <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> like nylon tube <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and for relative movement of sheath <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with flexible shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, due to the bending. Fluoroplastic like FEP can be used as material of sheath <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> shows the other structure of the probe tip. The differences from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> are reflection reduction coating <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> which is placed where the irradiation observation beam <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is emitted inside of the nylon tube (sheath) <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. A reflection reduction coating <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is also placed where the irradiation observation beam <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is emitted outside of the nylon tube (sheath) <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. By such placement of the reflection reduction coating <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, the Fresnel reflection caused by the refractive index difference between the nylon tube <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and air inside the tube is suppressed and thus the reduction of the emission light and detection light are avoided, and the inner reflection of the sheath surface is reduced. By placing the reflection reduction coating <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> thusly, the Fresnel reflection caused by the refractive index difference between the nylon tube <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and medium such as air or water outside the tube is suppressed and causes similar effects as the reflection reduction coating <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. The ghosts caused by multiple reflection between the reflecting surfaces are also avoided. </paragraph>

The tip cap <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> consists of glass or rigid plastic like polysulfone which is rigid and transparent to the observation light wavelength. The tip cap <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is connected to the non-transparent resin tube <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> placed instead of nylon tube <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by threads and adherent <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> As the tip cap <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> consists of rigid transparent material, even when connection member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or lens frame <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of lens unit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the interior of the tip cap <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, the observed images are not degraded by disturbing the observation beam <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by scratch on the tip cap <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. Also, the improved optical quality of the rigid transparent material ensures the quality of the diffraction-limited focussed light spot in the tissue and the re-coupling of image-bearing light back into the single mode fiber in the probe. The tip cap <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> can consist of glass pipe and closed end part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The same effects of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</cross-reference> can be obtained when a thin hard coating like thin glass pipe is used instead of the reflection reduction coating <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. It is only necessary for the glass pipe to be present where the light must traverse the sheath, and where the rotating prism may come into contact with the sheath. Especially when using a hard and flexible material such as thin ceramic coating, preferably polysilazane, an anti-wearable and flexible sheath can be realized. </paragraph>

Opening <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of rounded cap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> transmits observation beam <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and permits refractive index-matching water to permeate into the opening.

<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> &lt;Third Embodiment&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment is able to provide a high-resolution two-dimensional image, by high-speed scanning using optical length-varying means based on the delay line of mirror oscillation type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> Described below is a method of producing a radial image, by scanning of 1 line in the depth direction, and by the use of flexible shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to turn the distal end optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> shows relationships between depth direction scanning position curve <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> obtained by the movement of galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (either from the position encoder signal in the galvonometer, or from the galvanometer driver signal), mirror scanning timing signal <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> obtained by galvanometer controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, interference signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (the envelope of the interferogram signal) obtained by depth direction scanning, and line memory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> storing the interference signal. The abscissa indicates time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> To maximize scanning speed with galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it is effective to use the same waveform in scanning to and fro with the mirror, as denoted by curve <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In such cases, interference signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is divided into two substantially symmetrical waveforms with respect to mid point <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in the to-and-fro path: waveform <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and waveform <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In addition to waveform <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, waveform <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be used to produce a radial image. In such cases, it is possible to obtain double radial resolution. Interference signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is stored in line memory in time series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Data in line memory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is copied to two-dimensional frame memory <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>. Because of the nonlinear mirror scanning, as shown in waveform <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, we do not use that part of data stored in line memory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> which corresponds to the range from timing signal <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Only linear section of t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is copied to the first line in frame memory, with directions preserved at the first position a<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the last position b<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in memory. The nonlinear section of t<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>from position b<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to position c<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>where positions b<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and c<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>are symmetrical with respect to midpoint <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Linear section t<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, from c<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>where positions a<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>are symmetrical with respect to midpoint <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, is copied to the second line in frame memory <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>), with directions reversed at the first position cl and the last position d<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>due to scanning mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Thus, frame memory <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> can store interference signal <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which is produced by scanning in the same directions, and which is slightly different in radial position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> For the next timing signal <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>, the above procedure is followed. Repeating that procedure produces a two-dimensional image of interference signals. This image resembles that of interference signals obtained by scanning in the same directions, instead of the radial directions per cycle. With the probe side positioned at the center, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>C, this is converted into a circle, to produce a radial image. This method is named &ldquo;double sided scan.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows an algorithm for quickly converting a rectangular image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B, into a radial image as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</cross-reference>. As shown in the left-hand part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, two-dimensional image <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> has: the x direction which corresponds to the depth direction r; and the y direction which corresponds to rotation angle. In order to convert the x-y (Cartesian) coordinate system into the r-(polar) coordinate system <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> in the right-hand part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the following conversion F is used: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>sin ( )<highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>r,</italic></highlight>&thgr;)&equals;<highlight><italic>r </italic></highlight>cos(&thgr;) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>y</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>r</italic></highlight>,&thgr;)&equals;<highlight><italic>r </italic></highlight>sin(&thgr;) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> where (x(r, &thgr;), y(r, &thgr;)) represents the coordinate system shown in the right-hand part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In reality, since both image <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and image <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> are sets of pixels, a simple procedure for the use of this conversion equations to convert image <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> into image <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, however, produces an image that includes sparse pixels on or near the circumference. Inverse conversion F is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>r</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>x, y</italic></highlight>)&equals;{square root}(<highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;y</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>x, y</italic></highlight>)&equals;tan<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>y/x</italic></highlight>). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> A correspondence relationship is obtained by the use of the inverse conversion F. Since two or more pixels in image <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> correspond to one pixel in image <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, the use of such correspondence relationship can produce an image that does not lack pixels. The correspondence relationship is stored in a mapping array. The mapping array is a matrix the same size as the destination (e.g. polar) image, whose elements contain pointers to the memory locations of the corresponding pixel values in the stored rectangular image, according to the relationships expressed in the equations above. According to the pixel correspondence relationship stored in the array, even a low-processing power personal computer can convert image <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> into image <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, to produce real-time radial images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In reality, in the double sided scan method, galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and galvanometer controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have inferior temperature characteristics that cause symmetry to fluctuate with respect to scanning midpoint <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows such a state. Displaying a radial image in this state, unfortunately, produces overlapped borders, and extremely low-quality images. Waveform <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is stored in frame memory <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, waveform <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and waveform <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are out of phase by timet in the time At direction. Peaks denoted by <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are caused by reflection on the surface of probe sheath <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Such reflections have much higher signal intensity than scattering by the biological tissue. Signals that exceed a predetermined threshold are regarded as reflection on the surface of probe sheath <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. It is possible to eliminate out-of-phase waveforms in the time direction, and to prevent picture quality from becoming inferior, by detecting peaks <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and varying time interval t<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference> so that they may coincide with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Phase adjustment knob <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is provided on optical system adjustment panel <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>. The position of the knob is detected by the use of a potentiometer (not shown) connected to phase adjustment knob <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. While observing the actual image, the doctor can eliminate phase deviation by manually turning phase adjustment knob <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, in order to change the interval time t<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, according to the knob position. On optical system adjustment panel <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight>, manual/auto selector switch <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is provided to select manual adjustment with the phase adjustment knob, or automatic adjustment using reflection on the surface of probe sheath <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> illustrates another method of collecting double-sided scan data and converting the data to a radial image display using a mapping array instead of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>. The data recording device records to frame memory all of the data collected during time t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and t<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to a single line. The mapping array, in addition to converting the data from rectangular to polar format, maps data collected during time t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to one radial image line, and data collected during time t<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to the adjacent radial image line in a reverse manner. Thus, both forward and reverse line data are mapped successfully to the radial display, and the data collected during time t<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is not used in the radial display because the mapping array does not point to this data. This method eliminates the need to write line data to frame memory in a forward and reverse manner. The mapping array reverses the data with no on-line computation. The only drawback to this method is the small additional amount of frame memory required to store the unusable data collected during time t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Phase adjustment can be performed similarly as the above method, by providing means to adjust the duration of time t<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and/or time t<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> In addition to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, another method uses resonant scan mirror instead of galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, to further accelerate scanning with the mirror. In such cases, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the mirror is swung at resonance frequency in the form of a sine wave; therefore, scanning depth also varies in the sine-wave manner. In such cases, interference signals are used in sections e<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through e<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, included in relatively nearly linear range. Sections e<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through e<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>have the same intervals; whereas they differ in scanning depth, as denoted by e<highlight><subscript>1&prime;</subscript></highlight> through e<highlight><subscript>4&prime;</subscript></highlight>. To produce an image, it is necessary to convert data on sections e<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>through e<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>stored in line memory <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, into linear data in the depth direction. The mapping array can also include the calculation to thus de-warp the image according to the following relation: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The speed of moving the mirror is the Doppler frequency of optical heterodyne detection, which is proportional to the time derivative of the depth position as shown in curve <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. During sections e<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through e<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, Doppler frequency varies &Dgr;f <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a composition of demodulator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Demodulator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> includes: a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> which includes high-pass filter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, and low-pass filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>; and a demodulating logarithmic amplifier <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> having envelope-detection capability; and a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Band-pass filter <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> extracts only components modulated by Doppler frequency of optical heterodyne detection. The demodulating logarithmic amplifier <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> performs envelope-detection and logarithm amplification, in order to convert biological-tissue scattering signals having a wide dynamic range, into display signals having a narrower dynamic range suitable for analog-to-digital conversion. Low-pass filter <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> removes higher-order modulation signals and broadband electrical noise, to produce envelope signals that include scattering information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, if the Doppler frequency varies &Dgr;f <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, it is necessary to widen the pass band of band-pass filter <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. In such cases, the filter transmits additional noise components to reduce signal-to-noise ratio. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, scanning speed is detected in a real-time manner. Doppler frequency f <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is calculated and added to frequency f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of low-pass filter <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> multiplied by coefficient k to produce the cut-off value <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of high-pass filter <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>; whereas the difference between Doppler frequency f <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> multiplied by k is cut-off value <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of low-pass filter <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Both cut-off values <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are inputted, and used in a real-time manner. Alternatively, a single band-pass filter with a tunable center frequency and an appropriate bandwidth is used. The detected or calculated Doppler frequency is used directly, or by converting to a proportional voltage using a frequency-to-voltage converter, to tune the center frequency of the band-pass filter in real time. It is possible, thus, to minimize the inferior signal-to-noise ratio, due to the variation in Doppler frequency f. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the demodulator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which preserves high signal to noise ratio even in the event of nonlinear reference arm scanning is the coherent tracking demodulator illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, The input signal from the amplifier is first band-pass filtered using cascaded high-pass filter <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and low-pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> set to pass the entire frequency content of the desired portion of the nonlinearly modulated interferometric signal, Df. The band-passed signal then serves as the input to two mixers <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. A reference signal generator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> produces a frequency-modulated reference signal whose frequency is proportional at every instant to the derivative of the position of the reference delay scanner, which is calculated to be equal to the instantaneous Doppler shift of the reference arm light. This signal is mixed with the band-passed interferometric signal in mixer <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> to generate the in-phase component I of the demodulated signal. A second copy of the reference signal is delayed by 90 degrees in a phase shifter <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and mixed with the band-passed interferometric signal in mixer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to generate the quadrature component Q of the demodulated signals. Both I and Q components are then filtered in low-pass filter <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and high-pass filter <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and combined into a single magnitude signal in power combiner <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. The output <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is digitized in the analog-to-digital converter. Alternatively, the magnitude calculation may take place after separate digitization of the I and Q components in the computer. This tracking generator has the advantage of automatically following nonlinearities in the reference arm Doppler shift without requiring rapid adjustment of filter parameters. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> The forth embodiment is able to damp out undesired DC components of the detected light signal from internal probe reflections, to intensify interference optical signals, and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the detection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows the fourth embodiment. Described below are differences between the first embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and the fourth embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Optical circulator <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is provided along the path of the first single mode fiber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (SMF) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. SMF is divided into two: division <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> and division <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Optical circulator <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> has three ports connected to SMF <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, SMF <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, and SMF <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. One end of attenuator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is connected to the end of second single mode fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The other end of attenuator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and SMF <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> are connected to differential detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Optical circulator <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> can transmit light, with low damping, only in two directions from SMF <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> to SMF <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, and from SMF <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to SMF <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. The optical circulator cuts off light transmission in other directions. Observation light is emitted from low coherence light source <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, through SMF <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, through SMF <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, and through coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, to a subject side where optical scanning probe <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> exists, and on the reference side to variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. At coupler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, reflection from the subject combines with reflections from the reference. Interference light, with the opposite phase, is transmitted to SMF <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and SMF <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and slightly damped by optical circulator <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, and then is transmitted to SMF <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight>. Attenuator <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is adjusted so that intensity from SMF <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> may have the same steady component as intensity from SMF <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. They are thus inputted to differential detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> amplifies the difference between optical amplitude for SMF <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> and optical amplitude for SMF <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and sends an output to demodulator <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. SMF <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> interference light has the opposite phase to that of SMF <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> interference light. Since in the optical system, steady light and internal reflections, other than interference light, have the same phase, calculating the difference damps steady light components greatly; whereas interference light doubles approximately. Also, common mode noise, such as excess source intensity noise, is mostly rejected. In interference signal detection, it is possible, thus, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio maximum by 20 dB or so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Double-pass mirror <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is provided on the optical path in variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, light is sent from second first single mode fiber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, through lens <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, through grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, through lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, through galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, through lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, through grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and through <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and returned to the fiber end. Double-pass mirror <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> so that light may be passed through grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and through galvanometer mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> four times. The optimal placement of the double-pass mirror is either directly underneath or else above the light path from collimator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, i.e., out of the plane of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The principle of double-pass scanning is described in detailed in &ldquo;In vivo video rate optical coherence tomography&rdquo; (A. M. Rollins et al. supra). It is advantageous to double-pass scanning in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> so that substantially constant intensity can be obtained, and so that interference light amplitude is stable despite the rotation angle. Since light is passed through the optical path four times, it is advantageous to double-pass scanning that even variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the same composition can provide longer variations in optical length. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Light is sent to SMF <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, and incident on transmission delay line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> that corresponds to variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Light is sent from the end part of SMF <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, converted by collimator lens <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> into parallel rays. Parallel rays are transmitted through beam splitter <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, and incident on grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As in variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the incident light is transmitted through lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and reflected by mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and sent through lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and returned to grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Returned light is reflected by beam splitter <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> toward collimator lens <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and condensed onto the end part of SMF <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. Transmission delay line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> can vary optical lengths of SMF <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and SMF <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the same principle as variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Rays are sent from SMF <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and from SMF <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. In optical coupler <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, the rays interfere with each other. Interference light is obtained by optical coupler <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, and detected by detector <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, to produce the high signal-to-noise ratio, as described above relative to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> A more efficient version of the transmissive delay line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. Light is sent to and SMF <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> and is incident on transmission delay line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> which corresponds to variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>.

Parallel rays are incident on grating <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. As in double-pass variable-optical length mechanism <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the incident light is transmitted through lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and reflected by mirror <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and sent back through lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and returned to a double-pass mirror <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>.

Rotation is expressed as &thgr;&equals;&ohgr;&times;t, where &ohgr; represents angular velocity, and t represents time. The changing rate of the difference in optical length per unit of time is: dq/dt and is proportional to the doppler frequency of the optical heterodyne signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Since the polygonal mirror rotates in a constant direction, depth direction scanning is not performed not alternately both in the positive and negative directions as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>. While the polygon rotates, whenever a new surface faces lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, scanning in the same direction is performed. In contrast to signal processing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>A, and to the to-and-fro scanning in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, polygonal mirror in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> eliminates the necessity of phase adjustment. Because of the independence of phase deviation due to the temperature characteristics, it is possible to determine scanning position accurately. To adjust Doppler frequency by means of mirror rotation, and to produce a great variation in optical length, it is possible to make the center <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the polygonal mirror deviate from optical axis <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> A specially designed drive signal may be used to linearize the scan effected by a resonant scanner. The ideal drive signal consists of a uniform triangular wave, representing a constant scan rate in one direction for exactly half of the waveform period, followed immediately by a constant scan rate in the opposite direction for the remaining half of the waveform period. A resonant scanner is driven by a sinusoidal drive signal, which can be interpreted as the first harmonic of the Fourier decomposition of the ideal drive signal. In order to effect a scan which is more linear, one or more additional harmonic components of the ideal drive signal can be superposed with the first harmonic component. The mechanical response of the scanner will attenuate higher frequency harmonic components, so more than one or two may not be possible. The higher frequency harmonic components can be amplified appropriately in order to compensate for their attenuation by the mechanical response of the scanner. </paragraph>

These embodiments are related to the end optical system on the side of the signal light of the optical tomography diagnosis device that ghosts do not appear and an S/N ratio is advanced.

<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the end surface of each of the optical elements is not perpendicular to a flux of incident signal light. Since the number of times of reflection of that light between end surfaces of each of optical elements in an end optical system on the side of the signal light is less than three, that light does not return to the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the end surfaces of all the optical elements of the end optical system on the side of the signal light, that is to say, the end surfaces of the single mode fiber, both ends of the refractive index distribution lens, both ends of the Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, the end surfaces on the incident and the outgoing side of prism <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> are slantedly polished to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> These points as above mentioned are now described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</cross-reference> show optical paths when light from the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> is reflected by a third surface once as an example. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34C and 34D</cross-reference> show optical paths when light from the single mode fiber is reflected by a seventh surface once as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34C</cross-reference> show the order in which the reflection of light occurs within the respective optical systems after the light is emitted from the respective single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34D</cross-reference> are schematic views of the respective optical systems folded back relative to the respective reflected planes (S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) in an axially symmetrical manner in order to help understand the respective paths of reflected light. When a surface from which light is reflected is planar as in the present embodiments, it is enabled to follow the path of reflected light by folding back an optical system relative to the light reflected surface plane in an axially symmetrical manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> In these embodiments, the right and left optical systems with the reflected plane interposed therebetween shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34D</cross-reference> respectively do not level off with each other. This is because S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (the boundary surface between the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> and the refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>) and S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (the outer surface of sheath <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>) have been polished to be slanted. It should be noted that in each figure, light is emitted from the single mode fiber depicted on the left side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> The light emitted from the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> advances to the position Pi<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is on the surface side of the single mode fiber of the refractive index distribution lens. Light emitted from a single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> disperses at an angle smaller than a predetermined angle. In each of these embodiments, since there is refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> provided next to single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>, the light emitted from the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> advances to reflected plane S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (or S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) while gradually gathering within the refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. In each embodiment, the light impinged on reflected plane S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (or S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) bounces back in a direction different from that in which the light has traveled because the reflected plane S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (or S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) has been polished to be slanted relative to the light. (Note that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>D, the light is depicted in a manner to pass through the reflected plane.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>B, when light arrives at a surface of reflection coplanar with the end face of the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>, the light is off center located away from) the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> and exits at position Po<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this way, the light impinging on reflected plane S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and undergoing one reflection will not bounce back into the single mode fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>C and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>D, the light bounced back by reflected surface S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> impinges on a side of Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> (position Po<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and shielded. Therefore, the light reflected from S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will not return to single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> According to the structure of the present invention, it is possible not to return the light reflected once to the single mode fiber. According to the present invention, it is possible that the light from the single mode fiber is eclipsed after reflecting by the end surface of the optical element and is returned to a place shifted from the single mode fiber by making a flux of the signal light through the end surface of the optical element not be perpendicular to the end surface, as a result, a S/N ratio is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the present invention, the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens of the optical end system on the side of the signal light agrees with the optical axis of the single mode fiber, and all the end surfaces on the side of an object of single mode fibers as above mentioned and of the optical element in the optical end system on the side of the signal light are slantedly polished in the same direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> This point will be described by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A, 35B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A, 35B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C, and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>D, the light emitted from single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> passes through S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, advances within refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, and arrives at S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The light arriving at S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is reflected back and arrives at S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The position of the light reflected back to S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is located at the position Po<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is away from the center (optical axis of refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>) because S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has been polished to have a slanted surface relative to the light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> The light bounced back by S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> again advances toward S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In the configuration of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</cross-reference> in which S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have been arranged so that their slanted surfaces orient in the same direction, the light immediately after being reflected from S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> advances at a large angle relative to the optical axis of refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. While returning through refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> toward S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, therefore, the light impinges on a side of the lens (position Po<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) and shielded. In this way, the reflected light will not return to the single mode fiber. In contrast, in the configuration as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>C and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>D, which is not according to the present invention, the light immediately after being reflected from S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> advances in substantially parallel with the optical axis of refractive index profile lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. Thus the light travels along the optical axis of refractive index profile lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and arrives at S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> again. The light is then reflected from S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> once again and arrives at the position Po<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> on the surface of the side of the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> of the refractive index distribution lens and ultimately returns to the single mode fiber. Therefore, a ghost image appears in the configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is understood that there is an effect that does not return the reflected light that the number of times of reflection is less than three times on the end surface of the optical element to the single mode fiber by polishing slantedly all the end surfaces on the side of the object of the single mode fiber and all the end surfaces of the refractive index distribution lens in the same direction to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Further, in the end optical system on the side of the signal light of the light tomography diagnosis device according to the present invention, the most exterior side of the end optical system on the side of the signal light includes a sheath, a flux of the signal light is slantedly incident on the sheath, the incident angle to the normal line of the sheath of the main light of the signal light incident on the sheath is larger than 10 to prevent the light reflected three times in the sheath from returning to the single mode fiber. Here, the chief light ray of the signal light incident on the sheath means the trace of the light which has proceeded on the optical axis inside of the single mode fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> A method for making the incident angle to the normal line of the sheath of the main light of the signal light larger than 10&deg; is to set the angle of the normal line of the surface <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>C of the prism <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> that is the optical element for deflecting the observing direction to 48.5&deg;. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> The light emitted from single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> passes through refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and prism <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>, then arrives at outer surface S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The light arriving at S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is reflected and impinges on inner surface S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight>. The light reflected from S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> bounces back to outer surface S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of sheath <highlight><bold>247</bold></highlight> again. The light reflected from the surface once again now advances toward single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. At this time, conditions are set as follows. End face <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>C of prism <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> has been made to have an angle of more than 45 degrees, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</cross-reference>. The angle of incidence on the sheath has been set to be more than 10 degrees. Then, the light undergoing three internal reflections in the sheath, which ultimately advances toward the single mode fiber, is dislocated in a large amount from the light that is incident on the sheath the first time (this light advances outward).

As a result, the light reflected from S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> the second time will not return to the single mode fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> In contrast, end face <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>C of prism <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> has been made to have an angle of nearly 45 degrees shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> According the present embodiment, the end surface of each of the optical elements is not perpendicular to a flux of an incident signal light so that when the number of times of light reflection between end surfaces of each of the optical elements in an end optical system on the side of the signal light is less than three light does not return to the single mode fibers. Substantially, the end surfaces of all the optical elements of the end optical system on the side of the signal light, that is to say, the single mode fibers, both ends of the refractive index distribution lens, both ends of the Faraday rotator, the end surfaces on the incident and the outgoing side of prism are slantedly polished to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> As above mentioned, by slanting the end surface of each optical element to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens, it is possible that the light reflected once does not return to the single mode fiber and the S/N ratio is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Further, in the end optical system on the side of the signal light of the optical tomography diagnosis device, the end surfaces on the side of the object of the single mode fiber and the end surfaces of the refractive index distribution lens are wholly slantedly polished in the same direction. Furthermore, the present embodiment is constructed to satisfy the following conditions 1 and 2 on all the planes of each optical element. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> However, NA represents NA of light radiated into air in case of polishing perpendicularly an end surface of a single mode fiber, </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> &thgr;<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>is the angle of the normal line of an end surface on the side of the object of the single mode fiber to the optical axis of the single mode fiber, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> &thgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>is the angle of the normal line of the end surface s of the optical element of the end optical system on the side of the signal light to the optical axis of refractive index distribution lens as above mentioned, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> m is the number of border surfaces of the end optical system on the side of the signal light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> Condition 1 is the condition for preventing the reflected light from the end surface on the side of the object of the single mode fibers from returning to the place where the reflected light is composed. As the light reflected by the end surface on a side object of the single mode fiber to the optical axis of the single mode fiber at a large angle when the angle of the end surface of the single mode fiber satisfies condition 1, the light is not totally reflected between the core of the single mode fiber and a clad. Therefore, the reflected light is sufficiently attenuated until it reaches a coupler and the S/N ratio is not aggravated. On one hand, as the light reflected by the boundary surface between the single mode fiber and air returns to the optical axis of the fiber at a small angle when the angle of the end surface of the single mode fiber does not satisfy the condition 1, total reflection repeats in the single mode fibers, the reflected light reaches the coupler for composing the reference light and the signal light. Therefore, the S/N ratio is aggravated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> Condition 2 is the condition for preventing the light reflected less than three times from returning to the single mode fiber. As the reflected light flies to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens at the large angle when the angle of the end surface of the optical element satisfies (Condition 2), the light is eclipsed on the side surface and is easy to come off from the effective diameter of the single mode fiber. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, an air layer is provided between single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> and refractive index profile lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>. This produces a path of light that is emitted from the slanted end of the single mode fiber, impinged on and reflected back from end surface S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, which is located on the single mode fiber side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> If the angle of slanted surface S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (on the single mode fiber side of refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>) meets condition 2 as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>A, the light impinged on S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is reflected to positions away from the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> (the light arrives at the position Po<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</cross-reference>) despite the fact that it disperses outwardly . As a result, the light reflected once from S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> does not bounce back into the single mode fiber. An optical system with a good signal-to-noise ratio is thus configured. If the angle of slanted surface S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (on the single mode fiber side of refractive index distribution lens <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>) does not meet condition 2 as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>B, part of the light reflected from S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to disperse outwardly returns to the single mode fiber (the light arrives at the position Po<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</cross-reference>). Thus the light reflected once from S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> bounces back to the single mode fiber, resulting in a worse signal-to-noise ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> To prevent light undergoing three reflections from returning to the single mode fiber, the optical devices should be arranged in such a manner (not shown) that their slanted end faces are oriented in the same direction because of the reason similar to that in the first embodiment. In addition, each end face should be polished so that the angle of slant becomes more than theta f. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> As known from the example as above mentioned, it is possible not to return the light reflected on the end surface to the single mode fibers by satisfying the conditions 1 and 2 about the angles of the single mode fibers and the end surface on the side of the object. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> According to the present embodiment, the end surface of each of the optical elements is not perpendicular to a flux of an incident signal light so that when the number of times of light reflection between the end surfaces of each of optical elements in an end optical system on the side of the signal light is less than three times, light does not return to the single mode fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the reflected light from the end surface of the optical element of the end optical system does not return the single mode fiber by decentering the optical axis of the single mode fiber to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens that is the optical element with a light gathering effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> When shifting the optical axes of the refractive index distribution lens and the single mode fiber, the flux of the light from the single mode fiber, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, passes through the place shifted from the optical axis on the side of the fiber of the refractive index distribution lens. The light incident on the place shifted from the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens is bent in the refractive index distribution lens, including the side of the object of the refractive index distribution lens, strikes slantedly on the Faraday rotator on the side of the object and the end surface of the prism, and it is possible to prevent the light reflected less than three times on each end surface from returning to the single mode fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> As the flux of the signal light is slanted to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens on the end surface on the side of the object of the refractive index distribution lens and the end surface of the optical element on the side of the object nearer it than it when decentering of the optical axis of the single mode fiber to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens, it is possible to prevent the reflected light from returning to the single mode fiber even if the end surface on the side of the object of the refractive index distribution lens and the end surface of the optical element on the side of the object nearer it are perpendicular to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> Further, when decentering the optical axis of the single mode fiber to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens, it is possible to make the flux of the signal light incident on the sheath slantedly even if using the prism that decenters the observing direction by a normal 90&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> According to the present embodiment, by decentering the optical axis of the single mode fiber to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens by &minus;0.24, even if using a normal prism with the angle to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens of the normal line of the sloping surface of the prism at 45&deg;, it is possible to make the incident angle of the chief light ray of the signal light to the sheath 11.8&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> On one hand, when the end surface on the side of the single mode fiber of the refractive index distribution lens and the end surface of optical element between the single mode fiber and the refractive index distribution lens are perpendicular to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens, there is the case that signal light strikes perpendicularly on the end surface of the optical element and the reflected light returns to the single mode fiber. In order to avoid this problem, set the angle of the end surface of each optical element to satisfy the following conditions 1 and 3. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> However, NA represents NA of light radiated into air in case of polishing perpendicularly the end surface of the single mode fiber, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> n is the refractive index of the core of the single mode fiber, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> f is the angle of the normal line of the end surface on the side of the object of the single mode fiber to the optical axis of the single mode fiber, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> g are angles of the normal line of the end surface on the side of the single mode fiber of the refractive index distribution lens and the normal lines of the end surfaces of all the optical elements between the single mode fiber and the refractive index distribution lens to the optical axis of the refractive index distribution lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Condition 1 is the condition for preventing the reflected light from the end surface on the side of the object of the single mode fiber from returning to the place where the reflected light is composed with the reference light, similarly to Embodiment 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> Condition 3 is the condition for shifting the light reflected from the end surface on the side of the single mode fiber of the refractive index distribution lens and from the optical element on the side of the single mode rather than the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> Then, it is preferable that the refractive index distribution lens, according to the present embodiment, is positioned adjacent to the single mode fiber by holding an air layer to or is directly cemented to the single mode fiber. By the arrangement as above mentioned, it is not necessary to polish slantedly the end surface except the single mode fiber and the side of the single mode fiber of the refractive index distribution lens, and it is easy to process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> According to embodiments 7 to 9, it is possible to provide an end optical system on the side of signal light of OCT that there is no ghost, the S/N ratio is good, and ability to observe is excellent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0343" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0343&rsqb;</number> Next, an object of the tenth and eleventh embodiments is to assemble extremely precisely an optical scanning probe into which an optical system as shown in the seventh, eighth and ninth embodiments is integrated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0345" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0345&rsqb;</number> A tenth embodiment of the present invention will be described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42, 43A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B. The structure of the end part of an optical scanning probe is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42, 43A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0346" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0346&rsqb;</number> The end part <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of an optical sheathe includes a flexible Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and an end cap <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> for closing the opening of the end, and the Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is adhered to the end cap <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. The Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> has light transmission at least on the side of the end. A lens unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is constructed by adhering a prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, a Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and a GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> from the side of the end in order respectively. The prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is designed so that an observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> outgoing from the prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> has an outgoing angle on the side of the end of the probe to the perpendicular of the cylindrical surface of the Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The angle is set about 12 through 13. The distal end of a single mode fiber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is fixed to a ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> by adhesive <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is constructed by making a radius small by shaving an outer peripheral surface on the side of a rear end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0347" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0347&rsqb;</number> The lens unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is fixed by adhering to the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> in a hollow housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and the end surface on the side of the end of the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is adhered to the end surface on the side of the rear end of GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. Further, the end part of a flexible shaft <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is inserted into the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and at the same time, is connected and fixed by adhesion by inserting a shaved part with a step <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> of the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> into the inner cavity <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0348" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0348&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A, a</cross-reference> protective frame <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is installed so that the lens unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is held by both sides of the protective frame <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> on the side of the end of the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Further, a round cap <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is adhered on the side of the end of the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The round cap <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> includes an opening part <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> so that it is possible to transmit the observing beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> The surfaces of both ends of GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> are slantly polished and the surfaces of both ends are parallel to each other. The end of the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is slantly polished at the same angle of the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, too. Therefore, the contact surfaces between the prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and the Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, between the Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and between the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> are in parallel to each other, and the perpendicular of the contact surface is at a fixed angle to an optical axis O. The angle is set to about 6&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> The vertices on the side of the acute angle of the end surface on the side of the rear end of the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and on the side of the obtuse of the end surface of the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> are each shown by a marking <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. Further, the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is provided with a recognizing hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> near the contact part between the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> Next, the action of tenth embodiment will be explained. Light which is guided into a single mode fiber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> leaves from the end surface of a ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is incident on GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, transmitted through a Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, changed in direction by a prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, becomes an observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> transmitting through a sheath <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and is collected to a focus <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. It is possible to change a focal position <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> by changing the longitudinal length of the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> As each contact surface between the prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>, GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> has a fixed angle to the direction perpendicular to the optical axis respectively, the optical axes of reflected light and multiple reflected light which comes out on each contact surface is shifted from the optical axis O and does not return to the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> As an observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> has the outgoing angle &thgr; to the perpendicular of the cylindrical surface of the Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, reflected light and multi reflected light occurred on an outer surface does not return to the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Further, when practically observing the tissue of a living body with OCT during an endoscopy procedure, the tissue of the living body is often observed with the probe tip at an angle to the lumen of the tract under examination rather than parallel to it. Therefore, there are advantages that as the outgoing angle &thgr; of the observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> is directed at an angle to the axis of the probe, the observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> is possible to be almost perpendicularly incident on the tissue of the living body and it is possible to obtain a more accurate OCT image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>B, upon noting recognizing the markings <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> from the recognizing hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> when adhering the contact surface between the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, it will be possible to adjust the phases of the slantly polished surfaces of the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. At the same time, it is possible to remove adhesive forced out from the recognizing hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> Further, as the lens unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is integrally contacted with the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> through the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, it is possible to agree easily and surely with the optical axis O. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>A, as the lens unit <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is protected by the protective frame <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> installed on the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, it is possible to reduce the danger of damaging the lens unit <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> when assembling, such as adhering the round cap <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Further, at the same time, it is possible to secure a tab for sticking of the round cap <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> by the protective frame <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> According to the tenth embodiment, as light reflected by an optical element is not returned to an optical fiber, the ratio S/N of a system is advanced. Further, it is possible to assemble in relation to correct positions and phases and to secure performance according to an optical design. Further, it is possible to advance assembling and productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> &lt;Embodiment 11&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> An eleventh embodiment according to the present invention is described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 through 45</cross-reference>B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of an optical scanning probe in that each optical element is slantly contacted. And <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A and 45B</cross-reference> show cross-sections as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Though the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> is fundamentally the same as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>, there are differences at the points as follows. First, a mirror <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> adhered to a round cap <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is installed instead of a prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and an outgoing angle to the perpendicular of the cylindrical surface of the Teflon tube of an observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> outgoing from the mirror is directed in the side of the rear end. Next, though the perpendicular of both surfaces slantly polished of a GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> is at an angle to an optical axis O, they are polished at different angles respectively. Therefore the contact surface between a Faraday rotator <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and a ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> has a different angle. Further, instead of providing the marking <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and a recognizing hole <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, the D cut <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45A</cross-reference> is provided on the cylindrical surface of the vertex on the side of an obtuse of the surface slantly polished on the side of the rear end of the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>. D cut <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45B</cross-reference> is provided on the cylindrical surface of the vertex on the side of an acute angle of the surface slantly polished on the side of the point end of the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> respectively, and the D cut <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is also provided at the position respectively corresponding to the inner cavity of a housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> Next, the action of the eleventh embodiment will be explained. Though fundamentally same as the tenth embodiment, there are differences at the following points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> As the perpendicular of each contact surface is at an angle to an optical axis O, even if the polishing angle of the end surface of each optical element is different as the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>, similarly to the tenth embodiment, the action is not different in that the reflected light and the multi reflected light on each contact surface does not directly return to a single mode fiber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> When adhering a round cap <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to a housing <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, it is possible to change a focal position <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> by changing an inserted interval <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>. Though the outgoing angle &thgr; of an observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> is directed on the side of the rear end, action is the same as in embodiment 10 in that the reflected light and the multi reflected light occur on an inner and an outer surface of a Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> does not directly return to the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> As the phase of each contact surface slantly polished is matched by the D cut <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> in inserting when adhering the end surface of the GRIN lens <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> to the end surface of the ferrule <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> in a housing <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, it is possible to surely contact both surfaces only by inserting each element by adjusting to the D cut <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> According to the eleventh embodiment, in addition to the same effects as those of the tenth embodiment, it is possible to adjust a focal position when assembling. Further, setting of the phases of slantly polished surfaces is easy compared to the tenth embodiment and assembling is advanced. </paragraph>

On the light exiting surface of the prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, a cylindrical lens part <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> is provided with a cylindrical convex surface <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> so that the peripheral direction of a probe is a curved surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> The structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A and 47B</cross-reference> is the same as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A and 46B</cross-reference> except that the curvature of the cylindrical convex surface <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is large. The structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A and 48B</cross-reference> is the same as that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A and 46B</cross-reference> except that the cylindrical convex surface <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is provided in the longitudinal direction. The cylindrical lens part <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>A through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</cross-reference> may be provided by polishing the prism <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> or by adhering a cylindrical convex lens to the prism. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> Here, for descriptive purpose, it is defined that the peripheral direction of the cylindrical surface of the Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is the X axis and the direction of the major axis of the cylindrical surface of the Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is the Y axis. Though the curved surface of the Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> has a concave lens effect in the direction of the X axis of the observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>, if it is designed that a cylindrical convex surface <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> cancels the effect, it will be possible to make the focal position <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the X-axis of the observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> agree with the focal position <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the Y-axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> As in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A and 47B</cross-reference>, the curvature of the cylindrical convex surface is larger than that of the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A and 46B</cross-reference>, power of the convex lens effect of the cylindrical convex surface <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is stronger than that of the concave lens effect of the Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and it is possible to make positively the focal position <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the Y axis shorter than the focal position <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the X axis of the observing beam <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> As in the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A and 48B</cross-reference>, since the focal position <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the X axis is moved away by the concave lens effect of the Teflon tube <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the focal position <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the Y axis is moved closer by the cylindrical convex surface <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, it is possible to more positively separate the distance between focal positions <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> According to the twelfth embodiment, the S/N ratio is advanced by concentrating the energy density of an observing beam. Further, observing depth is advanced by dispersing the energy density of the observing beam. </paragraph>
