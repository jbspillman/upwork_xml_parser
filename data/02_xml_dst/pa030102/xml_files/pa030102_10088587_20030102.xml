<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Smoking cigarettes has been known to be a major cause of diseases such as a lung cancer, bronchitis, and coronary or peripheral artery disease. Individual chemical substances contained in cigarettes have already been recognized as a carcinogen, and passive smoking has been elucidated to have carcinogenicity recently, so that smokeless chewing tobacco and snuff are also listed in carcinogenic substance list in the United States. Among the components contained in cigarettes, nicotine, which is a colorless volatile liquid alkaloid, has high toxicity of irritating and paralyzing the nerve tissue such as cerebral nerve, cerebellum and spinal cord while having calming effect, excitement effect and pleasure-giving effect. Therefore, there have been continuously reported that nicotine relating to the incidences of lung cancer, pharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer and gastric cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Nicotine also has mental dependence, so that a continual intake of nicotine by smoking or the like may cause nicotine dependence. For example, when a heavy smoker quits smoking, withdrawal symptoms are seen in a short time period and craving for smoking increases. If the smoker cannot tolerate his craving for smoking, and takes more nicotine to avoid the symptoms and torment, his health is staked at a higher risk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In those times, campaigns for nonsmoking and moderation in smoking have been run worldwide, and a smoking population tends to be decreased every year. There is a trend toward restriction in smoking in public facilities and public transportation, so that a smoker frequently faces a situation in which he is forced to stop smoking. However, mental and physical torments may be caused by breaking a smoking habit in many cases, and a sudden drop in an intake of nicotine may cause serious withdrawal symptoms. For this reason, there is an earnest need for a method showing an effect on prohibiting or moderating smoking gradually without causing any problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As such methods, a food or a medicament such as nicotine gum, and candy, drop or gum, containing various plant extracts, an inorganic substance and the like has been so far known (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 4-46119, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 61-63243, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 62-296840, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 62-296840, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 8-308544, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 82-42582, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 7-18076, and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 48-85722). Moreover, a method of causing discomfort by inhaling a certain chemical substance simultaneously with cigarette smoke using a pipe or the like, and a method of promoting anti-smoking by absorbing nicotine into body using a nicotine pad or nicotine nasal spray have been used. The principles for prohibiting or moderating smoking by these means are classified into three categories: (1) suppression for craving for smoking by paralyzing gustation and the like; (2) promotion of a detoxification/excretion of nicotine in the body; and (3) supply of nicotine by a cigarette substitute. However, in a case where nicotine is absorbed transdermally or the like, nicotine exists internally after all, so that this method cannot be said to be good for health. Further, even when a reduction in the craving for smoking is achieved, there would be a risk for dependence on the cigarette substitute used. The above-mentioned food or the like has a little effect, and would not satisfactorily gratify smokers&apos; gustation who is generally accustomed to nicotine, so that withdrawal symptoms originated from prohibition or moderation of smoking could not be fundamentally suppressed. Accordingly, it is often the case that a smoker cannot help smoking, so that their effectiveness has a certain limit. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The composition for suppressing craving for smoking (hereinafter referred to as the composition) of the present invention is highly suitable for treating any situations in which cigarette or nicotine-based withdrawal symptoms (hereinafter referred to as withdrawal symptoms) can take place. The exhibition of the desired effects of the composition of the present invention is based on action for suppressing the craving for smoking found for the first time in theanine contained in the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;suppressing craving for smoking&rdquo; refers to, for example, alleviating withdrawal symptoms and suppressing an onset of the withdrawal symptoms, thereby suppressing craving for smoking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;nicotine&rdquo; refers to an active ingredient in tobacco products. It has been known that nicotine is a dependence-producing drug and is easily absorbed internally and reaches the brain after about eight seconds. Nicotine affects the pleasure center of cerebrum (central nervous system) to provide pleasure. If one continues smoking for craving the pleasure, so-called cigarette or nicotine dependence may occur, wherein certain changes take place in the brain, and body conditioning gets worse in a case of nonsmoking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, &ldquo;theanine&rdquo; used in the present invention is a glutamic acid derivative (&ggr;-glutamyl ethylamide), and is an amino acid ingredient contained largely in tea leaves naturally. Although an action mechanism of the action for suppressing the craving for smoking by theanine found for the first time in the present invention is yet unknown and not expected from various physiological functions conventionally known, as shown in Examples set forth below, there has been acknowledged association between the changes in the theanine blood concentration after theanine administration and the exhibition of suppressive action of withdrawal symptoms from the results of tests conducted for smokers with nicotine dependence. Therefore, the transfer of theanine into the brain after the administration would have some association with the exhibition of the effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Methods for preparing theanine used in the present invention may be any of known methods, including a method of extracting from tea leaves; a method for obtaining theanine by an organic synthesis method &lsqb;<highlight><italic>Chem. Pharm. Bull., </italic></highlight>19(7), 1301-1307 (1971)&rsqb;; a method for obtaining theanine, comprising treating a mixture of glutamine and ethylamine with glutaminase (Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. Hei 7-55154); a method comprising culturing cultured cells of tea in a medium containing ethylamine, thereby achieving growth promotion of the cultured cells while increasing the cumulative amount of theanine in the cultured cells (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 5-123166); a method for obtaining theanine in which ethylamine is substituted by an ethylamine derivative such as ethylamine hydrochloride in the above-mentioned method disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. Hei 7-55154 or Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 5-123166; and the like. In addition, the theanine used in the present invention may be of any forms, such as purified products, crudely purified products, extracts, and the like. Also, a commercially available product &lsqb;SUNTHEANINE (registered trade mark), manufactured by Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd.&rsqb; may be used. Incidentally, the term &ldquo;tea leaves&rdquo; as referred to herein include those of green tea, oolong tea and black tea. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition, any of L-theanine, D-theanine and DL-theanine can be used, among which the L-form is preferred in the present invention, because it is approved as a food additive, and is economically utilizable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The theanine content in the composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, as long as the desired effect of the present invention is achieved. The theanine content is usually preferably from 0.001 to 100% by weight, more preferably from 0.01 to 100% by weight, and especially preferably from 0.1 to 100% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A method of detecting theanine in the composition of the present invention is not particularly limited. It is preferable that the method comprises derivatizing in pre-column by orthophthalaldehyde (OPA), separating by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ODS column, and detecting and quantifying with a fluorescence detector, or the method comprises separating by HPLC using ODS column, and detecting and quantifying at a wavelength of 210 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition, other various components can be used together with theanine in the composition of the present invention properly. The other components are not particularly limited, and include, for instance, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, other functional materials and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned amino acids are not particularly limited, and include, for example, glutamine, glutamic acid, tryptophan, alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, threonine, serine, &ggr;-aminobutyric acid, taurine, tiotaurine, hypotaurine, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned vitamins include, for example, vitamin A, vitamin B<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, vitamin B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, vitamin B<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, vitamin B<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, folic acid, nicotinic acid, lipoic acid, pantothenic acid, biotin, ubiquinone, prostaglandin and the like, and derivatives of these vitamins, without intending to be limited to these alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned minerals include, for example, calcium, iron, magnesium, copper, zinc, selenium, potassium and the like, without intending to be limited thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the above-mentioned other functional materials include, for example, St. John&apos;s wort, herbs such as Chamomile, Gymnema/Garcinia, plants pertaining to Chinese-style medicine such as Eucommia ulmoides and Pnanx ginnseng or extracts thereof, extracts of animal origins such as placenta, dietary fiber, soy peptide, diet sweetener, caffeine and the like, without intending to be limited thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As the form of the composition of the present invention, a food composition or a pharmaceutical composition is preferable, from the viewpoint of its suitability for the daily use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The food composition of the present invention encompasses not only a food comprising theanine but also a food additive comprising theanine. In the case of making the food composition, theanine may be added to, for example, the following foods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Specifically, theanine can be added to a solid food or a liquid food. The solid food is not particularly limited, and preferably includes tablet confectioneries, candies, chocolates, gum, crackers, biscuits, cookies, paste products, processed soy products, mousse, jelly, yogurt, cold confectioneries, cake, bread and the like. The liquid food is also not particularly limited, and theanine may be preferably added to a table luxury beverage such as fruit juice concentrates, reconstituted juice concentrates, fresh juices, mixed fruit juices, fruit grain-containing fruit juice, fruit juice-containing beverages, mixed fruit/vegetable juice, vegetable juice, carbonated beverages, soft drinks, mineral water, milk, milk beverage and coffee, or an alcoholic beverage such as Japanese sake, beer, wine, cocktails, shochu, and whiskey, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Among them, a preparation suitable for absorption via the oral mucosa is preferred. For instance, a solid food in the form which can be sustained in the mouth for a given length of time, such as a tablet confectionery, a candy or gum, is especially preferred. In the case of the solid food, theanine can be gradually released in the mouth. By that action, theanine is absorbed internally via mainly the oral mucosa. When theanine is absorbed via the oral mucosa, theanine would be transported into the brain more efficiently than the case through the portal system, whereby its action can be exhibited. On the other hand, when considering oral intake, since it may be difficult to use gum depending on the kind of an occupation and a situation of a workplace, the form of tablet confectionery or candy is more preferable. With respect to these various forms, as those suitable for absorption via the oral mucosa, a dosage form sustainable in the mouth for at least three minutes when orally taken is preferred. Moreover, the size and the form are preferably those which would be difficult to chew down and swallow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the case of making the composition of the present invention into a pharmaceutical composition, its form, which is based on known pharmaceutical compositions, may be any of solutions, suspensions, powders, solid molded products and the like without being particularly limited thereto. Therefore, the pharmaceutical composition is provided as tablets (including not only general tablet but also troche and the like), capsules, powdered agents, granules, health care drinks and the like. The pharmaceutical composition can also be used in combination with other medicaments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as in the case of the food composition, those suitable for absorption via the oral mucosa are preferred. Accordingly, from the viewpoint of absorbing theanine internally without mediating portal system, as the form of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, tablets, especially troche or a sublingual tablet, are preferred. The sublingual tablet is not particularly limited, as long as the tablet can be placed under the tongue. It is desirable that the tablet preferably disintegrates in three to six minutes, whereby theanine can be released to sublingual mucosa rapidly. The means for disintegration is not particularly limited, and may follow a conventional method. By the use of the sublingual tablet, theanine is absorbed via sublingual mucosa and can be efficiently transported into the brain, so that the sublingual tablet is especially suitable for the treatment of acute withdrawal symptoms or the treatment of transient nicotine craving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A process for preparing the composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, and there can be used general processes for preparation of a food and a medicament such as a process of powder-mixing theanine and other raw materials; a process of dissolving theanine and other raw materials in a solvent to give a mixed solution; and a process of freeze-drying the mixed solution; a process of spray-drying the mixed solution. For example, a pharmaceutical composition can be prepared by mixing theanine with a vehicle, a carrier, a binder, a stabilizer and the like, which are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> By the use of the composition of the present invention, there can be performed, for instance, (1) the suppression of craving for smoking in a situation where nonsmoking is mandatory in the daily life. For an individual having a smoking habit who does not wish to eliminate the habit of smoking, it may be very difficult to quit smoking for a given period of time, whether short or long. The situation where nonsmoking is mandatory includes, for example, the situation during the use of public transportations such as air planes and the situation in a hospital. In these cases the craving for smoking can be suppressed efficiently by the use of the composition of the present invention so that smoking can be stopped without causing any problems. However, the suppressive action is not persistent unnecessarily for a long period of time, and smoking can be restarted easily once the period of time where nonsmoking is mandatory has passed. Such a flexibility of suppressing the craving for smoking and restarting smoking is very excellent aspect as compared to the suppression of the craving for smoking by conventional nicotine substitute such as nicotine pad which may unnecessarily sustain the suppressive effect for the craving for smoking. Particularly in recent years, there is an increase in a situation where nonsmoking is mandatory along with the progress of understanding about harmful action of cigarette consumption and nicotine intake accompanied therewith, so that the embodiment of the use of the composition of the present invention mentioned above is especially preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Moreover, there can be performed (2) prohibition or moderation of smoking intentionally (when unrestricted) by using the composition of the present invention. When an individual having a habit of smoking who does not wish to eliminate the habit tries to stop or moderate smoking under a direction of a physician, when an individual tries to stop smoking during the contact with an infant, or the like, the craving for smoking can be suppressed efficiently by using the composition of the present invention, so that smoking can be stopped or moderated without causing any problems. In addition, in the same manner as mentioned above, in a case where intentional prohibition or moderation for smoking is no longer necessary, smoking cigarettes can be restarted at once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Further, there can be performed (3) complete elimination of a smoking habit by taking the composition of the present invention continuously. It is said that there are generally a few individuals having confidence about quitting smoking among smokers who are starting to stop smoking. This is especially true when an individual had given up on quitting smoking in some of past challenges due to painful withdrawal symptoms after starting to quit smoking. However, since the craving for smoking can be suppressed efficiently by using the composition of the present invention, nonsmoking can be continued without causing any problems, and finally, the smoking habit can be completely eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Moreover, by using the composition under the appropriate instruction or counseling for quitting smoking, a further effect can be expected. Hitherto, in the instruction or the like, nicotine preparations such as nicotine gum and nicotine pad have been used as anti-smoking supplement. However, nicotine is highly toxic and is contraindicated in individuals with unstable angina, individuals with myocardial infarction, gravida, women who are possibly pregnant and the like. The above-mentioned anti-smoking supplement should be prescribed for the purpose that an individual who intends to stop smoking may use it by himself under a proper direction. If another individual uses the anti-smoking supplement, it is not necessarily safe. Particularly, in the case of passing the anti-smoking supplement to the contraindicative individual by hand-over, there has been a possibility of causing a situation with risk. Moreover, a nicotine preparation serves as a temporary substitute of source of nicotine, which had been taken from cigarettes, so that dependence to the nicotine preparation may take place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Since the theanine used in the composition of the present invention is completely safe component as mentioned below and has no possibility of theanine dependence, an addictive smoker can eliminate the smoking habit safely and effectively by the use of the composition under the direction for quitting smoking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As described above, by the use of the composition of the present invention, since withdrawal symptoms caused by prohibition or moderation of smoking can be prevented, alleviated or eliminated, the above-mentioned various embodiments of use can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a method for prohibiting or moderating smoking, comprising administering to an individual (human) a composition comprising theanine. In the method, the use of the composition of the present invention is preferred. An effective dose of theanine in order to obtain the desired effect of the present invention in the above-mentioned embodiment of use of the composition of the present invention is, generally, preferably from 0.1 to 50 mg/kg weight per day, more preferably from 0.5 to 20 mg/kg weight, still more preferably from 1 to 20 mg/kg weight, especially preferably from 4 to 20 mg/kg weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The timing of using the composition of the present invention is not particularly limited. For instance, the composition may be previously administered when withdrawal symptoms are presumed to be caused by prohibition or moderation for smoking, or may be administered during occurrence of withdrawal symptoms. In a more specific embodiment, when a smoker wishes to temporarily treat withdrawal symptoms, the composition is administered to the smoker before or during the experience of withdrawal symptoms, the smoker being preferably a smoker who cannot help smoking during cigarette- or nicotine-deficient state for a long period of time, for instance, a smoker who has a habit of smoking within fifteen minutes from the point of waking. The smoker is administered in an effective dose per dosage of the theanine sufficient to suppress the craving for smoking, for instance, upon waking, which is preferably from 0.02 to 10 mg/kg weight, more preferably from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg weight, still more preferably from 0.8 to 10 mg/kg weight. On the other hand, when a smoker wishes to completely eliminate the smoking habit, it is desirable to administer an effective dose per dosage of the theanine sufficient to suppress the craving for smoking preferably for at least three hours or so, more preferably for five hours or so, for instance, upon beginning of the craving for smoking, which is preferably from 0.02 to 10 mg/kg weight, more preferably from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg weight, still more preferably from 0.8 to 10 mg/kg weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> However, since there are differences (e.g. age, gender) between individuals in a level of smoking habit or withdrawal symptoms, the dosage of theanine in the present invention is not particularly limited to the above range. The dosage of theanine is may be properly adjusted depending upon each smoker&apos;s state and a desired effect level. Also, the number and interval of administration can be properly selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Further, as another embodiment of the present invention, the present invention provides use of theanine for preparing a medicament for preventing, alleviating or eliminating withdrawal symptoms caused by prohibition or moderation of smoking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The composition of the present invention is based on action for suppressing the craving for smoking that has been found for the theanine for the first time. The theanine has been known to be a main ingredient of sapidity in tea and used as a food additive for the sapidity. As to its safety, there is no case of death in acute toxicity test using mice with oral administration at 5 g/kg weight, and there is no abnormality in the general state and body weight. There is no limitation in an amount of addition based on the Food Hygiene Law. Further, unlike a conventional nicotine preparation, since there is no dependence, the composition of the present invention can suppress the craving for smoking safely and effectively. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Preparation of L-Theanine by Enzymatic Method </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> 0.3 M glutamine and 1.5 M ethylamine were allowed to react at 30&deg; C. for 22 hours in borate buffer (Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>B<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>&mdash;NaOH, pH 11) in the presence of 0.3 U glutaminase, to give 225 nmol of L-theanine. In addition, a by-product glutamic acid was 20 nmol. The purification of theanine from the reaction mixture was carried out by subjecting the reaction mixture to column chromatography using Dowex 50&times;8 column and Dowex 1&times;2 column, and thereafter treating the resulting product with ethanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> First, L-theanine was identified by subjecting the isolated substance obtained by the above-mentioned purification to amino acid analyzer and paper chromatography, whereby confirming that the isolated substance exhibits the same behaviors as the standard substance. Moreover, when the isolated substance was subjected to hydrolysis treatment with hydrochloric acid or glutaminase, glutamic acid and ethylamine were generated at a ratio of 1:1. Since the isolated substance was hydrolyzed by glutaminase, it was shown that ethylamine was bonded at the &ggr;-position of glutamic acid. In addition, it was also confirmed by using the glutamic acid dehydrogenase that glutamic acid generated by hydrolysis had an L-form. From the above, the resulting compound was finally confirmed to be L-theanine. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Ten kilograms of tea leaves (<highlight><italic>Camellia sinensis L</italic></highlight>.) were subjected to extraction with boiling water. The resulting extract was then applied to a cationic exchange resin (&ldquo;Dowex HCR W-2,&rdquo; manufactured by Muromachi Kagaku Kogyo K.K.), and eluted with 1 N NaOH. The eluted fraction was applied to an activated carbon (&ldquo;Taiko Kasseitan SG&rdquo; manufactured by Futamura Kagaku Kogyo K.K.), and eluted with 15% ethanol. The resulting eluted fraction was concentrated with an RO membrane (manufactured by NITTO DENKO CORPORATION &ldquo;NTR 729 HF&rdquo;). Thereafter, the concentrate was purified by column chromatography. Furthermore, the purified product was recrystallized, to give 24.8 g of L-theanine. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> If smokers are classified by the changes of the blood nicotine concentration within one day, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the smokers can be classified into (A) Peak-seeker Type and (B) Trough-maintainer Type. The Peak-seeker Type smokers are largely seen in so-called &ldquo;heavy smokers,&rdquo; who keep on puffing in order to avoid the lowering of the blood nicotine level. The nicotine in the body is accumulated, and reaches a given level by the afternoon. On the other hand, the Trough-maintainer Type smokers are those who seek for smoking stimulation periodically, and the number of cigarettes which they smoke is small. The peak of the blood nicotine concentration is clearly found. In this test, in order to study on the suppressive effect of craving for smoking by theanine, a test was conducted in a state of immediately after waking, at which body nicotine concentration is the lowest (Tests 1 and 2 Immediate After Waking). Further, as is seen in the Peak-seeker Type smokers, a test was conducted in the afternoon at which the nicotine concentration presumably reaches the highest level during the day (Daytime Test). Also, an effect of continuous intake within a day was also studied. Specifically, it was studied whether or not a time period until a smoker makes a first puff after waking can be significantly extended by an intake of theanine, whether or not the interval of puffing during the day can be significantly extended by the intake, and whether or not the number of cigarettes which they smoke are significantly decreased by the intake. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Fifty of those subjects which had a dependency of moderate level or higher in item (1) above, and habit of smoking within 15 minutes from waking (average body weight: 73 kg) were selected as subjects, and subjected to a test. In the test, a test substance listed in Table 2 was taken immediately after waking (within about 15 minutes after waking), and they recorded a time period from the intake of the test substance to a first puff (pre-smoking time period) was studied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The subjects were divided into 5 groups (10 persons per group), and each subject was allowed to take any of the test substances in Table 2 assigned to each group every day from Monday to Friday, and the pre-smoking time period was determined. Based on the data of the obtained pre-smoking time period, the average time period was determined for each test substance, each of which was shown in Table 2 as the pre-smoking time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> During the test period, each of the subjects was not informed which of the test substances the subjects were allowed to take. During the test period, there were no restriction on their life including smoking, except for the intake of the test substance immediately after waking.

About 74% of the subjects smoked 21 or more cigarettes per day, and about 83% of the subjects started a first puff of the day within 30 minutes after waking. This group was deduced to be a group which is relatively strongly nicotine-dependent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The test results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The test was carried out for two groups: the group of the entire subjects and the group of the subjects smoking within 30 minutes after waking. The test substance containing theanine had a greater smoking suppressive effect than that of the placebo, showing that a smoking suppressive effect was 2 hours or longer after the intake. The placebo group and the test substance group each showed a statistically significant difference. Here, the test was carried out by Student paired t-test. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> As the test chewable tablet, the L-theanine formulated chewable tablet of Example 1 containing 200 mg of L-theanine was used. A smoker showing high nicotine dependency &lsqb;the same subject A as in item (i) Intake of Theanine: 87 mg above&rsqb; was subjected to this test. The subject A was allowed to take one tablet of chewable tablet of Example 1 with tasting for 6 minutes after 150 minutes from waking. In addition, the subject was prohibited from smoking for 150 minutes after waking. Blood was collected before the intake of the chewable tablet of Example 1, and after 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes and 180 minutes from the intake. During the test, the presence or absence and extent of craving for smoking was questioned according to the criteria shown in Table 5, and the withdrawal symptoms were observed. Here, the blood theanine concentration was determined in the same manner as in the case of item (i) Intake of Theanine: 87 mg above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The changes in the blood theanine concentration (ppm) with the passage of time when the L-theanine formulated chewable tablet (theanine content: 200 mg) was subjected to oral mucosa absorption or intestinal absorption are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As the oral mucosa absorption and the intestinal absorption are compared, the time period for reaching the maximal blood theanine concentration is shorter in the oral mucosa absorption, whereby confirming a quicker absorption in the oral mucosa absorption. In addition, from the fact that the maximal value of the blood theanine concentration is higher in the oral mucosa absorption, it was confirmed that the oral mucosa absorption shows a good absorption rate. However, the blood theanine concentration was sustained for a longer duration in the intestinal absorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In addition, in item (1) oral mucosa absorption test above, cravings for smoking before, during and after the test were monitored with the passage of time as mentioned above. The changes in the cravings for smoking with the passage of time and the changes in the blood theanine concentration when theanine was taken in an amount of 87 mg, and when theanine was taken in an amount of 200 mg are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the cravings for smoking of the subject A before, during and after the test were monitored with the passage of time. Immediately before taking the test substance, since the subject was prohibited from smoking for 150 minutes after waking, there was occurrence of a strong craving for smoking, and moderate withdrawal symptoms were found. However, after the intake, the craving for smoking dramatically disappeared, and thereafter the changes in the craving for smoking were suppressed almost in a blood theanine concentration-dependent manner. As compared to the case of intake of theanine: 200 mg, the blood theanine concentration of the case of intake of theanine: 87 mg is low, so that the craving for smoking is relatively high from the beginning of the test, and the craving for smoking appears after 60 minutes, and the craving cannot be suppressed after 140 minutes and the subject smokes thereat. As a result, the subject did not smoke for 290 minutes after waking. On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, in the case of intake of theanine: 200 mg, the cravings for smoking of the subject A before, during and after the test were monitored with the passage of time. Immediately before taking the L-theanine formulated chewable tablet, since the subject was prohibited from smoking for 150 minutes after waking, there was occurrence of a strong craving for smoking, and moderate withdrawal symptoms were found. However, after the intake, the craving for smoking dramatically disappeared, and thereafter the changes in the craving for smoking, with some variations, were suppressed almost in a blood theanine concentration-dependent manner. The craving for smoking appeared at a point of 150 minutes after the beginning of the test, and the subject finally smoked at a point of 165 minutes. Consequently, the subject did not smoke for 315 minutes after waking. The subject A had a habit of usually smoking immediately after waking, but it is found that his craving for smoking can be effectively suppressed by taking theanine in an amount of about 90 to about 200 mg. In addition, the suppressive effect was deduced to be associated with the changes in the blood theanine concentration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Summary of Test Examples 1 and 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> In the short-term nicotine dependency calming test, tests were conducted immediately after waking, at which the body nicotine concentration is presumably at the lowest level and in a daytime, at which the body nicotine concentration is presumably at a high level. In either case, a significant suppressive effect for smoking was exhibited by an intake of theanine (200 mg) in subjects of which nicotine dependencies were judged moderate level or higher. Especially, &ldquo;Daytime Test&rdquo; was performed in an actual business location. Although there would be various factors (noise) inducing smoking, an effect of theanine could be confirmed. In addition, in the continuous intake within a day which was also performed, the effect of intake of theanine was tested in a usual life, wherein a significant decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked was seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the long-term nicotine dependency calming test, even with a one-week continuous intake of theanine of about 400 mg per day, it was shown that the subject may result in quitting smoking in some cases. During a one-month continuous intake, a nonsmoking effect or a suppressive effect for craving for smoking was found in all the cases of the recipients. Also, no undesirable adverse action or theanine dependencies were found. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the oral mucosa absorption test and the intestinal absorption test, it was shown that the theanine was more quickly absorbed via the oral mucosa and its absorption rate was higher, as compared to the intestinal absorption, and that the suppressive effect for craving for smoking by the theanine was associated with the blood theanine concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> It is seen from the above that according to the composition for suppressing craving for smoking comprising theanine of the present invention, the craving for smoking can be significantly suppressed by a suitable intake of the composition, even in a smoker whose nicotine dependency level is moderate or higher, whereby intentional (when unrestricted) prohibition or moderation of smoking, and complete elimination of the smoking habit can be safely and effectively achieved. In addition, it is seen that the intake of theanine is more effective by carrying out with a composition suitable for absorption via the oral mucosa as concretely illustrated herein. </paragraph>
