<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention of this application relates to a probe for protein-protein interaction analysis, and to a method of using such probe for the analysis of protein-protein interactions. More precisely, the invention relates to a probe for protein-protein interaction analysis and to a method of using it for analysis of protein-protein interactions, which enables accurate and simple analysis of protein-protein interactions in all living cells. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is well known that protein-protein interactions play key roles in structural and functional organization of living cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Many unsolved problems currently studied in molecular biology and biochemistry, such as for gene transcription mechanism and intracellular information transmission are related to protein-protein interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Some of the problems in the art of molecular biology and biochemistry have been gradually solved by the development of protein library screening techniques such as a two-hybrid strategy, in which a library of &ldquo;target&rdquo; proteins is screened for interaction with &ldquo;bait&rdquo; proteins (Chien, C. T., Bartel, P. L., Sternglanz, R., Fields, <highlight><italic>S., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1991, 88, 9578-9582; </bold></highlight>Fields, S., Song, O., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>1989, 340, 245-246). The two-hybrid method facilitates the identification of potential protein-protein interactions and has been proposed et an effective method for the generation of protein interaction maps (Flores, A., Briand, J. F., Gadal, O., Andrau, J. C., Rubbi, L., Mullem, V., Boachiero, C., Goussout, M., Marck, C., Carles, C., Thuriaua, P., Sentenac, A., Werner, M., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nacl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>1999, 96, 7819-7820; Ito, T.. Tashiro, K.. Nuta, S., Ozawa, R., Chiba, T., Nishizawa, M., Yamamoto, K., Kuhara, S.. Sakaki, Y., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>1999, 97, 1143-1147; Walhout, A. J. M., Sordella, R., Lu, X., Hartley, J. L., Temple. G. F., Brasch, M. A., Thierry-Mieg, H., Vidal, M.. <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>2000, 287, 116-122). However, the two-hybrid method has a problem in that it is applicable only to the detectable protein interactions that occur around the reporter gene in cell nuclei, but not to any other ordinary protein-protein interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another problem with the two-hybrid method is that its reliability is low. Therefore, every assay according to the method must be followed by an additional confirmation test using proteins of model cells or animals of which the functional data are known (Walhout, A. J. M., et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>1999, 287, 116-122). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Given that situation, other protein-protein interaction assay strategies have been developed. One in a ubiquities split protein sensor (USPS) method which comprises reconstructing N- and C-terminal ubiquities through protein-protein interaction, followed by activating the nuclear-localized reporter through transcription factor cleavage (Dunnwald, M., Varchavoky, A., Johnsson, N., <highlight><italic>Mol. Biol. Cell </italic></highlight>1999, 10, 329-344; Johnsson, N., Varshavsky, A., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>1998. 95, 5187-5192: Stagljar, I., Korostensky, C., Johnoson,.N., Heesen, S., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>1998, 95, 5187-5192); another is an SOS recruit system, in which a catalyst domain is brought near to an intended membrane localization domain through protein-protein interaction thereby reconstructing a guanine exchange factor (GEF) or Ras, which then complements yeast causing temperature-sensitive mutation in yeast GEF (Aonheim, A., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>1997, 25, 3373-3374; Aronheim, A., Zandi, E. Hennemann, H., Elledge, S. J., Karin, M., <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>1997, 17, 3094-3102; Broder, Y. C., Katz, S., Aronheim, A., <highlight><italic>Curr. Biol. </italic></highlight>1998, 8, 1121-1124). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As a more general approach, split enzyme technology has been reported (Rossi, F., Charlton, C. A. and Blau, H. M., Proc. <highlight><italic>Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>1997, 94, 8405-8410; Remy, I., Michnick, S. W., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>1999, 96, 5394-5399; Pelletier, J. N., Arndt, K. M., pluckthun, A., Michnick, S. W., <highlight><italic>Nature Biotech. </italic></highlight>1999, 17, 683-690). It is said that, according to the method, a split enzyme is reconstructed through protein-protein interaction therein, and its enzymatic activity is restored. Further, it is said that the activity of the thus-reconstructed enzyme can be identified by it cellular phenotype or by its fluorescent substrate analogues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These various methods produce accurate assay data in some degree and are well suited for assaying interactions between intracellular proteins and membrane-proximal proteins, however, they still contain problems in that they can be applicable to only appropriately engineered cells. Another such problem is that their accuracy is still unsatisfactory and their sensitivity is not sufficient Still another problem is that such methods require different substrates and are therefore troublesome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> At present, a general method applicable to any protein that enables accurate and simple analysis of various protein-protein interactions, or an all-purpose probe for such method is not known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention of the present application has been made in consideration of the above described situations, and its object is to solve the problems of the prior art and to provide an all-purpose probe applicable for various protein-protein interaction analysis and a method of protein-protein interaction analysis using such probe, which enables accurate and simple assay of the interaction of proteins. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The probe for protein-protein interaction analysis of the present invention is based on the principle that the interaction of two proteins each linked to the probes induces splicing thereby regenerating the labeled protein split and attached to the two probes, to emit a signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Protein splicing is a process wherein the internal protein segment (intein) is excised from a translated protein. In this process, the excision of inteins is accompanied by the ligation of flanking sequences (exteins) (Gimble, F. S., <highlight><italic>Sci . Biol. </italic></highlight>1998, 5, R251-256). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The probe for protein-protein interaction analysis of the present invention is provided by ingeniously applying the self-excision of inteins to protein-protein interaction analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In other words, the probe for protein-protein interaction analysis of the present invention consist of two probes a and b each separately connected to two different proteins. Pig. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a schematic representation of the principle of the probe for protein-protein interaction analysis of the present invention of the two probes a (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and b (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) , probe a (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) contains the N-terminal polypeptide of an intein (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and the N-terminal polypeptide of a labeled protein (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>); and probe (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) contains the c-terminal polypeptide of the intein (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and the C-terminal polypeptide of the labeled protein (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)The two probes a (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and b (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are separately connected to the respective proteins A (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and B (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) for which interaction is to be analyzed, to detect the protein A-protein B interaction. Hence, when protein A (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and protein B (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) each connected to probe a (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and probe b (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), respectively, coexist (I) and when the two proteins (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) interact with each other (II), the intein (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is excised through splicing (III). As a result the labeled protein sites (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) bonded to the intein (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are ligated (IV), thereby enabling the confirmation of the protein-protein interaction through detection of the signal resulting from the labeled protein (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In this process, if protein A (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) does not interact with protein B(<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), splicing of intein (III) does not occur; therefore, the labeled protein (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is not regenerated (IV) and is not detectable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> For the probe for protein-protein interaction analysis of the present invention, probes a and b (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) may each be composed of the intein polypeptide and the labeled protein polypeptide, but may contain other parts such as a linker sequence. Accordingly, in probes a and b (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the intein polypeptide (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and the labeled protein polypeptides (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) may be directly bonded to each other, or may be bonded via any other polypeptide such as linker sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The intein may be derived from various known organisms. It includes, for example, those derived from eukaryotes such as <highlight><italic>Saccheromyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>(yeast) Sce VMA, <highlight><italic>Candida tropiallis </italic></highlight>(Candida fungi) Ctr VKA; those derived from eubacteria such as <highlight><italic>Mycbbacterium tuberculosis </italic></highlight>(tubercle bacillus) Mtu recA; and those derived from paleobacteria such as <highlight><italic>Thermoplasma asidophilum </italic></highlight>Tac VMA. In addition, <highlight><italic>Cyanobacterium synechocystis </italic></highlight>sp. (cyanobacterium) DnaE may also serve as the intein for use in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When protein A (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) interacts with protein B (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) in the presence of the probes for protein-protein interaction analysis (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the present invention, the inteins are preferably site-specific endonucleases for facilitating automatic intein excision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Specifically, intein derived from yeast VMA and Sop DnaE intein derived from cyanobacterium are preferable. In yeast VMA, the nascent translation product, 120-kDa VMA1, catalyzes protein splicing to give a 70-kDa H*-ATPase sub-unit and a 50-kDA site-specific endonuclease (VDE, or PI-SceI). This VDE is preferably used as the intein sites (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) in the probes for protein-protein interaction analysis (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). For the Sep DnaE derived from cyanobacterium, the DNA sequence of the strain PCC6803 has been determined (the N-terminal has 123 amino acid residues and the C-terminal has 36 amino acide residues); further, Ssp DnaE intein is a natural split intein, and is known that the ligation of N- and C-extein occurs (Wu, H., Hu, Z., Liu, X. -Q., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>1999, 95, 9226-9231). Therefore Ssp DnaE intein is easy to handle, and preferred as the intein sites (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) in the present probes for protein-protein interaction analysis (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Of the various inteins mentioned above, the cyanobacterium-derived Ssp DnaE intein is most preferable for enabling highly sensitive detection of protein-protein interactions in mammal cells. It is needless to say, that any other known or novel inteins may also be employed in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For effective intein splicing (III) with the probes for protein-protein interaction analysis (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the present invention, probes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>must be correctly folded so that the two sites participating in protein splicing are adjacent to each other and are correctly aligned (Duan, X., aimble, F. S. and Quiocho, F. A., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>1997, 89, 555-564). Accordingly, as inteins, those derived from organisms may directly be used or may be suitably modified for facilitating the intended intein splicing by, for example, partly substituting the amino acid residues of the organisms-derived intein with any other residue, partly deleting amino acid residues, or introducing a suitable linker sequence thereinto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For example, for the above-mentioned VDE, it is known that its mutant specifically designed by deletion of the endonuclease domain and substitution with a foldable diode captive linker shows an increased splicing activity (Cooper, A- A., Chen, Y. J., Lindorfer, M. A., Stevens, T. H., <highlight><italic>EMOJ. </italic></highlight>1993, 12, 2575-2583; Chong, S., Xu, M. -Q., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>1997, 272, 15587-15590). On the other hand, the cyanobacterium-derived Sop DnaE is a natural split intein, as mentioned above, and is known to lead to correctly folded splicing. Therefore, linker sequence may or may not be introduced into it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As described herein above, the intein is split into the N-terminal polypeptide (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and the C-terminal polypeptide (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In the probes (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) for protein-protein interaction analysis of the present invention, the split polypeptides (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are bonded to the N-terminal polypeptide (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of a labeled protein and the C-terminal polypeptide (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) thereof, respectively, to construct a probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, for the probes for protein-protein interaction analysis (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the present invention, the labeled protein sites to be used undergo direct peptide bonding and link to each other (IV) through the interaction of proteins A an B (II), followed by the intein splicing from probes a and b (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) (III). The labeled protein (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) may be any protein that can be detected after protein linkage (IV). For example, fluorescent protein and emission-catalyzing enzyme are preferable. As a fluorescent protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP), which emits light after protein linkage, enabling visual detection, is preferable. For the emission-catalyzing enzyme, luciferase that forms an activity center after protein linkage and emits light that is easily detected is preferred. For the split N- and C-terminals of the luciferase to give no fluorescence when separated and restore its emission activity after its two terminals are recombined, the luciferase must be split so that its activity center is divided into two. It is known that the enzyme luciferase is folded into two domains that sandwich a broad activity center-containing region therebetween; one is a large N-terminal domain comprising one &bgr;-barrel and two &bgr;-sheets and the other is a C-terminal site (Waud, J. P., Sala-Newby, G. B., Matthews, S- B., Campbell, A. K., <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>1996, 1292, 89-98; Conti. E. Franks, N. P., Brick, P., <highlight><italic>Structure </italic></highlight>1996, 4, 287-298). Accordingly, it is desirable that the enzyme luciferase is split into two, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>at the flexible side through which the two domains are linked to each other. For the enzyme luciferase, it is further known that its N-terminal polypeptide (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), to which the N-terminal polypeptide of the intein (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is to be bonded, has a cysteine (Cys) residue and further has a tyrosine (Tyr) residue &minus;1 upstream to it and alanine (Ala) and phenylalanine (Phe) residues &minus;3 and &minus;4 upstream to it, respectively; therefore, the enzyme luciferane enables more efficient protein splicing. Hence, for using the enzyme luciferase in the present invention, it is recommended that the enzyme be mutated into mutants R437C for which the 437 tharginine is substituted with cysteine, D436Y for which the 436 thaspartic residue is substituted with tyrosine, and I434A for which the 434th isoleucine residue is substituted with alanine, to enable a more efficient protein splicing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An mentioned hereinabove, the invention of this application provides the probe for protein-protein interaction analysis. Concretely, one probe (e.g., probe a) is linked to the target protein (protein A) of which the ability of interaction with another protein (protein B) in to be confirmed, while another probe (probe b) is linked to the other protein (protein B); and the two probes are made to coexist in a system to thereby confirm the presence or absence of interaction between proteins A and B by the above-mentioned principle and mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The proteins (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) may be linked with the probes (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) by any method as long as the properties of the proteins and the probes are not affected. For example, any ordinary chemical, biochemical or genetic engineering strategies are applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The method of using the probe for protein-protein interaction analysis of the invention for detecting and analyzing protein-protein interactions (e.g., through luminometry) is not limited, and may be done by any ordinary means. Experimental methods and detectors generally used in the field of chemistry and biochemistry may be employed. For example, a luminometer, which enable simple detection and analysis is preferable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Construction of Probe &lt;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt; for protein-protein interaction analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As the intein site of probe &lt;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt; for protein-protein interaction analysis, a yeast VMA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-derived intein (VDE) was used of the 454 amino acids constituting VDE, Cyal is the first amino acid residue and Asn454 is the last amino acid residue. For VDE, the C-extein starts from Cyo4S5, and the extein residue adjacent to Cys1 is numbered &minus;1. The subsequent extein residues are numbered &minus;2, &minus;3, . . . consecutively toward the N-extein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> For the labeled site, an Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein derived from <highlight><italic>Aequoea victoria </italic></highlight>(EGFP, described, for example, in <highlight><italic>Current Biology </italic></highlight>1996, 6 (2), 178-182) was used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In probe &lt;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt; , as the splicing site, the N-terminal half of EGFP requires one Cys residue, another Gly residue upstream of the position of &minus;1, and three hydrophobic amino acid residues at their positions of &minus;5, &minus;4 and &minus;3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Accordingly the I124th to I129th amino acid residues that are relatively stable in the N-terminal polypeptide structure of EGFP were substituted as follows (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> (1) I129C and E125I mutation in EGFP showed fluorescence, and excitation and emission peaks equivalent to those of EGFP at 488 nm and 510 nm were observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> (2) Fluorescence disappeared with L126Y mutation at m125, although the expression level of the mutant did not vary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The results indicate that L126Y mutation disables correct folding in the m129EGFP mutant and/or ligation of the fluorescent protein sites could not take place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, m125EGFP mutant for which I129C and E125I mutation was performed was used as the labeled protein site of the probe. This libeled protein site is hereinafter referred to as an EGFP mutant. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To confirm whether protein splicing occurs in a single polypeptide in which VDE is sandwiched between the N-terminal and the C-terminal halves of the EGFP mutant, POEX-NVC was expressed at 25&deg; C. in <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> (1) Cells of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DH5&agr; were incubated to express a glutathion S-transferase fused protein(GST). A plasmid that covers the VDE region and the N- and C-terminal polypeptides of the EGFP mutant was fused to the OST gene under control or a tac promoter. This produced a chimera protein consisting of GST (26 kDa), 125 residues from the N-terminal of the EGFP mutant (13 kDa), VDE (50 kDa) and the C-terminal polypeptide of the mutant (14 kDa). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (2) The resulting protein was extracted from the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>cello, purified and identified through SDS-PAGE. The labeled protein and 10 to 225-kDa (Novagen) were electrophoresed on 12 to 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For Western blotting, anti-VDE polyclonal antibody, anti-His-labeled polyclonal antibody (Santa Crus Biotechnology) or anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (BioRad) was used as the probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The enzymes necessary for cloning were all obtained from Takara Biomedical, and processed according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The PCR fragments were sequenced using a genetic analyzer, ABI310. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The main component of the crude product was a protein of abut 50-kDa (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). This result corresponds with the size of the extein linked to VDE (50 kDa) and CST. In other words, this component was determined to be a fused protein of CST and the N-terminal polypetide of the EGFP mutant (26 kDa&plus;13 kDa). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> From this result, it was found that the 103-kDa precursor of the fused protein was split into the 50-kDa VDE and the 53-kDa GST-EGFP mutant fused protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In addition, the molecular weight of VDE and that of the GST-EGFP mutant fused protein were measured through Western blotting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The anti-VDE and anti-GFP antibodies specifically reacted with the excised 50-kDa intein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) and the 53-kDa GST-EGFP mutant fused protein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). respectively. All components of about 100 kDa of the unspliced precursor were analyzed using these antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The GST-EGFP mutant fused protein was further identified by OST-affinity chromatography. The crude extract was passed through an affinity column, and the proteins bound to the resin were extracted using Precision protease and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). This gave a 25-kDa band, which was almost the same as the molecular weight of the EGFP mutant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> (3) Next, the affinity column-purified protein was subjected to fluorescent spectrometry, for which the excitation and emission peaks appeared at 488 nm and 510 nm, respectively. The data well corresponded to those of EGFP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The above results indicated that the VDE in the center of the single polypeptide was excised by splicing, causing ligation of the N-and C-terminal polypeptides of the EGFP mutant by peptide bonding, resulting in the correct folding of EGFP mutant to form a fluorophore. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (1) Cells of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>BL21(DE3)pLysS were incubated to produce a recombinant fused protein labeled with His at its N-terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In order to test Protein-protein interaction, GST of pGEX-NVC was substituted with His-label of a pET16-b vector, and its splicing functional site was split to obtain pET-NVC&Dgr;SD(/). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The splitting was realized by substituting the nonfunctional endonuclease motif that exists in the 185th to 389th amino acid region of the mutant with a cassette of ((translation termination codon)&mdash;(Shine-Dalgarno sequence)&mdash;(tranalation initiation codon)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The resulting plasmid pET-NVC&Dgr;SD(/) was a two-gene opera essentially composed of gene 1 that encodes the N-terminal polypeptide of EGFP and VDE (N-EGFP-VDE) and gene 2 that encodes the C-terminal polypeptide of VDE and EGFP (C-VDE-EGFP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> For the N- and C-terminal polypeptides of VDE to be near each other in space during protein-protein interaction, a foldable peptide linker having repetitive Gly-Asn sequences was intoroduced between the translation termination codon and the translation initiation codon (pet-NVC&Dgr;SD linker (/)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In order to confirm whether specific protein-protein interaction that facilitates the splicing to give EGFP in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>occurs, calmodulin (CaM) and its target peptide M13 were selected as model proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The structure of CaM and that of M13 have been clarified through NMR (Ikura, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>1992, 256. 632-638); therefore, CaM and M13 are suitable because the distance between any amino acid in CaM and any amino acid in M13 is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> (2) The recombinant plasmida pET-NVC&Dgr;SD (C/M) , PET-NVC&Dgr;SD linker (C/M) and pET-NVC&Dgr;SD linker (/) were introduced into the cells of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>to obtain the corresponding fused protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> For intracellular splicing, the protein expression was effected at 25&deg; C. for 12 hours; the cells were stored at 4&deg; C. for 1 or 2 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Gene 1 protein expression was confirmed by an anti-His labeled antibody (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). The major components analyzed by the antibody were proteins of 55 kDa (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> <highlight><italic>a, d</italic></highlight>). and their size is on the same level as that of the unspliced N-EGFP-VDE precursor (36 kDa) with CAM (17 kDa) or its linker (1 kDa). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As the control, a lysate of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>having a pET-NVC&Dgr;SD linker (/) plasmida subjected to SDB-PAGE, which gave a single band for N-EGFP-VDE (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A, </cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The expression level of the unspliced precursor proteins obtained from these three plasmids was almost the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the gene 2 protein product was identified by an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, and was found to be the C-terminal polypetide of EGFP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the cell that expressed pET-NVC&Dgr;SD(C/M) and pET-NVC&Dgr;SD linker (C/M), the size of the expression protein obtained from the gene opera well corresponded with that of the precursor protein of N-VDE-EGFP (20 kDa) with M13 (3 kDa) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B, </cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) or the linker-containing M13 (4 kDa) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B, </cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). similarly, the control plasmid expressed the expected protein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B, </cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>).

From the cello of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>carrying pET-NVC&Dgr;SD(C/M) and having co-expressed CaM and M13, a slight change in fluorescence emission at 510 nm was observed. On the to hand, from the cells of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>carrying N-EGFP-VDE and C-VDE-EGFP with a peptide linker therebetween and having co-expressed CaM and M13, a significant change in the fluorescence emission was observed at 510 nm. The fluorescence intensity of the under product from the cells of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>that carries pET-NVC&Dgr;SD linker (C/M) was enough to differentiate those cells from the cells that carry the control plasmid, pET-NC&Dgr;SD linker (/) or the plasmid not encoding the foldable linker pET-NVC&Dgr;SD linker (C/M). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> These results indicate that the CaM-M13 interaction resulted in in-trans splicing, thereby inducing the ligation of the two external regions of N- and C-terminal polypeptides of the EGFP mutant to form the EGFP fluorophore. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> However, the plasmid pET-NVC&Dgr;SD linker (C/M) actually increased the fluorconce intensity at 510 nm significantly. This result confirms that the 10- and 9-amino acid linkers each linked to the N- and C-VDEs enabled the necessary fold ability of VDE and realized good confirmation for effective VDE splicing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (1) This experiment was performed to confirm whether probe &lt;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> &gt; constructed in Example 5 is effective for luciferase splicing, using an oligopeptide (Y941) that contains the 941st tyrosine residue of IRS-1 (which is known to participate in insulin signal transduction) and its target protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-derived SH2N domain (White, M. F., Dlabecologla 1997, 40, S2-S17). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A plasmid pIRES-DSL (Y/S) with Y941 inserted into MCS-A and SH2N into MCS-B, and a PRL-TK vector were transiently coexpressed in CHO-HIR cells. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> First, in a 6-well plate, CHO-HIR cells were transferred with 2 &mgr;g of the plasimid pIRES-DSL (Y/S) or 0.02 ng of the control plasmid pRL-TK. The cells were incubated for 45 hours, and then the culture was outfitted with an FBS-free solution of 1.0&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7 </superscript></highlight>M human insulin; the CHO-HIR cells were excited through incubation (at 37&deg;) for 72 hours, 3 hours or 5 minutes. The cells incubated for 5 minutes were further incubated for 175 minutes in an FCS-free culture with no insulin therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shown the relative emission intensity, RLU, of the insulin-excited cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The corrected luciferase activity of the CHO-HIR cells excited with insulin for 72 hours, 3 hours and 5 minutes were 1.0. 0.73, and 0.118, respectively. The relative emission intensity (against background) of the cells incubated in the insulin-free culture was 0.15, and this is nearly the same as that of the cells excited with insulin for 5 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is understood that the relative emission intensity, RLU of the cells excited with insulin for 3 hours or longer is more than 4 times that of the background. The kinase activity of the cells tested herein results from the specific interaction between the Peptide Y941 (the 941 amino acid of which is tyrosine) phosphorylated with an insulin receptor, and SH2N. This enabled the efficient in-trans folding and splicing of DnaE in probe &lt;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&gt; , there by causing the ligation of LucN and LucC to realize luciferase emission reproduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Next, an Y941 mutant (wherein the tyrosine residue in Y941 was substituted with an alanine residue that is not phosphorylated with the insulin receptor) was constructed, and tested in the same manner as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The corrected luciferase emission of the Y941 mutant-expressing CHO-HIR cells was on the same level as that of the background data. This confirms that the tyrosine phosphorylation in Y941 led to the protein-protein interaction between Y941 and SH2N. </paragraph>
