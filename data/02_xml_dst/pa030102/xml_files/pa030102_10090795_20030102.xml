<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Conventional telephone systems can provide a caller&apos;s status information, but do so in a costly manner that requires significant user time. For example, the office based PBX telephone system provides a caller with status information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Determining whether the party&apos;s line is busy or available requires a caller&apos;s telephone to poll a central station and wait for a call back to receive status information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> At present, the telephone industry is in the process of switching to digital technology (i.e., Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), and Asymmetric Digital Loop (ASDL)). ISDN is an international communications standard for sending voice and data over telephone lines. ISDN technology transmits data at a rate far faster than prior telephone connection technologies. ISDN lines generally include three channels, two bearer (B) channels and one data (D) channel. Each B channel carries voice and data at a bandwidth of 64 kbps (thousands of bits per second), and the D channel handles signal control information. ISDN&apos;s two B channels enable the caller to simultaneously receive and send information. Currently, digitally enabled telephones are being produced.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The telephone disclosed in various embodiments of the present invention may be configured in accordance with a &ldquo;plug-and-play&rdquo; protocol. The user of the telephone simply plugs the telephone into a telephone jack. The telephone automatically connects to the central server, receives TCP/IP information from the server for future communications and registers the client. The client then selects the parties that the client wishes to monitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The client may select parties to monitor by programming the parties&apos; telephone numbers into the client&apos;s local telephone or by a directory lookup by name. The client&apos;s telephone communicates these telephone numbers to the central server and the central server verifies that the parties agree to be monitored. Once the parties agree, the parties register with the system. The client may also select parties to monitor by contacting the service associated with the central server off-line and submitting a request to monitor the specified parties. The central service may verify the agreement of the parties to be monitored by contacting them off-line (e.g., via telephone call, postal mail, e-mail). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the process to select parties to monitor may be initiated by the monitored party. The party to be monitored submits a request to the central server. In return, the central server remotely programs the monitoring party&apos;s telephone with the monitored party&apos;s status and identification information. It will be appreciated that the monitoring party may locally program its telephone. If the monitored party requests a monitoring party that is currently not a client to the status monitoring service, the service contacts the monitoring party off-line to determine if this party wishes to become a client to the service to receive status updates from the monitored party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> schematic diagram of the digital phone monitoring system of an embodiment of the present invention may be generally appreciated. It will be appreciated that an embodiment of the present invention defines a first telephone as a monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and defines a second telephone as a monitoring telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In particular, communication links between three monitoring client telephones <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and three monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Whenever a change in status of a monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> occurs, monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> communicates the status change via central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to each monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> registered to receive status updates of that monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the number of monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> were arbitrarily chosen, and that alternative embodiments of the present invention may include any number of monitored and any number of monitoring client telephones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill in the art will understand the benefits of receiving the status of another telephone. For example, teenagers may monitor their friends to determine which of their friends&apos; phone lines are busy. When a teenager wants to call a friend, prior to even picking up and dialing the phone, the teenager automatically knows which friends are available to talk. The teenager may be presented with a list of friends, so that the teenager can instantly see which ones are available. In another example, a mother may want to monitor her home telephone while at work. The mother may be interested in determining whether the phone is busy, or may wish to monitor the amount of time that her son, daughter or babysitter is on the phone per day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that status information may be input at monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. For example, when a child arrives home, the child may enter a DTMF code into monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (e.g., *68). The code representing a status update is sent to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> forwards the status information to the child&apos;s mother&apos;s monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, thereby informing the mother that her child has arrived at home. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In another example, a supervisor may monitor when a telecommuting employee or consultant is working. For instance, the employee or consultant enters a predetermined code into monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> when arriving at work. Monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> sends the code to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> searches a DTMF code database <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, retrieving the status corresponding to the code. Once retrieved, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> sends the status to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The status allows the supervisor to know when to contact the employee or consultant. Alternatively, this embodiment of the invention may provide the supervisor with additional information. For example, accounting and billing processes may calculate the total number of hours the employee worked. The status may also affect the billing rate for the called party. For example, calling a consultant while her status is &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; may result in a higher charge (e.g., a higher hourly billing rate) for that caked time. A billing program may obtain such information as total time with a certain status (e.g., a status of &ldquo;working&rdquo;) and/or the total time on the phone with a particular status (e.g., &ldquo;lunchtime&rdquo;) and/or the applicable billing rate or other fee structure. Such a billing program could then generate an appropriate bill based thereon, and output a bill in printed, electronic file, email, fax or other forms. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these examples are provided purely for illustrative purposes and should not be understood to limit the breadth of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Status information may also be automatically determined by client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a monitoring client telephone, or any combination of the foregoing whether cooperating or not. For example, the location or approximate location of a phone (e.g., a cellular phone with GPS capability, cellular phones with other location abilities, calculating the Doppler effect of a signal received from a cellular phone) may be ascertained by the central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> by, e.g., receiving a signal from the cellular phone that indicates the location or approximate location of the cell phone. Alternatively, the phone may broadcast a signal, which is received by a receiver. The strength and / or time of reception of the signal may allow the central server to determine the distance of the phone from the receiver. The mere fact that a signal is received may also indicate the location of the phone. In certain embodiment, a low strength receiver that receives a signal, or a receiver that receives a signal from a low power transmitter, may indicate that the transmitter is within a certain area. For example, a base unit may be equipped to receive a signal from a handset unit only if the handset is within one hundred feet of the base. In another example, a base unit may readily determine when the handset is physically plugged into the base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is additionally possible to use a plurality of such receivers to more accurately determine the location of the phone through known locating techniques, including but not limited to triangulation. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> diagram of a Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> connected to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be generally appreciated. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily contemplate, based on the present disclosure, other interfaces besides the specific TAPI illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of communication applications <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> such as a call control application <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, an interactive voice application <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a voice mail application <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, a call center application <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and a TCP/IP conferencing application <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> also includes a registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, a notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, an encryption/decryption service <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, a queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, a start-up/self test service <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, a monitoring service <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, a TCP/IP database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, a client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, a digital signature <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, a call accounting service <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> and a DTMF code database <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. A TAPI interface <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> connects each of the above components to TAPI <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. A detailed description of the services, managers, and databases in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> will be provided below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown, TAPI <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> enables applications to access all the telephony options available on any machine. For example, the communication applications <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> including call control application <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, interactive voice application <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, voice mail application <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, call center application <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and TCP/IP conferencing application <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may access all telephony options available on monitoring telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. For instance, the applications may access monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> stored on monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The data on a call is available to applications in a standard manner. TAPI <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is an architecture that provides simple and generic methods for making connections between two or more machines and provides each machine access to any media stream involved in that connection. TAPI <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> abstracts call-control functionality to provide a common interface to applications that utilize different and seemingly incompatible communication protocols. This interface connects monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> diagram of a client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of an embodiment of the present invention may be better appreciated. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may comprise either a monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> or a monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be implemented as one or more separate devices. For example, client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be a single device or comprise a combination such as a telephone in communication with a separate sensor input device which is itself in communication with a separate transmitter device. Many more variations are contemplated by the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> operates under a multi-tasking, multithreaded operating system platform (e.g., UNIX, or WINDOWS NT by MICROSOFT of Redmond, Wash.). As shown, client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a display device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, an input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, a processor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and a data storage device <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. Processor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is connected to a communication port <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> (e.g., network interface). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise a keyboard comprising a plurality of DTMF coded buttons. Alternatively or in addition, input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise a means for receiving other types of input. For example, input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise a GPS receiver for receiving information from a global positioning system. Such a GPS receiver typically receives broadcast signals that allow it to determine latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. Similarly, input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise a receiver that receives various wireless signals such as radio signals or infrared signals. Such receivers may be capable of receiving signals transmitted by cell phones, appliance remote controls such a s television remote controls, remote car lock actuators, remote garage door openers, PDAs, and other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise sensors or detectors that detect stimulus such as motion sensors (whether based on Doppler effects or other types of motion sensors), sensors that measure movement or actuation of a door or garage door; electrical sensors that detect activation or deactivation of air conditioners, lights and other devices; general electrical sensors that detect power consumption; weight sensors; temperature sensors; and combinations and equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise means for detecting the powering up or activation of the client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. For example, the input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise a detector in communication with a circuit that activates or powers up a device, component of a device or plurality of components of a device. Accordingly, input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise means for detecting the powering up or activation of (i) a telephone, such as a desktop phone, cellular phone or wireless phone; (ii) a computer; or (iii) a television. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> may comprise a microphone or other audio reception device, possibly but not necessarily separate from the conventional microphone of a telephone for receiving spoken sounds. Such a microphone can be operational to detect, process and / or transmit sound even if the phone is in an inactive state, such as when it is not in use or when a receiver is cradled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Display device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is an LCD or other type of display that shows the status of each party being monitored by client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the data stored in monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. For example, the display shows a name and the current status of each party being monitored. It will be appreciated that client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> might not include display device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Communications port <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> provides the network interface to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> using TCP/IP over the D channel on an ISDN telephone line. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the telecommunication specifications are provided purely for illustrative purposes and that alternative embodiments of this invention may include different telecommunication methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Data storage device <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> includes a monitoring service <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> that processor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> executes to provide client digital phone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> with monitoring functionality. Data storage device <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> also includes a startup/self-test service <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, display manager <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, digital signature <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, encryption/decryption service <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, call accounting service <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, a TAPI interface <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, a communications applications <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, a registration service <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, a queue manager <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>, a DTMF code database <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, and a notification service <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The communications applications <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, the registration service <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, the queue manager <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>, the DTMF code database <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, and the notification service <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> are utilized by the client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in ways similar to those of the corresponding elements of the central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Startup/self-test service <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, at startup, tests all hardware of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and loads the operating system and services. If connected via TAPI interface <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, startup occurs when client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is powered on. A startup may also occur if a user presses a re-boot key (not shown) located on client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Startup/self-test process <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> typically includes three types of tests. It performs a checksum on EPROM, checks the ISDN line to confirm that the link with central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> on D and both B channels is up and running, and confirms that a &ldquo;service provider identification&rdquo; (SPID) matches the SPID pre-programmed on client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. A SPID is typically composed of the telephone number of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> followed by four additional digits. It will be appreciated that central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> assigns client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> TCP/IP information during the initial connection between client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> subsequently stores that information. It will also be appreciated that, at startup, client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> sends its TCP/IP information to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> verifies that the TCP/IP information matches the assigned TCP/IP information of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that in addition to ISDN, startup/self-test service <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be applied to other types of communication technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> If client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is a monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, after startup/self-test service <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is executed by processor <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> requests that central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> send status updates of the monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that it is authorized to receive. Monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> seizes the D channel of the ISDN line and sends its DTMF codes. Central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> reads the registration information and routes the call to registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> via a communications (e.g., a DS-1 or DS-3) line. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the demand for communication lines at the time central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> transmits the code information determines which line is chosen. Registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> senses the incoming call and causes central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to go off-hook on that line. Once off-hook, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> opens a communication link between central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Once monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> senses that the D channel communication link with central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is established, it builds and encrypts an acknowledgment message with its SPID and a digital signature. Encryption/decryption service <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> uses the public key of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to encrypt a message and generate a digital signature bundled with the message. Encryption/decryption service <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> uses the private key of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to decrypt the message and validate the signature. The digital signature provides the security clearance of monitoring client telephone&apos;s <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> identity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If encryption/decryption service <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> successfully decrypts the message and verifies the digital signature of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> sends an acknowledgment (ACK) message and its digital signature back to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. If the verification fails, server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> instead sends a no-acknowledgment (NAK) and its digital signature back to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and drops the line. If monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> receives an ACK, it verifies the digital signature of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. If the verification is a success, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> returns an ACK message to server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. If the verification fails, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> returns a NAK message to server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and drops the line. If the communications between central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> resulted in ACKs, a session is established between monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> queries client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to confirm that the account of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is in good standing. Although not shown, a preferred embodiment of client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> may include client billing and account information. It will be appreciated that the telephone company will typically provide the status monitoring service only to clients that have paid their telephone bills. Registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> then sends a clear to send (CTS) message to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> that it is ready and waiting. Monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> receives the message and creates and sends a monitor message (MM) to registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> receives the message and queries client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to obtain the current status of the monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is authorized to receive. Alternatively, the message from monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may include a request for a status update of specific monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> After entering the appropriate status information into a message, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> uses the public key of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to encrypt the message, and return the message. Monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> receives the message and decrypts it with its private key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> then updates monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and outputs the status of each party. Monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> then sends a message to registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> acknowledging successful receipt of the status updates. Call accounting service <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> updates client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to bill for the successful inquiry and drops the session by clearing the channel. Monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> recognizes that the channel is down and enters into a wait state until notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> sends it updated status information. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that once monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> restarts and resets with status updates of monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> begins to automatically receive status updates without the need to poll central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> includes monitoring information stored on storage device <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> for an exemplary view of monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. As shown, the monitoring information includes monitored client SPID <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, monitored client name <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and status <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> of the monitored client. It will be appreciated that alternative embodiments of this invention may include other varied types of monitoring information. For example, monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> may also include information such as total number of hours a monitored phone is busy, or total number of hours that a monitored telephone of an employee had an associated status of &ldquo;working&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Display manager <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> accesses monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, and displays this information on display device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (if display is the method of outputting status). Display manager <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> may also display messages originating from central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. For example, display manager <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> may receive and display messages from central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> during registration of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Digital signature <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> provides client digital telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> with the ability to verify the identity of a sender of TCP/IP message packets by creating and utilizing private and public keys. Digital signature <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is included with encrypted messages sent between client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. At client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the recipient&apos;s public key is used to encrypt a message and generate a digital signature string that is bundled therein. Upon receipt of the message, the recipient, such as central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or another client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, uses its private key to decrypt the message and validate the signature. Validating the signature verifies the message sender&apos;s identity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Call accounting service <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> on client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> maintains up-to-date billing information. For example, call accounting service <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> sends telephone usage and billing updates to client&apos;s telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and stores the updates on storage device <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. In response to a subscriber&apos;s request, display manager <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> accesses and displays the information on display device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, in an embodiment of this invention, routinely initiates the transmission of accounting information to call accounting service <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. In still another embodiment, call accounting central service <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> retrieves telephone usage and billing updates from central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in response to a request from the subscriber of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. A phone <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is in communication via wire or wireless medium with a peripheral <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, which is in turn in communication via wire or wireless medium with a display <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. Display <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> may comprise any device for presenting information visually, such as an LCD (liquid crystal display), monitor, or similar device. The functionality of the embodiments of the present invention may be distributed among the phone <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, peripheral <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> and display <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> in an appropriate manner as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, peripheral <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> may comprise a computer or similar computing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A communication device <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> permits the phone <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> to transmit and receive signals. Communication device <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> may comprise means for transmitting and receiving data over a cable, wire or similar medium, as might be appropriate for a desktop phone. Alternatively, communication device <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> may comprise means for transmitting and receiving data wirelessly via infrared, radio or similar signals, as might be appropriate for a cellular phone or other wireless device. In one embodiment, peripheral <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> and display <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> may compose an integral unit which is adapted to be connected to phone <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. For example, an integral unit may comprise a single casing which encloses therein the peripheral <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> and the display <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, while the casing defines an opening allowing a portion on the viewable area of the display to be seen outside the casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Such an integral unit, or at least one of the individual peripheral and display, may be fitted to the phone <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and detachably held thereto by the shape of the integral unit relative to the phone <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, fitting to the phone detachably holding thereto may be accomplished by a fixing means such as a snap or similar means. Physical contact need not be required for communication between the phone <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and the peripheral <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> diagram of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. Central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> operates under a multi-tasking, multithreaded operating system platform (e.g., UNIX, or WINDOWS NT by MICROSOFT of Redmond, Wash.). As shown, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> includes an input device <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> (e.g., CD ROM or floppy disk drive, keyboard), processor <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> connected to a communications port <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, and a storage device <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. Communications port <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> provides a network interface, using TCP/IP over the D channel on an ISDN telephone line to connect central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the telecommunication specifications are provided purely for illustrative purposes, and that alternative embodiments of this invention may include different types of telecommunication methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Storage device <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> includes monitoring service <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, TAPI interface <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, encryption/decryption service <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, start-up/self-test service <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, TCP/IP information database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, communication applications <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, call accounting service <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>, digital signature <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and DTMF code database <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Monitoring service <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> provides central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> with a monitoring process in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. TAPI interface <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, as discussed above, enables applications, such as monitoring service <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, to access all the telephony options available on any client telephone. For example, it provides monitoring service <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> with access to updated monitored client database <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> stored on client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Encryption/decryption service <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> employs private and public keys to respectively decrypt and encrypt messages that are sent to client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. This process also employs a digital signature <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> to verify the message sender&apos;s identity. Central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> receives a digital string encrypted with a message from client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Upon receipt of the message, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> uses its private key to decrypt the message and validate digital signature <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. Similarly, when central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> sends a message to client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> utilizes the public key of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to encrypt the message and generate a digital signature string that is bundled therein. Client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> uses its private key to decrypt the message and validate the server&apos;s identity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Startup/self-test service <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> initializes all components at startup and checks predetermined parameters when booting up. Tests include confirming that the ISDN line over D and both B channels that connect central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and client telephones <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is operating within predetermined parameters, and verifying that incoming messages to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are originated from authorized SPIDs. For example, at startup, startup/self-test service <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> sends a SPID verification message to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Startup/self-test service <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> verifies that the SPID is authorized to receive monitoring information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> registers monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and monitoring client telephones <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and maintains a list of current accounts and a list of the active connections between subscribers. Registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> stores the list of current accounts on client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and stores the list of active connections on TCP/IP information database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an example of client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an example of TCP/IP information database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If the status of monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> changes, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> receives a status information update. Notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> notifies queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to transmit the status update to the appropriate monitoring client telephones <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> receives notification of the status change from notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, queries client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> for the appropriate SPID(s) to contact, and transmits an indication of the change in status to the authorized clients designated by the appropriate SPID(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Call accounting service <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> maintains and sends billing information in real time to each client. More particularly, call accounting service <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> sends accounting and billing information in update packets to the client&apos;s telephone either (i) periodically (e.g., daily), or (2) in response to a client request. Accordingly, a client can always view in real time the specific charges associated with a call or view the running total for monthly bill. It will be appreciated that call accounting service <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> employed by client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> provides a subscriber with numerous functions for viewing and processing specific charges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> diagram of an exemplary monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> stored within monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. As shown, each entry of monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> specifies a monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that is assigned to send status information to a monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> includes, for each party being monitored, a monitored client SPID <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, a monitored client name <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and the current status <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> of monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that for a given monitored client SPID <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may monitor more than one status. For example, the last entry <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight> of monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> includes more than one status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A number of methods are available to enter data into monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. For example, in one method, a client using input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> locally inputs monitored client SPIDs <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, and corresponding monitored client names <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> into monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. In an alternative method, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, in response to a request from monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, remotely updates the SPIDs of monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A client requests status monitoring by either calling a telephone company&apos;s toll-free number to verbally request monitoring, or by electronically submitting a request via an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) unit. It will be appreciated that a Voice Response Unit (VRU) may also be used. However, before monitoring of a particular SPID occurs, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> must receive permission from the party at monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The central telephone office requests permission by electronically sending a request via central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, or by contacting the party using another method. Other methods may include, for example, a telephone call, an e-mail, or a letter. If central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> receives permission, it sends an authorizing signal to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Once authorized, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> receives status updates from central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and enters the updates into monitored party database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. Display device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of the monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> displays each status update <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may initiate the request to be monitored by monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. When central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> electronically receives the request, or the central telephone service receives the request using another manner, the service requests permission to send monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> status updates of monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the request for permission may be electronically submitted by central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or provided using another manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that a subscriber at monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> may monitor a status change of a particular predetermined condition. For example, a subscriber may choose to monitor the &ldquo;busy&rdquo; status of monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a subscriber may choose to monitor when the person at monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> enters a DTMF code indicative of a working status. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that these examples are purely illustrative of different status changes, and that alternative embodiments of the present invention may include status changes of other predetermined conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(A), a diagram of an exemplary client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> stored on central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. As shown, this database includes entries for each monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that is registered with central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Each entry includes the party being monitored, identifiable by monitored client SPID <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, the party receiving the status updates, identifiable by monitoring client SPID <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, and the particular status changes monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will receive, shown as monitored status <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and a current status <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the current status <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> of an entry of client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> may include more than one status. The process of updating and maintaining client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> will be discussed in conjunction with the description of the registration process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(B), a diagram of exemplary DTMF code database <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> stored at central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. As shown, this database includes a status <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> assigned to each DTMF code <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>. Notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> uses DTMF code database <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to translate incoming DTMF codes to an appropriate status. It will be appreciated that a DTMF code may represent information other than a status. For example, a DTMF code may represent a request for billing information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> diagram of exemplary TCP/IP information database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> stored at central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. As shown, this database includes entries for each client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> registered with central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Each entry includes a SPID address <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and a corresponding TCP/IP address <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. A TCP/IP address information <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> is issued to each client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> registered with central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> communicates with other nodes and clients based on their assigned TCP/IP address <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the header portion of messages sent between monitored and monitoring client telephones <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> typically include a TCP/IP address <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. When receiving or sending a message, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> uses the SPID address <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> listed in the TCP/IP database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> to verify that the TCP/IP address included within the message&apos;s header portion is correct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>., a flowchart of a status monitoring process <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> may be generally appreciated. As shown, in step <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> registers the subscriber of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, the subscriber of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> selects the parties the subscriber wishes to monitor. In step <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> registers the parties to be monitored. It will be appreciated that prior to registering these parties, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may request each party&apos;s permission to be monitored by the subscriber of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> receives TCP/IP packets from monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> transmits the TCP/IP packets to the monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> configured to receive the status updates. Once received, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> displays the status to the subscriber. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the general steps of an embodiment of the present invention, and that FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> described below will explain each step in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that in alternative embodiments of the present invention, monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may register prior to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may select the parties that it wishes to provide status updates. Prior to sending the status updates, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> must register and provide central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the central telephone permission to receive the status information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When a party at a client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> wishes to register as a subscriber of a monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, or as a monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> seizes the D channel of the ISDN line and sends the registration information to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of a telephone station&apos;s central office. Central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> reads the registration information and routes the call to registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> via a DS-1 or DS-3 line. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the demand for communication lines at the time central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> transmits the code information determines which line is chosen. Registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> senses the incoming call and central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> goes off-hook on that line. Once off-hook, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> opens a communication link between central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the party wishing to register. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The request for a party&apos;s permission to be monitored by the subscriber may be accomplished in a variety of ways. The party may affirmatively register his willingness to be monitored, whether or not a request for permission has been directed to him. Accordingly, a subscriber need not select parties to monitor&mdash;the parties may indicate that they are to be monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> For example, the party may enter an indication of one or more subscribers that are authorized to monitor the party. Such an indication may be entered via a phone, for example, by actuating numeric keys (e.g., on input device <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>) to indicate the phone number of such authorized subscribers. Such an indication may also be entered via a phone, for example, by communicating with a VRU (Voice Response Unit). Such a method of entry could be performed via any public or private phone, whether or not the that phone had other capabilities described herein. An indication of one or more subscribers that are authorized to monitor the party may be entered via a computer communicating with a web site, which in turn provides the information to, e.g., central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The indication of subscribers that are authorized to monitor the party may be made automatically without much or any input from the party. For example, the party may set or accept a threshold such that people the party calls (or people that call the party) more than the threshold are authorized to monitor the party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Many other methods of entry, and many other types of devices used in such entry, will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A list of one or more subscribers that are authorized to monitor the party may be stored locally on the party&apos;s phone or other device and / or stored remotely on central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Various parties may be authorized to monitor only certain kinds of statuses of a particular monitored party. For example, a first group may be authorized to monitor all statuses of a particular party, while a second group may be authorized to monitor only certain statuses of that party. In another embodiment, various parties may be able to attain different levels of access by paying. For example, telemarketers and other businesses may be able to pay to ascertain certain statuses of a party. The status of a monitored party may be employed as a &ldquo;block&rdquo; against certain calls. In certain embodiments, it is not necessary for a monitoring party to register at all. The block applies to certain callers or all callers, irrespective of whether any party registered in any way to receive status. In one embodiment, a status may simply indicate that no calls are allowed to get through to the monitored party (i.e. all calls blocked). In another embodiment, a status may indicate that only certain people are blocked, or that only certain people are unblocked (i.e. may call). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, certain parties may be allowed to always get through a block. For example, it may be desirable for the monitored party to always permit a spouse and parent to circumvent a block. In always granting such parties access, their phones could be always granted access to the monitored party (e.g., by receiving an identifying signal (e.g., ANI, SPID) from such phone and comparing that signal with a list of authorized phones), or those parties could be provided with special access codes. Upon calling the monitored party when a block is in effect, the party would enter the access code and be granted access by allowing there call to get through. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A monitoring party that attempts to call the monitored party but is &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; may, e.g., receive a busy signal, receive a particular kind of busy signal, or receive a particular audio message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Certain locations or certain times may be marked as &ldquo;blocked&rdquo;, thereby preventing some or all calls from going through. For example, from a phone which has a location that may be determined, a party may enter a code that indicates the current location as a &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; location or a location where a certain status is to be established. For example, a party may enter an office building and enter a code via a wireless phone. This could establish a status of &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; while the party is in the building. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The location of the phone upon entry of the code may be determined, such that, e.g., that location alone is an area in which the status would be established as &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;. Optionally, a radius may be set such that when the phone is within the radius of that location the status would be established as &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;. Such a radius may be predetermined, or alterable (e.g., by the party). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As described herein, once the status changes, for example, if a party moves out of an office building previously marked as having a status of &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;, an email, message or other transmission may be automatically sent to monitoring parties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a group of certain parties may be established, and a member of the group may determine who in the group is calling another, and who is free. The identity of those called by other group members may or may not be made available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, establishing such a group can allow a member of the group to sort a list of the other members in order of, e.g., frequency of calls to the parties, frequency of calls from the parties, frequency of calls to or from the parties and / or frequency of calls from the parties to any member of the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, it can be advantageous to rate members of the group based on, e.g., calls with others, calls to other customers on the phone network provider (e.g., Verizon) or calls with other members of the group. The rating may be based on, e.g., number of such calls, duration of such calls. A rating according to this embodiment may confer rewards such as discounted or free products, discounted or free services from the phone network provider. The rank may be displayed or otherwise made known to member of the group, conferring psychological rewards or penalties upon members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a group of members may eavesdrop on other members who are communicating with one another via, e.g., voice, text messaging. Such eavesdropping may be automatically allowed, or may require permission from those engaged in communicating. It may also be advantageous to allow members of the group to access a &ldquo;log&rdquo; of prior communication (e.g., recorded voice, recorded text messages) to allow eavesdropper to catch up on what had been communicating prior to eavesdropping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the registration process performed by registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. In step <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> receives a request from a registering client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> for a TCP/IP address and a security clearance. The security clearance process utilizes a digital signature and encryption to secure the messages sent between client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. More particularly, once client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> senses that the D channel communication link with central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is established, it builds and encrypts an acknowledgment message with its SPID and a digital signature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Client Telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> uses a public key of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to encrypt a message and generate a digital signature bundled with the message. The recipient of the message uses its private key to decrypt the message and validate the signature. The digital signature provides the security clearance of the message sender&apos;s identity. It will be appreciated that all communications between central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and client telephone are encrypted and include a digital signature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> At registration, if encryption/decryption service <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> decrypts the message and verifies the digital signature of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> sends an acknowledgment (ACK) message and its digital signature back to client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. If the verification fails, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> instead sends a no-acknowledgment (NAK) and its digital signature back to client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and drops the line. If client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> receives an ACK, it verifies the digital signature of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. If the verification is a success, client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> returns an ACK message to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. If the verification fails, client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> returns a NAK message to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and drops the line. If these communications resulted in ACKs, a session is established between client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> receives a SPID/MAC (Media Access Control Layer) address from registering client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the SPID/MAC was either pre-programmed into registering client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> or was previously assigned by central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> checks the SPID/MAC format. In step <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>, if the format is incorrect, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> sends an &ldquo;unable to process request&rdquo; message to client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. If the format is correct, in step <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> issues client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> a TCP/IP address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> stores the SPID of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> into the appropriate field of client database <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. If client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is a monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> stores the SPID as a monitored client SPID <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. If client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is a monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> stores the SPID as a monitoring client SPID <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> stores the SPID address and the corresponding TCP/IP address in TCP/IP address database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. Once client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and TCP/IP address database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> are updated, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> sends a registration acknowledgment message back to client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> indicating that it is now registered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> After client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> registers as a monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, the subscriber of client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> selects one or more parties that the subscriber wishes to monitor. At monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the subscriber may enter each parties&apos; phone number into monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, where each parties phone number is mapped to a SPID. Once entered, monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> sends these telephone numbers to registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the subscriber may also select parties to monitor by contacting the service associated with registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> off-line, and submitting a request to monitor the specified parties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Once registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> receives the request to monitor one or more parties, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> verifies that the parties agree to be monitored. If a party is a current subscriber of the status monitoring service, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may electronically send the permission request directly to that party&apos;s client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if a party is not a current subscriber, the central service may verify that the party agrees to be monitored by contacting that person off-line (e.g., via telephone call, postal mail, e-mail). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> If the party agrees to be monitored by the subscriber of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> registers the monitored party which the subscriber selected. It will be appreciated that if the party agrees to be monitored and does not currently included as an entry within the TCP/IP information database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> registers this party by performing the steps of the registration process described above and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. For all monitored parties, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> updates client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> with each party&apos;s monitored client SPID <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> , the status <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> being monitored, and the monitoring client SPID <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> of the subscriber who will receive the status updates of the monitored client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Once client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and TCP/IP information database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> includes the appropriate identifiers assigned to each new party to be monitored, registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> sends an indication to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> that the parties agreed to be monitored and are registered at central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that a number of methods exist to update monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> with the SPIDs of the parties that will be monitored. For example, in one method, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, in response to a request from monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, remotely updates monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> with the SPIDs <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> and the corresponding monitored client names <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. In an alternative method, the subscriber locally inputs monitored client SPIDs <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, and corresponding monitored client names <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> into monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> notification process <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> performed by notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. Once registration service <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> registers the monitoring and monitored parties, monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> automatically sends status updates via central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to the subscriber of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> sends each status update in a TCP/IP packet when its status changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the status change may be a DTMF code entered by the monitored party into monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. For example, a party when working may enter a DTMF code. It will also be appreciated that when a first monitored party initiates a call to a second monitored party, monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the first monitored party will submit status updates of both parties to central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the status update may show that the first monitored party is electronically connected to the second monitored party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Prior to sending a packet of status updates, monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> uses a public key of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to encrypt and provide a digital signature within the TCP/IP packet. In step <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> receives the encrypted TCP/IP packet from monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Notification <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> service uses the private key to decrypt and verify the packet&apos;s digital signature. Notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> also compares the SPID and TCP/IP address information provider in the header portion of the TCP/IP packet to the appropriate entry in the TCP/IP database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> to verify the source of the status update. Once the source of the update is verified, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> stores the status to current status <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> of the appropriate record(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> queries client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to retrieve a record that includes monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> determines if this record applies to the status update it received. More specifically, it determines if this status update corresponds to the status information that monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is configured to receive. If the status corresponds, in step <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> transmits the TCP/IP packet to queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. If the status does not correspond, in step <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> determines if there is another record corresponding to monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. If there is another record, notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> determines if this record applies to the status update it received from monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that this process continues until notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> reviews all records of client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> that apply to monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Once the review of client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> records is completed, in step <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, notification process <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> queuing process <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> performed by queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. The process begins in step <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> when queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> receives a TCP/IP packet from notification service <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. This packet includes a status update, and an origin and a destination SPID of respective monitored client telephone <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>, queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> retrieves from TCP/IP address database <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> the TCP/IP address of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the destination SPID. In step <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> transmits the TCP/IP packet to the TCP/IP address of the appropriate monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>, if monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> successfully received the TCP/IP packet, queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> receives an acknowledgment of the successful transmission. Queue manager <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> updates client database <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> for billing purposes and drops the session with monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that all communications between central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and each client may be encrypted. For example, the TCP/IP information that monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> receives is encrypted. Monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> uses its private key to decrypt and access the status update provided in the TCP/IP packet. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the communications do not necessarily have to be encrypted. Monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> updates monitored client database <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> with the status update. Display manager <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> displays the status update on display device <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the subscriber of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is capable of monitoring the status of the parties of monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> without even picking up the telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, an embodiment of client digital phone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be better appreciated. As shown, client digital phone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a handset <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, an LCD display <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>, DTMF buttons <highlight><bold>1306</bold></highlight>, extension status indicators <highlight><bold>1308</bold></highlight> and a volume control <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>. The screen of sample LCD display <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> shows the current status of the parties of monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the four parties shown on LCD display <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> are purely illustrative of the status information provided to subscribers, and that any number of parties of monitored client telephones <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be displayed. If the number of monitored parties requires more display space than is available on LCD display <highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>, the status entries may continuously scroll. Alternatively, client telephone <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may include scrolling buttons, that allow a subscriber to scroll though pages of client digital phones <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that are being monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that an alternative embodiment of the present invention may utilize the Internet and other networks to transfer status information of a pre-selected list of frequently called telephone numbers from central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of the central service to the party of monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> receives status information as described above, but instead of sending the information to monitoring client telephone <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> posts the status information to, e.g., the monitoring party&apos;s web page account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that central server <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may comprise a plurality of devices that are located in numerous geographical regions. Such devices would communicate with each other for the purpose of transmitting status update packets between different geographic regions. Accordingly, each device includes in its client database, records of all monitored and monitoring clients from all regions. When a device is notified of a status change of a monitored party, it transmits the status update packet to the device servicing the region where the monitoring party is located. In one embodiment for the present invention, each local region may include one device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that unique separate servers may support each region by communicating with each other. It will be further appreciated that a single server may support multiple regions or may be distributed across multiple regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A variety of different statuses, and uses of statuses, are consistent with the present disclosure. For example, a status may indicate who the monitored party is communicating with. In one embodiment, the central server could readily determine who the monitored party was communicating with, and make that information available to authorized monitoring parties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A status may indicate who the monitored party is located near. As described herein, the location or approximate location of a phone may be determined. Accordingly, it may be determined which phones are located near the monitored phone. Such a status would be advantageous to, for example, a parent monitoring a child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> A status may indicate the state of the battery of a battery-powered phone. Such a status would be advantageous in allowing a monitoring party to determine whether a call to the monitored party would unduly deplete the battery of the monitored party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A status may indicate the local time of the monitored party. For example, a monitored party may have traveled to a different time zone, and monitoring party can be informed of the local time of the monitored party. Such information would allow a monitoring party to exercise judgment as to whether it would be an appropriate time to call the monitored party. Such a status may also be used by the monitored party to block certain calls, for example, all calls after 11:00 PM of the local time of the monitored party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A status may indicate whether the monitored party is using a text messaging or similar feature of a phone, such as a wireless phone with text messaging or email capability. Such a status may indicate, e.g., whether a monitored party is (i) available for text messaging, (ii) currently entering text, (iii) currently reading text, (iv) scrolling, and/or (v) playing online games or engaging in other online activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A status may indicate whether the monitored party wants top receive calls, or when the monitored party would like to receive calls. Such a capability may be extended only to certain kinds of calls. For example, the monitored party may desire to receive a call from customer service, or a call indicating a desired weather report or news report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the status information may trigger a message sent to the monitoring party. Such a message may be via email, instant messaging, audio or other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Status information need not be displayed, or might be displayed in conjunction with other types of output of status information. For example, status information could be output through the speaker on the phone, another speaker or other audio device. Thus, status may be output as messages such as &ldquo;Bill is working right now&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bill&apos;s is in New York and the local time is midnight&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Bill&apos;s battery is low. Please use your judgment whether you should call him now.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Status information may also be indicated by a busy signal, or a different kind of busy signal than is normally output. Different busy signals may be used for different statuses. The selection of busy signals used for different statuses may be selected by the monitoring party and / or the monitored party. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A status may indicate whether the monitored party is moving, the speed and/or the direction of movement. For example, the location of a car phone or cellular phone may be periodically determined, and thus a changing location can indicate that the monitored party is moving. Additionally, the speed and direction of movement can likewise be easily determined. It may be desirable to &ldquo;block&rdquo; calls when in moving. It may also be desirable to prevent outgoing calls while in motion. Similarly, it may be advantageous to require an override code to be entered into a phone while in motion in order to permit an outgoing call. For example, a state law may prohibit talking on a phone while driving a car. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The particular patterns of status changes may be learned. For example, if a certain location is established as having a status during certain times, or a certain status is periodically established during certain times of the day, these patterns may be learned by appropriate machine learning techniques, as is well understood by those skilled in the art. Thus, the party may be able to avoid manually entering status information and other information if the requisite pattern has been learned. Similarly, once the pattern has been learned, the future status at certain times may be predicted. Messages and other information may be adapted to this prediction. For example, if it is learned that a status of unavailable occurs every work day between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM then a calling party calling at 2:30 PM may be informed that the called party will become available at 3:00 PM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> An additional status may be that the phone has detected a noise, or a noise exceeding a certain decibel level, at any time or while its status was a predetermined status, such as &ldquo;nobody home&rdquo;. Such an embodiment would be advantageous for monitoring a home while it is vacant. Detecting a noise could trigger, e.g., a call to a predetermined number (such as a work number) and could also play back during that call the previous thirty seconds of sound recorded prior to the detected noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Another type of remote monitoring would be to permit information from the phone to be transmitted to another location. For example, a log of calls made to the phone in the last four hours may be transmitted (e.g., via fax, email, over the phone) when a code is received (e.g., via a work phone, via email). Additionally, after receiving such a log, a party could indicate which calls he wanted to return (e.g., upon arriving back home). In one embodiment such calls may be returned without dialing; the order of returned calls could be established when indicating which calls to return, and the calls made by merely picking up the phone </paragraph>
