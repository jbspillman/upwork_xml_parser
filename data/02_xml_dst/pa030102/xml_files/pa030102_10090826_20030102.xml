<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">As a result of comparing an address set in an area setting register and an address shown by address information of an access request signal, if the address set in the area setting register matches the address shown by the address information, a command with auto precharge is outputted to an FCRAM, and if not, an ordinary command is outputted to the FCRAM. Thus, when an area, in which addresses to be accessed are random in many cases, is accessed, the command with auto precharge is outputted to allow the FCRAM to perform a precharge operation automatically, and when an area, in which addresses to be accessed are sequential in many cases, is accessed, the ordinary command is outputted to allow a read operation or a write operation to be performed continuously, whereby data transfer efficiency can be increased. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a control device for a semiconductor memory device and a method of controlling the semiconductor memory device, and the present invention is particularly suitable for a control device for a semiconductor memory device having an auto precharge function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, included among DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memories) is an SDRAM (synchronous DRAM) in which an external interface operates in synchronization with a clock signal with a given cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> are timing diagrams of a read operation in a conventional SDRAM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> is a timing diagram of a read operation when an undermentioned read command with auto precharge is not used, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> is a timing diagram of a read operation when the read command with auto precharge is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> First, the read operation when the read command with auto precharge is not used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> When an active command ACTV including a row address outputted from a control device not shown is supplied to the SDRAM at a time T<highlight><subscript>61</subscript></highlight>, the SDRAM brings a page specified by the row address into an active state. At a time T<highlight><subscript>63 </subscript></highlight>after a lapse of a period of time tRCD (after which a read command READ can be outputted) from the output of the active command ACTV, the read command READ including a column address outputted from the control device is supplied to the SDRAM. At a time T<highlight><subscript>65 </subscript></highlight>after a lapse of a period of time tCL from the output of the read command READ, the SDRAM outputs (reads) data DT stored in an address specified by the column address in the page brought into the active state by the active command ACTV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, for example, when a read operation is performed for a page different from the page brought into the active state (a row address different from the row address included in the active command ACTV outputted at the time T<highlight><subscript>61</subscript></highlight>), the control device supplies a precharge command PRE to the SDRAM at a time T<highlight><subscript>66 </subscript></highlight>after a lapse of a period of time tRAS from the output of the active command ACTV. After the precharge command PRE is supplied to the SDRAM, the SDRAM performs a precharge operation in which data in the page brought into the active state is written again to the same address to thereby bring the page into an idle state. Subsequently, at a time T<highlight><subscript>68 </subscript></highlight>after a lapse of a period of time tRP from the time T<highlight><subscript>66</subscript></highlight>, the control device can output the active command ACTV, and the same operation is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Next, the read operation when the read command with auto precharge is used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When an active command ACTV including a row address outputted from the control device not shown is supplied to the SDRAM at a time T<highlight><subscript>81</subscript></highlight>, the SDRAM brings a page specified from the row address into an active state. At a time T<highlight><subscript>85 </subscript></highlight>after a lapse of a predetermined period of time from the output of the active command ACTV, a read command READA with auto precharge including a column address outputted from the control device is supplied to the SDRAM. Incidentally, the predetermined period of time means a lapse of a period of time tRCD (after which the read command can be outputted) from the output of the active command, and a period of time obtained by subtracting a period of time tBL corresponding to a burst length from a period of time tRAS from the output of the ACTV command until when the precharge operation becomes possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the SDRAM to which the read command READA is supplied starts a precharge operation, in which data in the page brought into the active state is written again in the same address, at a time T<highlight><subscript>86 </subscript></highlight>after the period of time tBL corresponding to the burst length and thereby brings the page into the idle state. Further, the SDRAM, at a time T<highlight><subscript>87</subscript></highlight>, outputs (reads) data DT stored in an address specified by the column address in the page brought into the active state. As stated above, when the read command READA with auto precharge is supplied to the SDRAM, the SDRAM outputs the data in the address specified by the column address and performs the precharge operation automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, at a time T<highlight><subscript>88 </subscript></highlight>after a lapse of a period of time tRP from the time T<highlight><subscript>86</subscript></highlight>, the control device can output the active command ACTV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Similarly, also in a write operation in the conventional SDRAM, there is a write command WRITA with auto precharge for automatically performing the precharge operation as well as the write operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the conventional SDRAM, however, although the read command READA or write command WRITA with auto precharge which enables the read operation or the write operation and the precharge operation to be performed by one read command is provided, an improvement in performance such as data transfer efficiency or the like can not be attained because of various timing constraints such as the period of time tRAS from the output of the active command ACTV until when the precharge operation becomes possible (a period of five clocks in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>), and hence the read command READA and write command WRITA with auto precharge have been hardly used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, a memory called an FCRAM (Fast cycle RAM) has come into use recently, and the various timing constraints such as the period of time tRAS are greatly eased. In the FCRAM, after one clock from the supply of the active command, the precharge operation can be performed. In other words, commands can be supplied continuously to perform operations, and hence the improvement in performance such as data transfer efficiency can be attained by the read command and write command with auto precharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> When only the read command or write command with auto precharge is used, in the FCRAM, a page, which is brought into the active state after the data read or write operation in an address specified by the read command or write command with auto precharge, is inevitably brought into the idle state. Therefore, when the read operation or the write operation is performed for the same page, the control device needs to supply the active command again to the FCRAM, and hence when only the read command or write command with auto precharge is used, the performance such as data transfer efficiency is lowered in some cases. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained below based on the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an example of the configuration of a memory control device to which a control device for a semiconductor memory device according to the first embodiment of the present invention is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> supplies an access request signal REQ to make a request for access (data transfer) to an FCRAM (memory) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and sends and receives input/output data DTO to/from the control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is, for example, composed of a CPU and a DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller). The access request signal REQ includes access class information showing the class of access (read access or write access), and address information showing an address of the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be accessed. Incidentally, it may further include information on the size of data to be transferred and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is composed of a request receiver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and supplies a memory control signal CTL in response to the access request signal REQ supplied from the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The request receiver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> receives the request for access to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of the access request signal REQ and outputs access class information, address information, and the like. The area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a register in which an area (address) in which a command with auto precharge (a read command READA or a write command WRITA) is used when the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is accessed is set. For example, in the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, when there exist a program area where, in many cases, like a program, data are written into sequential addresses and read from sequential addresses on the occasion of read-out, and a data area where, in many cases, data are written into arbitrary addresses and read after random (random) addresses are specified on the occasion of read-out, in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a data area or the like in the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set as an area where the command with auto precharge is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> compares an address shown by the address information supplied from the request receiver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and an address set in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and determines whether or not the address shown by the address information is the area where the command with auto precharge is used. Based on the determination by the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the access class information and the address information of the access request signal REQ, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines a command to be outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and supplies the memory control signal CTL including the command to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> supplies the input/output data DTO supplied from the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as memory data MDT to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and supplies the memory data MDT supplied from the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as the input/output data DTO to the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has an interface similar to an SDRAM, and writes the memory data MDT into the specified address in accordance with the memory control signal CTL supplied from the control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (a write operation), and reads data from the specified address and supplies it as the memory data MDT to the control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (a read operation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Next, operations will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It should be mentioned that, in the following explanation, in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an area (address) in which the command with auto precharge is used at the time of access to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is previously set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> First, the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> outputs the access request signal REQ to the control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to request access to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The request receiver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> within the control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to which the access request signal REQ is supplied, receives an access request from the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and supplies the access class information and the address information to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> based on the access request signal REQ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> compares an address shown by the address information supplied from the request receiver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and an address set in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the address shown by the address information is included in the address set in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output a command with auto precharge. Meanwhile, when the address shown by the address information is not included in the address set in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output an ordinary command (without auto precharge). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Based on the instruction (determination result) from the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the address class information and the address information of the access request signal REQ, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines a command to be outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in accordance with a flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and supplies the memory control signal CTL including the above command to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a processing operation of the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> First, in accessing the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines whether or not the access to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> results in a page error based on the supplied address information in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> compares a row address shown by the address information (for example, upper 12 bits of the address shown by the address information) and a row address of a page currently in an active state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> When the row address shown by the address information and the row address of the page in the active state do not match, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines that the access results in a page error, and advances to step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In the case of a match between them, it determines that the access does not result in a page error (results in a page hit), and advances to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, when there is no page in the active state (all pages are in an idle state), it determines that the access results in a page error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to which the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> advances when the row address shown by the address information and the row address of the page in the active state do not match, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, based on a bank signal not shown, determines whether this page error is a page error in a bank in the active state (the row addresses do not match) or a page error caused because a bank is not in the active state. Here, the bank is composed of a plurality of pages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As a result of the determination, when determining that this page error is the page error in the active state, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> advances to step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and when determining that this page error is caused because the bank is not in the active state, it advances to step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs a precharge command PRE to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to bring the bank in the active state into the idle state and advances to step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in which all pages (bank) in the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are in the idle state, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs an active command ACTV for bringing the page (row address) specified by the address information into the active state to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and advances to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines whether to get read access or write access to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> based on the supplied access class information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the case of read access as a result of the aforesaid determination, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> advances to step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When being instructed to output a command with auto precharge by an instruction (determination result) from the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs a read command READA with auto precharge to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and ends processing. On the other hand, if not, in step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs an ordinary command READ to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and ends processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the case of write access as a result of the determination in step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> advances to step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As is the case of the read access, when being instructed to output a command with auto precharge by an instruction (determination result) from the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs a write command WRITA with auto precharge to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and if not, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs an ordinary write command WRIT to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and ends processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the processing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, commands outputted successively to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are supplied to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by the memory control signal CTL including these commands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> performs a read operation, a write operation, and the like in accordance with the memory control signal CTL including the commands supplied from the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to read stored data and output the data as the memory data MDT, and store the supplied memory data MDT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, as for the input/output data DTO sent and received between the control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) and the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the memory data MDT sent and received between the control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) and the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, their data input/output timings are respectively controlled by the data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> according to access to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and then they are sent and received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> show timing diagrams of the read operation for the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in accordance with the operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a timing diagram when the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> determines that the ordinary command (without auto precharge) is outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> determines that the ordinary command (without auto precharge) is outputted, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs an active command ACTV to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at a time T<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and thereafter outputs the ordinary read command READ to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> until a page error occurs. Namely, during a page hit period (a period during which the same page is accessed), the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs only the ordinary read command READ to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the ordinary read command READ, the data DT is outputted from the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In accessing a different page, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as shown at a time T<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, outputs the precharge command PRE to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to bring all pages into the idle state. At a time T<highlight><subscript>9 </subscript></highlight>after one clock, the active command ACTV to bring the different page into the active state is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and at a time T<highlight><subscript>10</subscript></highlight>, for example, the read command READ is outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a timing diagram when the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> determines that the command with auto precharge is outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> determines that the command with auto precharge is outputted, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs the active command ACTV to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at a time T<highlight><subscript>21</subscript></highlight>, and outputs the read command READA with auto precharge to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at a time T<highlight><subscript>22 </subscript></highlight>after one clock. Thus, the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> outputs the data DT in an address, which is specified by the read command READA, of a page brought into the active state by the active command ACTV at the time T<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>(at a time T<highlight><subscript>23</subscript></highlight>), and performs a precharge operation to bring the page into the idle state. Thereafter, when the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is accessed again, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs the active command ACTV to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown at the time T<highlight><subscript>23</subscript></highlight>, and outputs the read command READA at a time T<highlight><subscript>24</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As explained above in detail, according to the first embodiment, in accessing the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, an address set in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in which an area where the command with auto precharge (read command READA or write command WRITA) is used is set and an address shown by the address information of the access request signal REQ received by the request receiver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are compared. When the address set in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the address shown by the address information match as a result of the above comparison, the command with auto precharge is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and if not, the ordinary command (read command READ or write command WRIT) is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Moreover, in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, for example, the address of the data area where addresses to be accessed are often random or the like is set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Thus, in accessing the area where addresses to be accessed are often random (random), the command with auto precharge is outputted to allow the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to perform the precharge operation automatically without the precharge command PRE being outputted. Moreover, in accessing the area where addresses to be accessed are often sequential, the ordinary command is outputted to allow the read operation or the write operation to be performed continuously without the active command ACTV being outputted at each access. Accordingly, by controlling the command to be outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> depending on the area in the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be accessed, the number of outputs of the command to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be reduced, leading to an increase in data transfer efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, although the area (address) where the command with auto precharge is used is set in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the first embodiment, an area (address) where the ordinary command is used may be set, or both the area (address) where the command with auto precharge is used and the area (address) where the ordinary command is used may be set. Hence, based on the address set in the area setting register <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may determine whether the command with auto precharge is used or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an example of the configuration of a memory control device to which a control device for a semiconductor memory device according to the second embodiment of the present invention is applied. It should be mentioned that, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the same numerals and symbols are given to blocks having the same functions as blocks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and a repeated explanation is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, similarly to the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> master <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> supplies the access request signal REQ to a control device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and sends and receives the input/output data DTO to/from the control device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Further, the master <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> supplies an access type signal S/R indicating access type information that access to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is sequential access to sequential addresses or random access to random addresses, to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The control device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is composed of a request receiver <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, an auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The request receiver <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> receives an access request by means of the access request signal REQ supplied from the master <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and outputs the access class information, the address information, and the like. Moreover, the request receiver <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> outputs the access type information (sequential access or random access) to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> based on the access type signal S/R supplied with the access request signal REQ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Based on the access type information supplied from the request receiver <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> determines whether the command with auto precharge is used or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Next, operations will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> When being supplied with the access type signal S/R together with the access request signal REQ by the master <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and receiving the access request, the request receiver <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> supplies the access class information, the address information, and the access type information to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> based on these access request signal REQ and access type signal S/R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Based on the access type information supplied from the request receiver <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> determines whether the access requested from the master <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is sequential access or random access. As a result of the determination, if the access requested from the master <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is sequential access, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the ordinary command (without auto precharge), and if the access is random access, it instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the command with auto precharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Operations after this by the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the like are the same as those in the first embodiment, and hence they are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> It should be mentioned that timing diagrams of the read operation for the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment are the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the second embodiment, in accessing the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, based on the access type signal S/R supplied with the access request signal REQ, the command with auto precharge is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the case of random access, and the ordinary command is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the case of sequential access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Thereby, in the case of access to random addresses by means of random access, by outputting the command with auto precharge, the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is allowed to perform the precharge operation automatically without the precharge command PRE being outputted. In the case of access to sequential addresses by means of sequential access, by outputting the ordinary command, the read operation or the write operation can be performed continuously without the active command ACTV being outputted at each access. Accordingly, by controlling the command to be outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> according to the way of access to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the number of outputs of the command to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be reduced, leading to an increase in data transfer efficiency. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing an example of the configuration of a memory control device to which a control device for a semiconductor memory device according to the third embodiment of the present invention is applied. It should be mentioned that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the same numerals and symbols are given to blocks having the same functions as blocks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and a repeated explanation is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, similarly to the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> master <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> supplies the access request signal REQ to a control device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and sends and receives the input/output data DTO to/from the control device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. It should be mentioned that the access request signal REQ in this embodiment includes data size information showing the size of data to be transferred in addition to the access class information and the address information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The control device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is composed of a request receiver <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, a transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, an auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The request receiver <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> receives an access request by means of the access request signal REQ supplied from the master <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, and based on this access request signal REQ, outputs the access class information, the address information, and the like to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the data size information to the transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> computes the number of outputs of the read command or the write command to be outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, based on a burst length (the number of times of data input/output operations performed per one command) set in the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the width of a data bus to send and receive the memory data MDT. For example, when the data size shown by the data size information is 32 bits, the burst length set in the FCRAM is two, and the width of the data bus to send and receive the memory data MDT is eight bits, the number of outputs of the command is 32/(2&times;8)&equals;2. Further, with the above computed number of outputs as an initial value, the transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> decrements a counter value by one and supplies the counter value to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> each time the read command or the write command is outputted from the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Based on the counter value supplied from the transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> determines that the command with auto precharge is outputted only at the time of the last command output, and instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the command with auto precharge. At all other times than the last command output, it determines that the ordinary command is outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, operations will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> When receiving the access request by means of the access request signal REQ from the master <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the request receiver <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, based on this access request signal REQ, outputs the access class information, the address information, and the like to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, and outputs the data size information to the transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to which the data size information is supplied computes the number of outputs of the command (read command or write command) to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> based on the burst length of the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the width of the data bus to send and receive the memory data MDT. Moreover, it sets the computed number of outputs as the initial value and supplies the counter value to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> If the counter value supplied from the transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is one, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the command with auto precharge, and if not, it instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the ordinary command (without auto precharge). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In response to the above instruction from the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines the command to be outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the same manner as in the first embodiment, and outputs the memory control signal CTL including that command. On this occasion, the transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> decrements the counter value by one and supplies the counter value to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> each time the read command READ or the write command WRIT is outputted from the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Thereby, when plural times of access to sequential addresses in the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are needed because the data size shown by the data size information is larger than (the burst length set in the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>)&times;(the width of the data bus to send and receive the memory data MDT), the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> determines that the command with auto precharge is outputted only at the time of the last command output, and instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the command with auto precharge. At all other times than the last command output, it determines that the ordinary command is outputted and instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the ordinary command. Namely, commands are outputted from the control device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an example of a timing diagram of a read operation according to the third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> It should be mentioned that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a case where the number of outputs of the read command computed by the transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> based on the data size information is four. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> At a time T<highlight><subscript>41</subscript></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs the active command ACTV to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> then outputs the ordinary read command READ to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at times T<highlight><subscript>42</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>43</subscript></highlight>, and T<highlight><subscript>44 </subscript></highlight>which are one time fewer than the total number of outputs of the read command in this access. At a time T<highlight><subscript>45 </subscript></highlight>which is the last read command output in this access, the read command READA with auto precharge is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, when the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is accessed again, for example, as shown at a time T<highlight><subscript>46</subscript></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> outputs the active command ACTV to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to start the access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> According to the third embodiment as explained above, based on the number of outputs of command computed by the transfer number counter <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> from the data size information of the access request signal REQ received by the request receiver <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the command with auto precharge only as the command outputted lastly is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and at all other times, the ordinary command is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Hence, in accessing the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> more than one time at sequential addresses in order to transfer a data quantity requested by the access request, the ordinary command is outputted to continuously perform the read operation or the write operation during a period of sequential access. When the period of sequential access ends, the command with auto precharge is outputted to allow the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to perform the precharge operation automatically without the precharge command PRE being outputted. Consequently, in the case of sequential access, the number of outputs of the command to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be minimized, leading to an increase in data transfer efficiency. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, similarly to the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first and second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> respectively supply access request signals REQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to a control device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and send and receive the input/output data DTO to/from the control device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The control device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is composed of a request receiver <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, an auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The request receiver <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> receives access requests by means of the access request signals REQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> supplied from the first and second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> respectively, and outputs the access class information, the address information, and the like to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> based on the access request signals REQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the request receiver <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is designed in such a manner that the access request signals REQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are inputted via different input terminals, generates master information showing which of the first and second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> an access request is received from, and outputs the master information to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Based on the master information supplied from the request receiver <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> determines whether the command with auto precharge is used or not. Incidentally, in the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, according as whether the first and second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> are masters which, like a CPU or a peripheral circuit, make a request for access to random addresses separately or masters which, like a DMAC, make a request for access to a certain area (plural sequential addresses), whether the command with auto precharge is used or not is previously determined for each of the first and the second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It should be mentioned that, in the following explanation, in the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, it is determined that the ordinary command is used for access to the FCRAM from the first master <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, and that the command with auto precharge is used for access thereto from the second master <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Next, operations will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> When receiving access requests from the first and second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> by means of the access request signals REQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the request receiver <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> supplies the access class information and the address information to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> based on the supplied access request signals REQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and REQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the request receiver <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> determines which of the first and second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> each of the access requests is received from by the supplied access request signal REQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or REQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and supplies the determination result as the master information to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Based on the master information supplied from the request receiver <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the ordinary command in the case of the access request from the first master <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, and instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the command with auto precharge in the case of the access request from the second master <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Operations after this by the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the like are the same as those in the first embodiment, and hence they are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> It should be mentioned that a timing diagram of the read operation for the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the fourth embodiment is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in the first embodiment in the case of the access request from the first mater <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, and the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in the first embodiment in the case of the access request from the second mater <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> According to the fourth embodiment as explained above, in accordance with the access request signal REQ<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or REQ<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> received by the request receiver <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, that is, the master <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> which outputted the access request signal, whether the command with auto precharge or the ordinary command is outputted is determined, and then the determined command is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Thereby, when the master, which accesses random addresses in many cases, accesses the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the command with auto precharge is outputted, whereby the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is allowed to perform the precharge operation automatically without the precharge command PRE being outputted. When the master, which accesses sequential addresses in many cases, accesses the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the ordinary command is outputted, whereby the read operation or the write operation is allowed to be performed continuously without the active command ACTV being outputted at each access. For example, in the case of the access request from the master which, like the DMAC or the like, accesses sequential addresses in many cases, the ordinary command can be outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Therefore, by appropriately controlling the command to be outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> according to the way of access of the master to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the number of outputs of the command to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be reduced, leading to an increase in data transfer efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in the fourth embodiment, in the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, whether the command with auto precharge is used or not is previously determined for each of the first and second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, but as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it may be set by providing a master setting register <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> capable of changing whether the command with auto precharge is used or not in each of the first and second masters <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> from the outside. In such a case, when instructing the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the ordinary command or the command with auto precharge depending on the supplied master information, it is recommended that an auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> determine whether the ordinary command or the command with auto precharge is outputted with reference to the master setting register <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and then instruct the control controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the determined command. Furthermore, the provision of the master set register <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> can enhance general versatility that regardless of the date of manufacture, at any given time, whether the command with auto precharge is used or not can be changed and set in each master. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, similarly to the master <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> master <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> supplies the access request signal REQ to a control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and sends and receives the input/output data DTO to/from the control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The control device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is composed of a request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the data transferor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> receives an access request from the master <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by means of the access request signal REQ, and based on the access class information of the access request signal REQ, when the access request is write access, it outputs the address information and a write access request signal WRQ to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. When the access request is read access, the request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> gives the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> notice to this effect, and supplies the address information to the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> counts up the address (a column address portion in the address) shown by the address information supplied from the request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to generate an address to prefetch data in predetermined sequential addresses subsequent to the address in the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> shown by the address information. Then, the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> outputs a read access request signal PRQ with the address shown by the supplied address information and the generated address to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Moreover, if the address becomes an address of another page, that is, a carry is generated in the address count-up of the column address portion in the address when the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is generating the address to prefetch data, the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> gives the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to this effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> determines whether the command with auto precharge is used or not based on the write access request signal WRQ supplied from the request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the read access request signal RRQ supplied from the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Next, operations will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> When receiving the access request from the master <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> by means of the access request signal REQ, the request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> determines whether the access request is write access or read access based on the access class information of the supplied access request signal REQ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> When the access request from the master <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is write access as the result of the above determination, the request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> supplies the write request signal WRQ with the address information to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the command with auto precharge when the write request signal WRQ is supplied thereto from the request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> When the access request from the master <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is read access as the result of the above determination by the request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the request receiver <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> gives the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> notice to this effect, and supplies the address information to the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, which receives notice to the effect that the access request is read access, counts up the address (a portion corresponding to the column address in the address) shown by the supplied address information to generate the address to prefetch the data. Furthermore, the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> supplies the address information, the generated address to prefetch data, and the read request signal RRQ to the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, if a carry is generated when the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> counts up the address, the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> gives the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> notice to this effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> When being supplied with the read request signal RRQ and not being given notice to the effect that a carry is generated by the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the ordinary command. Moreover, when being supplied with the read request signal RRQ but given notice to the effect that a carry is generated by the prefetch controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the auto precharge determiner <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> instructs the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to output the command with auto precharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Operations after this by the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the like are the same as those in the first embodiment, and hence they are omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> By the operations described above, in the fifth embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, as long as the read access is requested from the master <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and no carry is generated in the address to prefetch data, the ordinary read command READ is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the command controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and if not so, the command with auto precharge READA or WRITA is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, as for a timing diagram of the read operation for the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the fifth embodiment, similarly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shown in the third embodiment, the ordinary read command READ is outputted continuously to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and when a carry is generated in the address to prefetch data at this time, as shown at the time T<highlight><subscript>45</subscript></highlight>, the read command READA with auto precharge is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> As explained above, according to the fifth embodiment, when the read access is requested from the master <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, data in the predetermined sequential addresses subsequent to the address specified by the request are prefetched. Then, when the read access is requested by the access request from the master <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the ordinary command is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and when the write access is requested by the access request, the command with auto precharge is outputted to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Thus, when the read access is requested by the access request, the ordinary command is outputted and the data is prefetched, whereby in the case of access to sequential addresses, the time required for the read operation can be shortened, leading to an increase in data transfer efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, although timing diagrams of the read operation are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> in the first to fifth embodiments, as concerns the write operation, data with the write command WRIT or WRITA has only to be supplied to the FCRAM <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and timing diagrams of basic operations regarding command output when the ordinary write command WRIT and the write command WRITA with auto precharge are the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The present embodiments are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and no restrictive, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the sprit or essential characteristics thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As explained above, based on a received request for access to a semiconductor memory device, whether or not an access instruction for enabling an auto precharge function of automatically performing a precharge operation is supplied to the semiconductor memory device is determined, and in accordance with the result of the determination, the access instruction for enabling the auto precharge function or an access instruction for disabling the auto precharge function is supplied to the semiconductor memory device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Thus, it becomes possible to determine whether or not the request for access to the semiconductor memory device is appropriate for the supply of the access instruction for enabling the auto precharge function and then appropriately supply a command which is the access instruction to the semiconductor memory device, whereby data transfer efficiency can be increased. </paragraph>
