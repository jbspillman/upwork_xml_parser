<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions suitable for use on mammalian skin. These compositions comprise a bonding agent capable of attaching a cosmetic benefit agent to mammalian skin. In particular, the bonding agent is a functionally alkylating compound linked to the cosmetic benefit agents that are then in turn linked directly or indirectly to the skin. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the skin beauty care field that cosmetic benefit agents may be topically applied to human skin. There are a number of benefit agents that can be applied to the skin for varying purposes including moisturizers, humectants, color cosmetics, etc. There is, however, a common problem that arises in each of these areas. The problem is the lack of substantivity of the cosmetic benefit agents to the skin to which they are applied. That is, the benefit agents that are applied fail to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the skin such that a longwear result is achieved to any noticeable extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to solve this substantivity deficiency that is typical in topically applied products by utilizing a chemical hook based technology. The operative chemical hook of the present invention is a functionally alkylating bonding agent that serves as a gluing mechanism between a cosmetic benefit agent of interest and one or more protein molecules that are found in the skin. In particular, Applicants have found that functionally alkylating compounds serve as suitable bonding agents such that improved substantivity of various benefit agents are observed on the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Without being limited by theory, the chemical hook bonding agents covalently bond to certain amino acids present in proteinaceous substrates like skin, cuticles, and hair to form a substantive attachment of the desired cosmetic benefit agent to the substrate as demonstrated by the chemical reaction that follows </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Hydrophobic Conditioning Agents </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The cosmetic benefit agent may be one or more hydrophobic conditioning agents. Preferably, the weighted arithmetic mean solubility parameter of the hydrophobic conditioning agent is less than or equal to 10.5. It is recognized, based on this mathematical definition of solubility parameters, that it is possible, for example, to achieve the required weighted arithmetic mean solubility parameter, i.e., less than or equal to 10.5, for a hydrophobic conditioning agent comprising two or more compounds if one of the compounds has an individual solubility parameter greater than 10.5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Solubility parameters are well known to the formulation chemist of ordinary skill in the art and are routinely used as a guide for determining compatibilities and solubilities of materials in the formulation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The solubility parameter of a chemical compound, &dgr;, is defined as the square root of the cohesive energy density for that compound. Typically, a solubility parameter for a compound is calculated from tabulated values of the additive group contributions for the heat of vaporization and molar volume of the components of that compound, using the following equation:

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Surfactants can also be included into the compositions of the present invention, particularly when the compositions are useful for cleansing skin. A lathering surfactant is preferred for use in such instances. As used herein, &ldquo;lathering surfactant&rdquo; means a surfactant, which when combined with water and mechanically agitated generates a foam or lather. Such surfactants are preferred since increased lather is important to consumers as an indication of cleansing effectiveness. In certain personal care embodiments, the surfactants or combinations of surfactants are preferably mild. As used herein, &ldquo;mild&rdquo; means that the surfactants as well as to the articles of the present invention demonstrate skin mildness at least milder than common bar soap matrices that typically comprise a combination of natural soap and synthetic surfactant (e.g., Lever 2000&reg; and Zest&reg;). Methods for measuring mildness, or inversely the irritancy, of surfactant containing articles, are based on a skin barrier destruction test. In this test, the milder the surfactant, the lesser the skin barrier is destroyed. Skin barrier destruction is measured by the relative amount of radio-labeled (tritium labeled) water (3H-H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) that passes from the test solution through the skin epidermis into the physiological buffer contained in the diffusate chamber. This test is described by T. J. Franz in the J. <highlight><italic>Invest. Dermatol., </italic></highlight>1975, 64, pp. 190-195; and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,525, to Small et al., issued Jun. 16, 1987. Other testing methodologies for determining surfactant mildness well known to one skilled in the art can also be used. </paragraph>

Heat to no higher than 40&deg; C. while mixing until modified ascorbate is dissolved. Add FD&amp;C Yellow/Red. Mix until dissolved. Prepare the Oil Phase. Add part C ingredients to oil phase except Permethyl 101A and begin heating to 70-80&deg; C. while mixing Maintain Temperature once heated. Prepare the water phase. Add USP water to appropriate pyrex beaker, and begin heating to 70-80 C while mixing with a prop blade at 250-500 rpm. When water phase is between 70-80&deg; C. add Disodium EDTA and Arlatone 2121 to beaker and allow to dissolve. Mix at least 5 minutes. When Oil &amp; Water phases are between 70-80&deg; C. begin to mill water phase. Slowly add oil phase to water phase while milling. Mill for 2-3 min. Add Particulate premix(part D) slowly, by hand pouring Add neutralization premix (part A) slowly. Cool batch to 60&deg; C. and add sepigel. Switch to U-blade once formula looks smooth. Cool batch to 50&deg; C., then add modified ascorbate premix, Benzyl alcohol and Q2-1402. Cool batch to 40&deg; C. with periodic spatula mixing to insure homogeneity. When temperature reaches 40&deg; C., add fragrance. Mill for 2-3 minutes. </paragraph>
