<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to microelectromechanical (MEMS) sytems, and more particularly to flow controllers for use in MEMS systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Most flow controllers are made of discrete components and are single channel. This invention has fabricated multi-channel flow controllers integrated onto a single substrate using microfabrication (MEMS) processes. This approach integrates the normally separated functions of flow measurement, feedback, and control enabling miniaturization of these devices. The functions of sensing, feedback control, and communication with a host computer are performed by a dedicated microprocessor on the same substrate. Miniaturization of components allows for the reduction of dead volume and increased portability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Miniaturization of components also allows for the incorporation of multiple channels of various sizes within the footprint of a conventional single channel flow controller made from discrete components. A multi-channel flow controller enables changes in flow ranges without having to change out the flow controller itself as is now the practice in the semiconductor industry. This saves on labor costs and reduces the number of different ranges of flow controllers that must be stocked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Flow controllers require a valve. In the prior art, the lack of suitably fast, reliable valves produced by MEMS processes has prevented the fabrication of truly integrated MEMS-produced flow controllers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a general object of the invention to provide new and improved fluid flow controllers which are of sufficient minature size for enabling their use in MEMS applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention provides minature proportional microvalves that can be configured in multiple valve arrays. These microvalves are much smaller than the smallest currently available solenoid valve. It is the use of this very small valve along with thin film sensors, which sense fluid flow and/or pressure and/or temperature, that enables a significant reduction in size.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one preferred embodiment, the invention provides a flow controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) of minature size suitable for use in microelectromechanical (&ldquo;MEMS&rdquo;) systems that controls fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Flow controller <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes a thin film microvalve array, shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is formed by micromaching on a chip substrate. Any desired number of microvalves can be employed in such an array, and in the illustrated embodiment the array comprises four microvalves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. Each microvalve is comprised of a valve actuator <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (shown only for valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) having a thin film operating element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> formed of a shape memory alloy (SMA) to control fluid flow, a sensor or sensors (FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-A, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-B and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-C) to measure flow rate and/or fluid temperature and/or fluid pressure, and channels <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (FIG. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) connecting the sensor(s) and microvalve through which flow takes place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> SMA operating element <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in actuator die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-A and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-B) preferably is comprised of nickel-titanium thin film shape memory alloy. The alloy undergoes a crystalline phase change transformation, and resulting shape change, from a low temperature deformable shape to a high temperature memory shape when the element is heated through the alloy&apos;s phase change transformation temperature. When so heated, the shape change can be used to perform work. In this invention the work occurs as the operating element changes shape so as to move within or across a valve channel to partially or completely open or close the fluid flow path. The actuator is proportional in operation. The thin film SMA actuator can be formed on a substrate by the methods set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,914 to Busch et. al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by this reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The assembly of components of microvalve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is typical in the invention, is shown in the exploded views of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-B and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-B. The microvalve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, O-ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, orifice die <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, spacer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, actuator die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, bias spring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. These components are assembled together as shown in the Figures by suitable means such as pogo pins <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and screws <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Bias spring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> serves the function of applying a yieldable force against actuator element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so as to move it from the memory shape to the deformable shape when the element&apos;s temperature is below the transformation temperature. The force of element <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> when actuated toward its memory shape is sufficent to overcome the spring bias force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The SMA operated microvalves of the invention can provide proportional control, which is desirable for many applications. The flow sensor measures fluid mass passing by a point in a fixed time, or measures the pressure drop across a calibrated orifice. All of the components can be fabricated on a single small chip by known methods of photolithography and micromaching of silicon substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Particular advantages of the invention are that the SMA actuators are so small that multiple actuators may be placed in a space without increasing the package size. This has the important consequence that if several valves are packaged together with each having its own flow channel, then the dynamic range of the flow controller can be extended. Conventional sensors always have a range over. which they work best. A sensor that measures accurately to 0.1% in the range of 10 to 1000 ml/min is not accurate in the range of 0.001 to 1 ml/min. In the invention when a set-point is specified, the appropriate range is selected by software. An advantage is that the user need only buy one, not multiple, controllers. Then when flow rate must be changed, it can be done in the system software without opening a line and interrupting the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a substrate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of a ceramic with wire-bonded electrical leads <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Mounted on the substrate are two or more microvalves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; of the valve array, a sensor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which can comprise either a flow, pressure or temperature sensor, and an electronic controller board <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The microvalves can be fabricated in accordance with the methods of U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,880 to A. David Johnson et. al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by this reference. The channels for providing fluid flow paths between the valves, sensors and inlet/outlet ports are formed in layers (not shown) of a suitable material that can be sputter deposited over the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The overall control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> provides feedback to adjust each microvalve so that the measured flow matches a preset value, called the set-point. Feedback can be performed by a microprocessor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> running on suitably programmed software. The circuit comprises first pressure sensor circuit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, second pressure sensor circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, temperature sensor circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, flow sensor circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and microprocessor circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The first and second pressure sensor circuits <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, respectively. Temperature sensor circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, and flow sensor circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Microprocessor circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises a suitable programmable microprocessor such as a PIC16C74A chip <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. First and second pressure sensor circuits <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> have respective leads <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which connect with respective chip terminals <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Temperature sensor circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has a lead <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which connects with chip terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. And flow sensor circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has a lead <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which connects with chip terminal <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A suitable MEMS flow sensor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided on at least one of the substrates to control flow rates. For this purpose, the microprocessor circuit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is programmed with suitable software. A feedback loop is incorporated in the software to minimize fluctuations. In the preferred embodiment the microprocessor chip is programmed to control the pulse width to the valve actuator via RS232 serial communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The invention employs a graphical user interface (GUI) which is programmed in a suitable language such as Visual Basic &trade;. For purposes of illustration, dual channel operation has been chosen. Multi-channel operation can be achieved by expanding the GUI interface and increasing the number of channels on the controller hardware. The GUI interface can be displayed on a PC and is connected to the PIC16C74A via RS232 communication. The operator chooses a sensor supported by the software and selects the desired communications port. Then the operator selects the desired channel. The operator then enters the setpoint for each channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-A and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-B show a manifold <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for a dual channel flow controller embodiment of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the manifold <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> with flow restrictors <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> extending from opposite sides. This manifold enables a user to switch between various channel sizes without having to switch out the controller itself. The flow controller comprises first and second ceramic substrates mounted on the Delryn &reg; plastic manifold <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, with flow range selection achieved by the flow restrictors. The first substrate comprises two differential pressure sensors of the type which measure differential pressure drop across the restricor tubes. The flow restrictors <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are formed of stainless steel tubing which are pinched at <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> to smaller effective cross sections while connecting to a flow meter. This flow controller has two ranges&mdash;from 1 to 100 SCCM and from 1 to 1,000 SCCM. The controller requires two valves for shut-off and two proportional valves. It also comprises a four-valve multiple microvalve array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, manifold <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is formed with a pair of microvalves <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> which are connected through channels <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; with respective flow restrictors <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Inlet ports <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and outlet ports <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> direct flow to and from the respective microvalves. Pressure transducers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are provided in the flow paths for the respective microvalves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Components of sensor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are shown in schematically in the plan view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>-A, the cross section view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>-B and isometric view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>-C. This sensor is comprised of three resistors H, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> located at the middle of a layer of Si membrane formed by anisotroopic wet etching of the Si layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The three resistors are formed by diffusing boron into the Si membrane. To configure the flow sensor, the resistor H is used as the heater element and resistors T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are used as temperature sensors, with one temperature sensor located upstream related to the heater and the other downstream, as shown for T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>-A where the flow is depicted as from right to left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> When there is no fluid flow, the heat produced by the heater H is equally distributed to T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When there is flow, there is an imbalance in the heat distribution which is detected by the circuit measuring the differential resistance of T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a mass flow controller system for operating an SMA microvalve actuator <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> in the invention. The flow from the source is read by flow sensor <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and converted from analog to digital signals by the microprocessor circuit. At step <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> the digital signal is compared to the set-point that has been specified by the user. The average current into valve <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> is then increased or decreased, thereby regulating the downstream flow. All flow sensor, valve and electronics components are micrfrabricated and attached to a common substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Flow sensor <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> can be of the type shown in the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>-A which measures pressure differential across a restrictor, as in the embodiment explained in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the flow sensor could be of the type shown in the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>-B which is responsive to measurement of absolute pressure. In this case, the software would be altered to provide feedback as a pressure regulator. In both systems of FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-A and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-B, signals from the pressure sensor are compared with the set-point value to control a proportional valve by means of the microprocessor software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a simplified flow chart of the flow control algorithm for the mass flow controller system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Software resident in microprocessor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> controls the average current to microvalve actuator <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) to bring measured flow into equality with the set-point flow. All functions of analog to digital conversion, timing, comparison of measured flow to set-point and communication with the host computer are embodied in the single chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a block diagram for another embodiment providing a dual range mass flow controller. Conventional flow sensors have limited dynamic range. For example, a sensor which is accurate at medium flow rates will give inaccurate performance at high or very low flows. In existing equipment, it is standard practice to replace the restrictors to change the range. This requires opening the line while the change is being made, and recalibration is usually necessary. Normal practice is to provide factory restrictors which are not changed in the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> With the present invention, multiple flow paths can be fabricated in very small spaces so that the appropriate sensor/restrictor combination can be used for a desired flow range. This enables having separate valves for each flow range in a small package. The circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> has separate flow channel in limited space, thereby enabling a flow controller with much greater dynamic range and hence increased versatility without increasing cost. One micromachined flow controller may replace a series of conventional separate flow controllers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is controlled by the micropocessor software to determine from the preestablished set-point which of the two channel paths to open. A flow sensor feeds information back for proportional control. As flow increases, the upper limit of flow is reached, and a separate valve-sensor combination is opened. This system can be made without increasing the overall size significantly because most of the volume of the controller is the package; sensors and valves can be orders of magnitude smaller when they are integrated in such a package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The overall control circuit (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) reads output from each sensor and gives feedback so that flow will remain at the desired setpoint. This control circuit has certain desirable features: a data acquisition port monitoring exciter currents, sensor outputs, amplifier outputs, actuator drivers and currents, and a single connector to connect the actuator/flow-sensor/press-sensor/temp-sensor package. This circuit also has an actuator-driver that can be scaled to drive up to four actuators, the selection of which is controlled by the program&apos;s operator screen. Besides being able to logically enable/disable this driver, its power is limited so that it should not be able to bum-up an actuator. This circuit also has an LED indicator to show that the PIC-chip has initialized and is ready: if the PIC-chip should be caused to reset, the LED will blink &ldquo;on&rdquo; during each initialization routine. </paragraph>
