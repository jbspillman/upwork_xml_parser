<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a transaction system that performs settlement processing for a transaction with a customer, and more particularly relates to a transaction system, which, in a case where settlement processing, by means of a mobile terminal device not having a print function, is in progress, is capable of printing out a receipt from a separate device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a case in which a product is purchased at a retail shop, like that in a department store or a shopping center, and settlement is performed by means of a credit card or a debit card settlement is performed using a cash card (bank card), settlement processing is carried out by means of a POS (Point of Sale) terminal (hereinafter, in this specification, &ldquo;POS terminal&rdquo; refers to an installed transaction terminal device that has a POS function or settlement function, for example), which is installed at a pay counter. For example, when a settlement is by credit card, the POS terminal reads card information for a credit card received by a shop employee, performs a credit inquiry by communicating with the server of a credit company, and then prints a receipt. The shop employee asks the customer to sign the receipt, and, after checking the signature on the receipt against the signature on the credit card, returns the credit card to the customer and gives the product to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in recent years, mobile-type transaction terminal devices having a settlement function (sometimes referred to simply as mobile terminals hereinbelow) have been appearing on the market. Such mobile terminals having a settlement function comprise, in addition to a predetermined input unit (touch panel or keyboard) and a display unit, a card reader for reading card information from a credit card or cash card, and a communications function for communicating with the server of a credit company for the purpose of a credit inquiry in the case of a credit card. When a mobile terminal of this kind is given to a shop employee on the sales floor, the shop employee is able to perform settlement processing such as the reading of card information or a credit inquiry at the point of contact with the customer, without going to a pay counter where a POS terminal is installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, in a case where a mobile terminal of this kind does not contain a printer for the printing of receipts, it is not possible to perform the print processing of receipts required for settlement processing. In a case such as this, there is a requirement to print a receipt via a separate device that has a print function, such as a POS terminal installed at a pay counter. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a transaction system, which, in a case where settlement processing is performed using a mobile-type transaction terminal device that does not have a print function, is capable of printing out a receipt from a predetermined device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to resolve the above-mentioned object, according to the present invention, in a case where a transaction with a customer is performed using a mobile terminal that has a settlement function, the mobile terminal creates receipt data and registers same on a server. Thereafter, a separate device, which has a print function, acquires this receipt data from the server to print same in the form of a receipt, which means that it is possible to print a receipt for a transaction performed by means of a mobile terminal which does not have a print function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A preferable constitution for the transaction system according to the present invention, which serves to resolve the above object, is such that a transaction system executing transactions with a customer, comprises: a mobile terminal device for executing settlement processing for a transaction; a server having a receipt data that is information printed on a receipt for the transaction; and a printing device for acquiring the receipt data from the server via a communications line to print a receipt in accordance with this receipt data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For example, in the above constitution, on the basis of the settlement processing, the mobile terminal device creates the receipt data, and transaction information (a transaction log) relating to the content of the transaction that contains information on the receipt data, and transmits the receipt data and the transaction information to the server via a communications line, and wherein, on the basis of a request from the printing device, the server transmits the receipt data to the printing device. More preferably, when the receipt data is printed, the server erases the receipt data on the basis of a notification from the printing device.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a first settlement processing flow chart according to the transaction system relating to the present embodiment. When a customer decides to purchase a product, the shop employee registers the sale in the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a figure to illustrate processing, for the registration of a sale, in the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, screens of the display unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are shown by way of example, these screens being displayed in accordance with the progress of the processing. The display unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a touch panel, for example, and, when the shop employee touches predetermined parts of the display unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the processing progresses sequentially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> menu screen M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is an initial screen, is displayed by the display unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the shop employee selects &ldquo;Sale&rdquo;, a screen M<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> requiring the input of a sales employee code is displayed. The shop employee inputs his or her own sales employee code by means of the keyboard, or inputs the sales employee code by reading a bar code, which is printed on a badge, by means of a bar code scanner, for example, and then depresses an &ldquo;ENT&rdquo; key to confirm the sales employee code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a product input screen M<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is displayed. The shop employee uses a bar code scanner to read a product bar code printed on the price tag attached to the product which the customer is going to purchase. Upon acquiring the product bar code, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> uses the POS function thereof to access a product server via a communications line in order to acquire information on the product such as the product name and price that correspond to this product bar code, and then displays the product registration screen M<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The inputting of products is not limited to the reading of a product bar code, but instead may be performed by inputting a bar code number using the keyboard, and may also be performed by means of a selection operation from product groups which have been pre-registered in the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When product inputting is complete, upon depressing the &ldquo;ENT&rdquo; key to determine the amount payable, the settlement amount screen M<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is displayed and the sale registration processing is thereby completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Returning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, upon completion of sale registration, the shop employee then performs payment registration processing (S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). Using the settlement amount screen M<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the shop employee selects either a settlement by credit card or a debit card settlement by means of a cash card, in accordance with the settlement method selected by the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When a credit card settlement is selected, the shop employee receives a credit card from the customer and then reads card information stored on the credit card (the credit card number or the like) by means of a card reader. When the card information is read normally, confirmation that reading has been completed normally is displayed (not shown in the figure), and when the shop employee depresses the &ldquo;ENT&rdquo; key, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> automatically forms a communications connection with the server of a credit company to thereby perform credit check processing. Upon receiving settlement authorization information from the server of the credit company, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> displays the settlement authorization confirmation (not shown in the figure), and the shop employee depresses the &ldquo;ENT&rdquo; key, following confirmation of this display, to thus complete payment registration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when a debit card settlement is selected, the shop employee receives a cash card from the customer and then reads card information stored on the cash card (the bank account number or the like) by means of a card reader. When the card information is read normally, confirmation that reading has been completed normally is displayed (not shown in the figure), and, by depressing the &ldquo;ENT&rdquo; key, the password information input screen (not shown in the figure) is then displayed. The shop employee gives the mobile terminal to the customer and the password information is then inputted by the customer using the keyboard. Once the password information has been inputted, when the shop employee depresses the &ldquo;ENT&rdquo; key, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> automatically forms a communications connection with the server of a financial institution to thereby perform settlement confirmation processing. Upon receiving settlement authorization information from the server of the financial institution, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> displays the settlement authorization confirmation (not shown in the figure), and the shop employee depresses the &ldquo;ENT&rdquo; key, following confirmation of this display, to thus complete payment registration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Returning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when payment registration processing is complete, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> creates a transaction log and receipt data (S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). The transaction log is so-called data relating to a transaction with a customer and contains a vast amount of information in connection with a single transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a constitutional example of data for a transaction log. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the transaction log is constituted by electronic text items such as a header, common information, detail information, settlement information and a footer, for example. Each of the electronic text items begins, for example, with a start code, and contains an item classification, the length of the electronic text, and the number of information items, and contains specific information pertaining to each item, and, last of all, is ended by an end code. Further, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, one constitutional example of a header and of detail information is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The header is a part to show the start of the transaction log, and information items may include information such as the identification number of the transaction terminal, the transaction number, the company code, the shop code, the transaction date, or the like, (which may be a mobile terminal, or a POS terminal), for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The common information overlaps with the header information, but, in addition to the identification number of the transaction terminal, the transaction number, and the shop code, and the like, common information includes the shop section code, the sub-section code, the transaction classification, the transaction processing time, the transaction start time, the transaction completion time, and the sales employee code, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The detail information includes the product classification, the product name, the number of units, the unit price, the total (unit price x number of units), the cost price, the discount classification, the form of supply, the supplier code, the shop section code, the sub-section code, the bar code number (PLU code), and the like, for each product purchased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The settlement information includes the settlement classification (whether by credit card or debit card), the card classification (the type of credit card, or the name of the financial institution), the card information (the card number or bank account number), the password information inputted (in the case of a cash card), the expiry date of the card (in the case of a credit card), the settled amount, the amount of tax, the authorization number from the credit company or the financial institution, the payment classification (one lump payment made the month following, payment by installments, and the like), and the amount each time when payment is by installments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The footer is a part that shows the end of the transaction log, and contains a variety of information apart from that mentioned above in relation to a transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the receipt data pertaining to the present embodiment is data generated by the extraction of information to be printed on a receipt from information contained in a transaction log. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a figure to show a constitutional example of receipt data. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the receipt data begins with a start code, and contains the transaction date, the transaction start time, the sales employee code, the product name, the bar code number, the number of units, the unit price, the total amount, the transaction number, and the terminal number, and ends with an end code. Therefore, in comparison with a transaction log, receipt data is constituted by an extremely small amount of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Further, upon completion of payment registration processing, when the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> creates a transaction log, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extracts the above-mentioned information required for the printing of a receipt from the information contained in the transaction log, to thereby create receipt data, and transmits the transaction log and the receipt data to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Upon receiving the transaction log and the receipt data, the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> stores same in a transaction log DB (database) and a receipt data DB (S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when a shop employee uses the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to accomplish payment registration processing, the shop employee moves, accompanied by the customer, to a pay counter where a POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a print function is installed (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> {circle over (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>)}). The shop employee then operates the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> installed at the pay counter to access the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an example of a screen displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the shop employee selects a &ldquo;Receipt Data&rdquo; button, for example. In a case where the display unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a touch panel, the shop employee touches the part of the screen constituting the &ldquo;Receipt Data&rdquo; button. Thereupon, the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> accesses the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to request the receipt data (step S<highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> reads all the receipt data stored in the receipt data DB and then transmits this data to the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that generated the request (step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). There are cases where receipt data from a plurality of mobile terminals is respectively recorded in the receipt data DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving the receipt data, the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> displays this receipt data in the form of a list (step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). In the example of a screen shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> receipt data list is displayed, but the terminal number, the transaction number, and the total amount, in each item of receipt data, are displayed. The shop employee is thus able to specify the transaction which is being dealt with at present from this information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The display unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the POS terminal has, for example, an input unit such as a touch panel, and the shop employee touches the part of the screen displaying the receipt data for the transaction he or she is handling in order to select one receipt data (step S<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prints a receipt in accordance with the receipt data thus selected (step S<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is an example of a printed receipt. Information that is included in the receipt data mentioned above is printed on the receipt shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In a case of a settlement by credit card, a space for a signature is printed on the receipt. The shop employee asks the customer to sign the receipt, and, after comparing the signature on the credit card thus received against the signature on the receipt, gives the credit card, the receipt and the product to the customer. The transaction with the customer is thus complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prints a receipt, and sends back identification information for the receipt data thus selected (the terminal number and the transaction number, for example) to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), and the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> erases receipt data that corresponds to this identification information from the receipt data DB (step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). This is because receipt data thus printed as a receipt is then not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the present embodiment, in a case where a mobile terminal is used to perform a transaction with a customer, the mobile terminal creates receipt data and registers same on a server. Then, a POS terminal having a print function acquires this receipt data to print same in the form of a receipt, which means that it is possible to print a receipt for a transaction performed by means of a terminal device which does not have a print function. Since receipt data is stored on a server, in a case in which a plurality of POS terminals access the server, it is possible to print receipts from any of the POS terminals. Moreover, since receipt data is created by plural mobile terminals, the server searches for a transaction log required for the printing of a receipt from among a multiplicity of transaction logs that each contain a vast amount of data, and, in addition, since the server is therefore not burdened with the task of creating receipt data, the load on the server can thus be diminished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a second settlement processing flow chart according to the transaction system relating to the embodiment of the present invention. According to the second settlement processing, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not transmit receipt data to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, but instead, in accordance with a request from a POS terminal at the pay counter, the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> creates receipt data from a transaction log. For this reason, a transaction log newly contains print information (a print flag), and, since the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not print a receipt at the stage where same transmits a transaction log in relation to each transaction, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits a print flag OFF (not printed) transaction log to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, since the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits a transaction log to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> following the printing of a receipt, the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits a print flag ON (printing accomplished) transaction log to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The print flag may, for example, be attached to the header of the transaction log (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, since sale registration processing (S<highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) and payment registration processing (S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>) are the same as those described above, a description thereof will be omitted here. Following completion of payment registration processing, the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> creates a transaction log as described above (S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). At this time, a print flag contained in a transaction log created by a mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is in an OFF state. The mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits a transaction log to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> then stores this transaction log on the transaction log DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the same way described hereinabove, when a shop employee uses the mobile terminal <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to accomplish payment registration processing, the shop employee moves, accompanied by the customer, to a pay counter where a POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a print function is installed (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>{circle over (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>)}). The shop employee then operates the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> installed at the pay counter (touches the &ldquo;Receipt Data&rdquo; button on the screen) to request receipt data from the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving a receipt data request, the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> searches for a print flag OFF transaction log from within the transaction log DB. The server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> then extracts the information required for a receipt from among the print flag OFF transaction logs to thereby create receipt data (S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>). The constitution of the receipt data thus created is the same as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits receipt data thus created to the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> displays the receipt data received on the display unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). In this case also, when there is a plurality of receipt data, in order that one item of receipt data can be elected therefrom, the terminal number, the transaction number, and the total amount are displayed in this receipt data. When the shop employee touches the part of the screen displaying the receipt data for the transaction which he or she is taking charge of to thereby select one receipt data (S<highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>), the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> prints a receipt in accordance with the receipt data thus selected (S<highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Following printing of the receipt, the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends back the receipt data thus selected, that is, identification information for the transaction log (for example, the terminal number and the transaction number) to the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>), and the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> then sets the print flag of the transaction log corresponding to this identification information to an ON state (printing accomplished) (S<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in the embodiment described above, upon receiving a print flag OFF transaction log, the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may also automatically create receipt data and store same in the receipt data DB. At this time, when the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> creates receipt data from a print flag OFF transaction log, the print flag is set to an ON state. Then, the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> acquires receipt data from the receipt data DB, and, following the printing of a receipt, erases this receipt data from the receipt data DB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the server may also create the receipt data, but, in such a case, a print flag, which identifies whether or not receipt printing is accomplished, is contained in a transaction log, and the server judges whether or not receipt data is to be created in accordance with the state of this print flag. By setting the print flag in a transaction log, a search on the server for a transaction log required for receipt printing becomes straightforward, and the processing load on the server may thus be diminished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the transaction system according to the present embodiment, the device for the printing of receipts need not be a POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but may equally be a terminal device that has a print function and a communications function for communicating with the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (for example, a personal computer that is connected with a printer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In addition, the server <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be installed in a shop or may be installed in a location outside the shop such as in a center at the company headquarters. Further, a server to store receipt data and a server to store transaction logs may be separate from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the embodiment described hereinabove, a description has been provided in relation to settlement by credit card. However, the present invention may be applied equally to a debit card settlement using a cash card (bank card). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also, the transaction medium for the storage of card information that is personal information for a customer (a card number) is not limited to a credit card or a cash card, but may also be a transaction medium of a different form, for example (an IC memory or the like not shaped as a card, for instance). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the embodiment described hereinabove, a description has been provided in relation to the printing of receipts, but the present invention is not limited to receipts, being applicable also to the printing of other documents such as sales slips or vouchers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention hereinabove, in a case where a transaction with a customer is performed using a mobile terminal that has a settlement function, the mobile terminal creates receipt data and registers same on a server. Thereafter, a separate device, which has a print function, acquires this receipt data from the server to print same in the form of a receipt, which means that it is possible to print a receipt for a transaction performed by means of a mobile terminal which does not have a print function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The scope of protection of the present invention is not limited to the embodiment above and covers the inventions appearing in the claims for the patent, and equivalent items thereof. </paragraph>
