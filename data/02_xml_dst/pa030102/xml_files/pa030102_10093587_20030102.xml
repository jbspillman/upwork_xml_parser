<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A material not releasing gaseous organic substances during use is used as a filter medium and a sealing material for tightly sealing between the medium and a frame. Specifically, a synthetic paraffin not containing an aliphatic hydrocarbon having not more than 19 carbon atoms or less is used as a non-silicone type water repellent contained in a treatment agent for forming fibers into a cloth-like filter medium. A carboxylic acid ester having 400 or more molecular weight is used as a plasticizer and a phenolic compound having 300 or more molecular weight is used as an antioxidant to be added to the treatment agent and the sealing material. This enables that the gaseous organic substances are not present in a clean room, a semiconductor production apparatus or the like. Further, if the filter medium and the sealing material are formed of a material not releasing organic phosphorus compounds and boron compounds in the air, a clean room and a local facility particularly suitable for use in the production of semiconductors are provided. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns an air filter for use in a clean room used, for example, in factories or research laboratories relevant to the field of semiconductors, foodstuffs and biotechnology, a method of manufacturing thereof, a local facility and a clean room equipped with the air filter. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In clean rooms used heretofore, for example, in factories or research laboratories in the relevant field of semiconductors, foodstuffs, medicines and biotechnology, dry air filters for. trapping air-born particles are disposed to air introduction paths and air passing therethrough is. introduced into the clean room. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Air filters used at present in clean rooms include ULPA (abbreviation for Ultra Low Penetration Air.) using glass fibers for the filter medium and HEPA (abbreviation for High Efficiency Particle Air), and such filters are excellent filters in view of removal of dusts and, for example, ULPA filters can remove fine particles even of 0.1 &mgr;m. Further, non-glass type filters using fluoro resin or quartz fibers instead of the glass fibers for the filter medium have also been developed so as not to release inorganic substances from the air filters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, with the increase of integration degree of semiconductors, diffusing of gaseous organic substances as well as dusts in the clean room air have considered to be the cause of the defective. That is, it has been pointed out that organic substances are adsorbed on the surface of semiconductor substrates (silicon wafers) in clean rooms, to deteriorate device characteristics (for example, Fujii, &ldquo;Gaseous Contaminants and Current Situation for Countermeasure of Removal&rdquo;, Air Cleaning,, Vol. 32, No. 3, p 43 (1994), published from the Foundation of Japan Air Cleaning Society). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Further, it has been well-known that an n-type semiconductor is obtained by doping P (phosphorus) and a p-type semiconductor is obtained by doping B (boron, into a silicon-wafer in semiconductor manufacturing steps but, if phosphorus compounds or boron compounds are present in the clean room air., these may possibly cause unnecessary doping, so that it is necessary to remove such ingredients from the clean room air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been accomplished to solve the problems described above and it is an object thereof to provide an air filter for trapping air-born particles that can eliminate the presence of gaseous organic substances, for example, in clean rooms semiconductor production apparatus or the like, a method of manufacturing an air filter therefor, a treatment agent constituting the air filter, a method of manufacturing, a filter medium, a clean r6om and a local facility such as a semiconductor production apparatus in which gaseous organic substances are not present, as well as a clean room and a local facility in which phosphorus compounds and boron compounds are not present. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have made earnest studies for attaining the foregoing-object and, as a result, have accomplished the present invention based on the finding that presence of gaseous organic substances in a clean room and a local facility such as a semiconductor production apparatus is mainly caused by air filters disposed to air introduction paths and gaskets intervened for attaching the air filters to openings, for example, of a ceiling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> That is, it has been found by the study of the present inventors that gaseous organic substances such as cyclosiloxanes, carboxylic acid esters, phosphoric acid esters, hydrocarbons, and phenols are released from the existent air, filters described above and that such organic substances are released from treatment agents impregnated between each of fibers upon forming the fibers into a cloth-like filter medium (including a binder for binding fibers, a water repellent for improving dust trapping effect and a plasticizer or an antioxidant), silicone oils deposited to fibers in a case where the filter medium is glass fibers (this is a reinforcing material upon spinning glass fibers which serves also as a water repellent of the filter medium) and sealing materials for bonding a filter medium and a frame. Further, it has also been found that organic substances are detected at a high ratio also from rubber materials used so far as gaskets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Specifically, it has been found that the ingredient of the conventional water repellent (non-silicone type) in the treatment agent is liquid paraffins (aliphatic hydrocarbon having 12 to 18.carbon atoms) which contain a plasticizer or an antioxidant of relatively low molecular weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Further, while the sealing material comprising a polyurethane or epoxy type resin as the main ingredient is used, .it has been found that isocyanates of the main agent left after the curing reaction become organic contaminations in a case of a two component polyurethane resin, while amine compounds used as a curing agent become organic contaminations in a case of a two component epoxy resin. It has also been found that conventional sealing materials contain plasticizers and antioxidants of relatively low molecular weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Based on the findings described above, the present invention provides an air filter comprising a filter medium formed of fibers treated with a treatment agent into a cloth-like shape, a frame for containing the filter medium and a sealing material for tightly sealing a portion between the frame and the filter medium for trapping air-born particles, wherein at least one of the filter medium and the sealing material does not release gaseous organic substances during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides an air filter satisfying one of the following definitions (a)-(c) and (e)-(g) for the treatment agent and the sealing material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing an air filter which comprises selectively using the plasticizer and the antioxidant defined in (b), (c), (e) and (f) for the treatment agent and the sealing agent described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Now, if the main ingredient of the non-silicone type water repellent in (a) and the main ingredient of the lubricant in (g) are an aliphatic hydrocarbon having 19 carbon atoms or less and a higher alcohol having 17 carbon atoms or less, the gaseous substances are present in the clean room air being entrained by air passing through the air filter in a usual clean room, which is controlled at a temperature of 23&deg; C. and at a humidity of 30-40% and in which the flow rate of air passing through the air filter is about. 0.3 to 0.4 m/s, but such gaseous substances are not present in the clean room air when an aliphatic hydrocarbon having 20 carbon atoms or more and a higher alcohol 18 having carbon atoms or more is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Further, if the main ingredient of the plasticizer in (b) and (e) is dibutyl phthalate (molecular weight 278), dioctyl phthalate (molecular weight 391) or di-2-ethylhexyl adipate (.molecular weight 371) having 400 or more molecular weight, the gaseous substances are present in the clean room air being entrained by air passing through the air filter in the usual clean room, but the-gaseous substances are not present in the clean room air if those having 400 or more molecular weight are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Further, if the main ingredient of the antioxidant in (c) and (f) is 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol (molecular weight. 220.4) having 300 or more molecular weight, the gaseous substances are present in the clean room air being entrained by air passing through the air filter in the usual clean room, but the gaseous substances are not present in the clean room air if those having 400 or more molecular weight are used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As actual examples of (c) and (f), there can be mentioned stearyl-&bgr;-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydrbxyphenyl) propionate (molecular weight: 520.9), 2,2&prime;-methylene-bis (4-methyl-6-t-butylphenol) (molecular weight: 340.5), 2,2&prime;methylene-bis&prime;(4-ethyl-6-t-butylphenol) (molecular weight 368.54), 4,4&prime;-thiobis (3-methyl-B-t-butylphenol) (molecular weight: 358-5), 4,4&prime;-butylidene-bis (3-methyl-6-t-butyl-phenol) (molecular weight: 382.6), 1,1,3-tris (2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-t-butylphenyl) butane (molecular weight: 544.8), 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,-4,6-tris (3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) benzene (molecular weight: 775.2), tetrakis (methylene-3(3&prime;5&prime;-.di-t-butyl-4&prime;-hydroxyphenyl) propionate methane (molecular weight: 1177.7), bis (3,3&prime;-bis W-hydroxy-3&prime;-t-butylphenyl) butiric acid) glycol ester (molecular weight: 1177.7) and tocophenol (molecular weight: 794.4). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, the present inventors have found that as the molecular weight of the organic substance is greater, the volatility is lowered and the adsorption property is increased, but the adsorption amount to the silicon wafer is decreased and restricted if the molecular weight increases to more than a predetermined amount and, that the predetermined amount is different depending on the molecular structure, and definitions for the numerical values in (a)-(c) and (e)-(g) described above were determined based on the result of experiment.conducted for a number of targeted materials respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The air filter according to the present invention may be such one as satisfying at least one of the definitions (a)-(c) and (e)-(g) described above, but those satisfying all of them are preferred since no gaseous organic substances are not released from all of the constituent materials of the air filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Specifically, preferred are those in which the main ingredient of the non-silicone type water repellent is microcrystalline wax, the main ingredient of the plasticizer contained in the non-silicone series water repellent is tri-2-ethylhexyl trimellitate, the main ingredient of the antiox 1 dant contained in the non-silicone type water repellent is 2,2&prime;-methylene-bis (4-ethyl-6-t-butylphenol), the main ingredient of the plasticizer contained in the sealing material is di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate, the main ingredient of the antioxidant contained in the.sealing material is 2,2&prime;methylene-bis (4-ethyl-6-t-butylphenol) and the main ingredient of the lubricant contained in the sealing material is synthesis paraffin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides an air filter which satisfies at least one of the definitions (a)-(c) and (e)-(d) described above, in which the main ingredient of the sealing material is a two component polyurethane resin formed by reaction between a main agent comprising a polyisocyanate and a curing agent, and the equivalent amount of active hydrogen.in the curing agent is more than the equivalent amount of the isocyanate as the main agent and which contains no phosphoric acid ester. In the air filter, since the isocyanates of the main agent do not remain after the curing reaction of the sealing material, isocyanates and diamines caused by reaction of the isocyanate with water in the air are not formed, and since phosphoric acid ester is not released, release of gaseous organic substances from the sealing material is further suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides an air filter which satisfies at least one of the definitions (a).-(c) and (e)-(g) described above and in which the main ingredient for the sealing material is a two component epoxy resin formed by the reaction between the main ingredient and the curing agent, and the curing agent is acidic or neutral. In the air filter, since a basic amine compound as the curing agent of the sealing material is not contained in the air filter, release of the gaseous organic substances from the sealing material is further suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides an air.filter whichsatisfies at least one of the definitions (a)-(c) and (e)-(g) described above and in which the main ingredient of the sealing material is a two component epoxy resin formed by the reaction between the main agent and the curing agent is of an amine type and the residual amine is reduced. As the means for reducing the residual amine, there can be mentioned blending and curing such that the amine equivalent is slightly lower than the epoxy equivalent thereby leaving no residual amine after curing, or heating of the resin after curing thereby volatiling the residual amine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides an air filter which satisfies at least one of the definitions (a)-(c) and (e)-(g) described above and in which the filter medium is formed into a cloth-like shape by treating silicone-oil deposited glass fibers with a treatment agent and the silicone oil does not contain cyclosiloxanes having 10 silicon atom or less. Since cyclosiloxanes having 10 silicon atoms or lessare adsorbed extremely easily to the silicon wafer, this filter is suitable, particularly, to an air filter used for a clean room for use in semiconductor production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing an air filter including a first step of depositing an silicone oil to glass fibers and a second step of treating the glass fibers with a treatment agent after the first step thereby forming a cloth-like filter medium, which comprises subjecting the glass fibers after the first step to a heat treatment in, a clean air stream, thereby sufficiently removing siloxanes having 10 silicon atoms or less from the silicone oil deposited to the glass fibers and then applying a treatment by a treatment agent not releasing gaseous organic substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> This is one of methods for manufacturing the air filter, in which siloxanes having 10 silicon atoms or less contained in the silicone oil can be removed sufficiently by putting the glass fibers deposited with the silicon oil in a tightly closed vessel and heating, for example, at 120&deg; C. for several hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing an air filter including a first step of depositing a silicon oil to glass filters and a second step of treating the glass fibers with a treatment agent, after the first step into a cloth-like filter medium which comprises using those removed with cyclosiloxane having 10 silicon atoms or less as the silicone oil used in the fir st step and treating them by a treatment agent not forming gaseous organic substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> This is one of methods for manufacturing the air filter, and siloxanes having 10 silicon atoms or less contained in the silicone oil can be eliminated sufficiently by removing low boiling ingredients by heating, for example, at 200&deg; C. in a vacuum state (for example, at vacuum degree of 5 mHg). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a clean room equipped one of air filters each described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a local facility equipped with one of air filters each described above. The local facility means, for example, a clean booth disposed to a place where cleanness is intended to be increased locally, or a production facility requiring a predetermined cleanness, for example, a semiconductor production apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention provides a clean room, in which walls and floors are fabricated with building materials releasing gaseous organic substances in an amount of 50 &mgr;g per 1 g or less measured by a purge &amp; trap method, and one of the air filters described above is attached by interposing, between the air filter and an opening used for attachment, a, gasket not releasing gaseous organic substances in an amount of 50 &mgr;g per 1 g or less measured by the purge &amp; trap method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the walls and the floors of the clean room and the gaskets for attaching the air filters are constituted with materials releasing gaseous organic substances in an amount of 50 &mgr;g per 1 g or less measured. by the purge &amp; trap method, the clean room can be reliably put to a state in which the organic substances are not released in a usual operation state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> If the clean room is used, for example, in a semiconductor production factory, it is possible that the organic substances are scarcely adsorbed to the silicone wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The purge &amp; trap method is a method of passing an inert gas at a predetermined temperature (a temperature at which all the organic ingredients can be volatile) to a predetermined amount of a material, evaporating all the gaseous organic ingredients contained in the specimen, trapping them and quantitatively determining the amount of the gaseous organic substances released from the trapped ingredient. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Clean rooms were fabricated by using each of the blower filter units, forming wall materials by dry-sealing of partitions finished by bake coating, and forming floor materials by using stainless steel sheets as the surface material of a free access floor. The amount of organic substances released was 0.1 &mgr;g/g or less both for the wall materials and the floor materials according to the analysis by the P&amp;T-(Dynamic headspace) method described above. After 3 days operation of the clean rooms, silicon wafers of 6 inch diameter were placed and-left for 6 hours in it, and the amount and the kind of the organic substances adsorbed on the wafer were analyzed by using the following SWA device. The results are also shown collectively in each of the tables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> &lt;Analysis by SWA Device&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The SWA device is a silicon wafer analyzer (trade name of products) manufactured by G. L. Science Co. having the following trap device, TCT (Thermal Desorption Cold Trap Injector) device, and GC/MS device. The trap device is adapted to desorb materials adsorbed on the surface of a wafer and collect desorbed ingredients. The TCT&apos;device is adapted to heat the ingredients collected by the trap device to 300&deg; C. in a helium gas stream, then introduce them into a capillary tube cooled to &minus;130&deg; C. by liquid nitrogen and collect them under cooling. The ingredients collected by the TCT device are rapidly heated to 300&deg; C. in a helium gas stream and introduced into the GC/MS device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Referring to the GC/MS device used herein, the GC device is HP-5890A and MS devices is HP-5971A. HP-5 (25 mnm length, 0.2 mm. inner diameter, 0.33 &mgr;m film thickness) is used for the column of the GC device and temperature condition upon measurement by the GC device is as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Initial temperature 80&deg; C. (kept for 10 min) temperature elevation at a rate of 7&deg; C./min final temperature 300&deg; C. (kept for 10 min). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Other procedures than the above are identical with those in the P&amp;T (Dynamic headspace)-GC/MS -Method, by which the content and the kind of the organic substances adsorbed on the wafer surface are measured. According to this method., analysis is possible to the order of several ng (10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>g) per one wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the results, in Nos. 1-5 and Nos. 10 and 11 corresponding to each of the embodiments of the present invention, gaseous organic substances present in the clean room can be reduced and the amount of the organic substances adsorbed to the silicon wafer placed in the clean room can be reduced to less than {fraction (1/10)} compared with the case of a conventional ULPA filter (No. 6) or a filter using a plasticizers and antioxidants, etc. of lower molecular weight (Nos. 7-9, 12). Also, the dust removing efficiency dusts is higher than 99.999%, which does not deteriorate the performance as the air filter. </paragraph>

The detection limit value of the quantitative analysis for the organic phosphorous compound by the method described above is 1.0 &mgr;g/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> (Method of Analyzing Boron Content) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A cut out specimen was immersed in a predetermined amount of ultra-pure water (specific resistivity of higher than 18.6 M&OHgr;) for 28 days, the ultra-pure water was introduced into an ICP/MS device (model HP-4500 of Hewlett Packard Co.), inorganic substances leached out in the ultra-pure water were analyzed and the content of boron was determined quantitatively by using a calibration curve prepared for an aqueous boric acid at a known concentration. The detection limit value for the quantitative analysis by the method is 0.1 &mgr;g/g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> (Evaluation of Clean Room) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In each of the clean rooms, external air (fresh air) passing the prefilters and return air from the inside of the clean room were mixed and sent to a chamber at the back of the ceiling, and then passed through the ULPA filters at the ceiling and supplied into the clean room, in which the mixing ratio between the return air and the fresh air was set to 10:1. Then, each of the clean rooms was operated continuously for two weeks at an air flow rate at the exit from the ULPA filter to 0.40 m/s, at a temperature of 23&deg; C. and at a relative humidity of 40%, in an unattended state with nothing being placed at the inside and, subsequently, air in each of the clean rooms was taken out to analyze organic substances and inorganic substances contained in the air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> For the analysis of the organic substances, 40 liter of air in the clean room were introduced into a TENAX tube (trade name of Chromepack Co.) thereby adsorbing organic ingredients contained in the air. Then, the TENAX tube was installed to a TCT device (refer to Example 1), the organic ingredients adsorbed to the TENAX tube were taken o ut by the TCT device, heated and then introduced into the GC/MS device. The detection limit value for the quantitative analysis by this method is-10 ng/m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Inorganic substances were analyzed by introducing air in the clean room at a flow rate of 10 liter per min for 24 hours into an impinger containing 200 ml of ultra-pure water (specific resistivity of higher than 18.6 M&OHgr;), leaching the inorganic ingredients contained in the air into the ultra-pure water, and introducing the ultra-pure water into the ICP/MS device (model HP-4500 of Hewlett Packard Co.). The detection limit value for the quantitative analysis by this method is 20 ng/m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The results for each of the analyses are also shown collectively in Tables 4 and 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the results, in the clean rooms of Nos. 21-24 corresponding to the embodiments of the present invention, analysis values for the organic phosphorus compounds and the boron compounds in the clean room air are below the detection limit values. Since the organic phosphorous compounds and the boron compounds are not present in the air at the inside of the clean rooms, such clean rooms are particularly suitable as those used for semiconductor production. On the contrary, the clean rooms Nos. 25-28 corresponding to the comparative examples of the present invention are not preferred since either the organic phos-phorus compounds or the boron compounds are present in the clean room air, and Ithere is a worry of causing unnecessary doping as the clean room for semiconductor production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In this Example 2, the ULPA filter is attached to the opening of the clean room ceiling without using the gasket. When an urethane rubber type gasket is used, it is desirable to use a phosphoric acid ester having 300 or more molecular weight as the liquefying material for diphenyl methane isocyanate, like that in the sealing material for securing the filter medium to the frame. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The wall material, the filter medium for the air filter (ULPA filter) and the sealing material for securing the filter medium and the frame of the air filter were used in the combination shown in Table 6 to fabricate each of local facilities for use in semiconductor production apparatus. Each of the constituent materials was analyzed in the same manner as in Example 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Then, each of the local facilities was placed in No. 21 clean room in Example 2 and air in the clean room (fresh air and return air mixed and passed through the ULPA filter in the clean room) was introduced into the ULPA filter of the local facility for Nos. 31 and 33. Further, for Nos. 32 and 34, only the fresh air was introduced into the ULPA filter of the local facility. In this way, after continuous two week operation of each of the local facilities in No. 21 clean room under the conditions described above, air in each of the local facilities was taken out and the organic substances and inorganic substances contained in the air were analyzed in the same manner as in Example 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The results for each analysis were also shown in Table 6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the results, in the local facilities of Nos. 31 and 33 corresponding to the embodiments of the present invention, analysis values for the organic phosphorus compounds and the boron compounds in the air at the inside of the local facilities are below the detection limit values and, since the organic phosphorus compounds and ,the boron compounds are not present in the local facilities, such local facilities are particularly suitable as the local facility for use in semiconductor production. On the contrary, the local facilities of Nos. 32 and 34 corresponding to the comparative examples of the present invention are not desired, since either the organic phosphorus compounds or the boron compounds are present in the air at the inside of the local facilities and there if a worry of causing unnecessary doping-for the local facility used in the semiconductor production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Also in this Example 3, the ULPA filter is attached to the ceiling opening of the local facility without using gaskets. In a case of using urethane rubber type gaskets, it is desirable to use a phosphoric acid ester having 300 or more weight as the liquefying material for the diphenyl methane isocyanate like that in the sealing4material for securing the filter medium to the frame.
