<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A portable isocapnia circuit and an isocapnia method. A breathing port of the circuit allows a subject to inhale and exhale. Connected to the breathing port, a bifurcate conduit has a first conduit branch and a second conduit branch. The first conduit branch has an atmospheric air inlet, from which the atmospheric air is provided for inhalation, an inspiratory check valve to allow a one-way flow of the atmospheric air, and an atmospheric air aspirator. The second conduit branch has a one-way expiratory check valve and a expiratory gas reservoir. A one-way check valve is used to interconnect the first and second conduit branch, from which the expiratory gas stored in the expiratory gas reservoir flows to the first conduit branch to mix with the atmospheric air when the minute ventilation exceeds the atmospheric air. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a portable isocapnia circuit and a method to set and stablize end tidal and arterial PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>despite varying levels of minute ventilation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Venous blood returns to the heart from the muscles and organs partially depleted of oxygen (O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and a full complement of carbon dioxide (CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). Blood from various parts of the body is mixed in the right side of the heart (resulting in the formation of mixed venous blood) and pumped into the lungs. In the lungs the blood vessels break up into a net of small vessels surrounding tiny lung sacs (alveoli). The vessels surrounding the alveoli provide a large surface area for the exchange of gases by diffusion along their concentration gradients. A concentration gradient exists between the partial pressure of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(PCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) in the mixed venous blood (PvCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and that in the alveolar PCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>diffuses into the alveoli from the mixed venous blood from the beginning of inspiration until an equilibrium is reached between the PvCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the alveolar PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at some time during breath. When the subject exhales, the first gas that is exhaled comes from the trachea and major bronchi which do not allow gas exchange and therefore will have a gas composition similar to that of inhaled gas. The gas at the end of exhalation is considered to have come from the alveoli and reflects the equilibrium CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentration between the capillaries and the alveoli. The PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in this gas is the end-tidal PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(PETCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When blood passes the alveoli and is pumped to the left side of the heart to the arteries in the rest of the body, it is known as the arterial PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(PaCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The arterial blood has a PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>equal to the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at equilibrium between the capillaries and alveoli. With each breath some CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is eliminated from the lung and fresh air containing little or no CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentration is assumed to be 0%) is inhaled and dilutes the residual alveolar PCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, establishing a new gradient for CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to diffuse out of the mixed venous blood into the alveoli. The flow of fresh gas in and out of the lungs each minute, or minute ventilation (V), expressed in L/min, is that required to eliminate the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>brought to the lungs and maintain an equilibrium PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and (PaCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) of approximately 40 mmHg (in normal humans). When one produces more CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(for example, as a result of fever or exercise), more CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is produced and carried to the lungs. When CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>production is normal, the PaCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>falls if one increases the ventilation (hyperventilation). On the contrary, when CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>production remains normal, the PaCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>rises if one increases the ventilation (hypoventilation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is important to note that not all V contributes to elimination of CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Some V goes air passage (trachea and major bronchi) and alveoli with little blood perfusing them, and thus contributes minimally to eliminating CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. This V is termed &ldquo;dead space&rdquo; ventilation and gas in the lung that has not participated in gas exchange with the blood is called &ldquo;dead space&rdquo; gas. That portion of V that goes to well-perfused alveoli and participates in gas exchange is called the alveolar ventilation (VA) and exhaled gas that has participated in gas exchange in the alveoli is termed &ldquo;alveolar gas&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A method of accelerating the resuscitation of a patient has been disclosed in PCT application No. WO98/41266 filed by Joe Fisher. When the patient breathes at a rate such that his ventilation is less than or equal to the fresh gas flowing into the fresh glowing into the circuit, all of the inhaled gas is made up of fresh gas. When the patient&apos;s minute ventilation exceeds the fresh gas flow, the inhaled gas is made up of all of the fresh gas and the additional gas is provided by &ldquo;reserve gas&rdquo; consisting of fresh gas plus CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>such that the concentration of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in the reserve gas of about 6% has a PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>equal to the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in the mixed venous blood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The limitation of the above method is that a source of reserve gas and its delivery apparatus must be supplied to pursue the method. The reserve gas must be at about 6% of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentration substantially having a PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>equal to that of mixed venous blood or about 46 mmHg. The portability is thus limited since a sufficiently long tubular structure, typically about 3 m, is required to prevent the atmospheric air from diffusing in and diluting the expired CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentrations. While climbing at high altitude, it would be very difficult to carry oxygen tanks and a long tubular expired gas reservoir. Another example of such a difficulty would be when preventing hyperventilation while ventilating with air in the course of resuscitating newborns and adults in out-of-hospital setting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a isocapnia circuit that maintains a constant PCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. A flexible container is used to replace the fresh gas reservoir bag used in the prior art. The flexible container is actively collapsed by the inspiratory effort of the patient during inspiration and passively expands during expiration, the atmospheric air is thus drawn into the flexible container and the circuit through a port. The expiratory reservoir is provided with a flexible bag so that the volume of expired gas rebreathed is displaced by collapse of the bag rather than entrainment of atmospheric air, thus preventing the dilution of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in the expired gas reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the benefits of controlling the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at a constant level are reaped and the expense and inconvenience of supplying fresh gas are not incurred. The compact nature of the isocapnia circuit makes its use practical outdoors, during physical activity and in remote environments. It has been determined that people living at high altitude such as mountaineers, miners, astronomical observatory personnel would benefit from preventing the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>level falling excessively as a result of the involuntary tendency to hyperventilate while they are at high altitude. It would also been determined that resuscitation of newborns with air has demonstrable advantages over resuscitation with oxygen if excessive decrease in PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be prevented. This therefore was not contemplated in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the invention, the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is controlled at a predetermined desired level without the need of gas from another source flowing into the circuit under pressure. The expired gas is stored to prevent dilution with atmospheric air such that alveolar portion of the expired gas is rebreathed in preference to dead space gas. The improved breathing circuit can be used to assist patients who are or run the risk of suffering the effects of high altitudes sickness, or who have suffered a cardiac arrest, or who have suffered from an interruption of blood flow to an organ or region of an organ and are at risk of suffering oxidative injury on restoration of blood perfusion as would occur with a stroke or heart attack or resuscitation of the newborn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the method of providing a constant PCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. atmospheric air is aspirated from an inspiratory side to a patient when the patient inhales through the inspiratory side. A gas exhaled by the patient is accumulated in an expiratory gas reservoir connected to an expiratory side, through which the patient exhale. The gas exhaled by the patient and stored in the expiratory gas reservoir is allowed flowing into the inspiratory side to mix with the aspirated atmospheric air when a minute ventilation of the patient exceeds the atmospheric air aspirated to the inspiratory side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The above isocapnia circuit comprises a breathing port, through which a subject inhales and exhales; an inspiratory port, communicating to the breathing port with an inspiratory valve that allows air flowing to the breathing port and prevents air flowing from the breathing port to the inspiratory port, the inspiratory port having an atmospheric air aspirator to aspirate the atmospheric air therein; an expiratory port, communicating to the breathing port with an expiratory valve that allows air flowing from the breathing port to the expiratory port and prevents air flowing to the breathing port, the expiratory port having an expiratory gas reservoir to store a gas exhaled by the subject flowing across the expiratory valve; and a bypass conduit, communicating the inspiratory and expiratory ports with a bypass valve, the bypass valve allows a one-way flow of air from the expiratory port to the inspiratory port with a pressure differential applied thereto.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an air isocapnia circuit. The isocapnia circuit has a Y-piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, through one breathing port of which, the patient or subject breathes (inhales and exhales). In addition to the breathing port, the isocapnia circuit has another two ports in a form of two limbs of the Y-piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and each of them comprises a one-way valve. One of the limbs with an inspiratory valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> functions as an inspiration port, while the other limb with an expiratory valve <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> functions as an expiration port. The inspiratory valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> directs gas to flow towards the patient when the patient makes an inspiratory effort, and acts as a check valve preventing flow in the opposite direction during exhalation. The expiratory valve <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> allows gas to exit the Y-piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> when the patient exhales, and also acts as a check valve to prevent flow towards the patient when the patient inhales. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Distal to the expiratory limb of the Y-piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a large bore tubing termed &ldquo;alveolar gas reservoir&rdquo; <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached. The alveolar gas reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is contained in a pliable bag of about 3 L in volume. The pliable bag, named &ldquo;expiratory gas reservoir bag&rdquo; <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, has a proximal end sealed around a proximal end of the alveolar gas reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The expiratory gas reservoir bag <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> further has another tubing called the &ldquo;exhaust tubing&rdquo; <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> situated at a distal end where the expired gas exits to atmosphere <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Thus arranged, most of the exhaust tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is contained in the expiratory gas reservoir bag <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and which is sealed to the circumference of the exhaust tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at its distal end. Preferably, the exhaust tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a diameter smaller than that of the alveolar gas reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the alveolar gas reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is about 35 mm in diameter, and has a length to provide a total volume of about or greater than 0.3 while being applied to an average (70 kg) adult. The inspiratory limb opens into a cylindrical container comprising a rigid proximal end plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a collapsible plicate tube <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extending distally from the circumference of the proximate end plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and a distal end rigid plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> sealing the distal end of the collapsible plicate tube <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. When not in use, the collapsible plicate tube <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is kept open by the gravitation of the distal end rigid plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and/or by the force of a spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> attached on the collapsible plicate tube <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and/or by intrinsic recoil of the plicate tubing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The inspiratory limb is also open to the atmosphere by means of a nozzle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to which a tube <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is attached. The rigid plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is open to a nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, to which another tube <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is attached. The proximal end plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a protuberance <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> pointing at the tube <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the internal opening of the distal end plate nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The combination of the proximal end plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the collapsible plicate tube <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the distal end rigid plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the inspiratory limb nozzle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the tube <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> attached to the nozzle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the distal end plate nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the tube <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> attached to the distal end plate nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the protuberance <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are in aggregate as am &ldquo;atmosphere air aspirator (AAA)&rdquo;. A bypass conduit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is further included in the Y-piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to connect the expiratory limb and the inspiratory limb. The opening of the bypass conduit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is preferably as close as possible to the expiratory valve <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The bypass conduit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has a one-way valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> allowing flow from the expiratory limb to the inspiratory limb only. The one-way valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the bypass conduit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> requires an opening pressure differential slightly greater than the pressure difference between the inspiratory limb pressure and atmospheric pressure that is sufficient to collapse the plicate tube <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this way, during inspiration, atmosphere air contained in the atmospheric air aspirator and the air being continuously aspirated into the inspiratory limb is preferentially drawn from the inspiratory manifold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Considering the above isocapnia circuit without the spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on the distal end plate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, or the internally directed protuberance <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, each inspiration drawn initially from the atmospheric air aspirator collapses the plicate tube <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and approximates the distal end plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the proximal end plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> when the patient begins to breathe. As long as the plicate tube <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is partially collapsed, there is a constant sub-atmospheric pressure in the inspiratory limb of the isocapnia circuit. The sub-atmospheric pressure creates a pressure gradient that draws the atmospheric air into the inspiratory limb of the isocapnia circuit through the nozzle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the tube <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. When the minute ventilation of the subject is equal to or less than the intended flow of atmospheric air into the aspirator, only atmospheric air is breathed. During exhalation, atmospheric air accumulates in the aspirator. During inhalation, inspired gas consist of the contents of the atmospheric air aspirator and the atmospheric air flowing into the inspiratory limb through the nozzle <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. When the minute ventilation of the subject exceeds the net flow of the atmospheric air into the isocapnia circuit, air is breathed for each breath until the atmospheric air aspirator is collapsed. Additional inspiratory efforts result in an additional decrease in gas pressure on the inspiratory side of the isocapnia circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When the pressure differential across the valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the bypass conduit <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> exceeds its opening pressure, the one-way valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> opens and the exhaled gas is drawn back from the expiratory reservoir bag <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the inspiratory limb of the Y-piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and hence to the patient. To the extent that the opening pressure of the valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is close to the pressure generated by the recoil of the atmospheric air aspirator, there will be little change in the flow of atmospheric air into the isocapnia circuit during inspiration after the atmospheric air aspirator has collapsed. The last gas to be exhaled during the previous breath, termed &ldquo;alveolar gas&rdquo;, is retained in the alveolar gas reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is the first gas to be drawn back into the inspiratory limb of the isocapnia circuit and inhaled (rebreathed) by the patient. After several breaths, the rest of the expired gas from the expiratory gas reservoir bag <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> contains mixed expired gas. The mixed expired gas from the expiratory gas reservoir bag <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> replace the gas drawn from the alveolar gas reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and provides the balance of the inspired volume required to meet the inspiratory effort of the patient. The greater restriction in the diameter of the second tube, that is, the exhaust tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, than in the alveolar gas reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> results in the gas being drawn into the alveolar gas reservoir <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> being displaced by the collapse of the expiratory gas reservoir bag <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in preference to drawing air from the ambient atmosphere. The exhaust tubing in the expiratory reservoir bag <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides a route for exhaust of expired gas and acts as a reservoir for that volume of atmospheric air diffusing into the expiratory reservoir bag through the distal opening, tending to keep such atmospheric air separate from the mixed expired gas contained in the expiratory gas reservoir bag <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> During exhalation and all of inhalation until the collapse of the atmospheric gas aspirator, the flow of atmospheric air into the circuit will remain constant. However, after the atmospheric air aspirator collapses, the pressure gradient will increase. The effect of the increase in total flow will depend on the difference between the opening pressure of the bypass valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the recoil pressure of the atmospheric air aspirator times the fraction of the respiratory cycle when the atmospheric air aspirator is collapsed. If the fraction of the respiratory cycle when the atmospheric air aspirator is collapsed is great, as when there is a very great excess minute ventilation above the rate of atmospheric air aspiration, the atmospheric air aspirator can be modified adding a second port for air entry at, for example, the distal end plate nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As a result, the total flow from the two ports provides the desired total flow of air into the circuit under the recoil pressure of the atmospheric air aspirator. When the atmospheric air aspirator collapses on inspiration, the second port <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is occluded by the protuberance <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The remaining port, that is, the nozzle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, provides a greater resistance to air flow to offset the greater pressure gradient being that gradient required to open the bypass valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, it is assumed that the gravitation acting on the distal plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides the recoil pressure to open the atmospheric air aspirator. The disadvantage to this configuration is that the distal end plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> must be heavy enough to generate the sub-atmospheric pressure. This may be too heavy to be supported by attachment to a face mask strapped to the face. Furthermore, movement such as walking or running or spasmodic inhalation will cause variations in the pressure inside the atmospheric air aspirator and hence variation in flow of air into the atmospheric air aspirator. In such cases, it is better to minimize the mass of the distal end plate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and use a different type of motive force to provide recoil symbolized by the spring <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the isocapnia circuit and method provided by the invention in terms of the operation and portability are clearly evident from the data charted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, in which levels of minute ventilation, expired gas flow and airway PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are compared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the above isocapnia circuit is installed in a case to render it fully portable. Ths case may include the appropriate number of capped ports to allow proper set up and use of the isocapnia circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The operation of the above isocapnia circuit is described as follows. When the minute ventilation for the patient breathing through the breathing port is equal to the rate of atmospheric air aspirated into the isocapnia circuit, for example, 5 L per minute, the atmospheric air enters the breathing port from the first conduit branch, that is, the inspiratory limb, at a predetermined rate, preferably, 5 L per minute and is exhaled through the second conduit branch, that is, the expiratory limb, at a rate of preferably 5 L per minute. The exhaled gas travels down to the expiratory gas reservoir bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. When the minute ventilation exceeds the aspirated atmospheric air, the patient inhales the expiratory gas retained in the expiratory gas reservoir bag <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The expiratory gas passes through the bypass valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the inspiratory limb to make up the shortfall of the atmospheric air. In this way, the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is maintained with a constant value even when the minute ventilation increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To maintain the constant value of PCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, it is important to have atmospheric air aspirator depleted of gas first until it is just empty at the end of an inhalation cycle. Once the minute ventilation is increased, the increased breathing effort will further decrease the sub-atmospheric pressure in the inspiratory limb and open the bypass valve <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to allow the expiratory gas supplied as a part of the breathing gas during the entire breathing cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> During resuscitation of an asphyxiated newborn or an adult suffering a cardiac arrest, the blood flow through the lungs is remarkably slow during resuscitation attempts. Even normal rates of ventilation may result an excessive elimination of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>from the blood. As the blood reaches brain, the low PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>may constrict the blood vessels and limit the potential blood flow to the ischemic brain. By attaching the isocapnia circuit provided by the invention to the gas inlet port of a resuscitation bag and diverting all expiratory gas to the expiratory gas reservoir bag, the decrease of PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>would be limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The above isocapnia circuit can be applied to enhance the results of a diagnostic procedure or a medical treatment including the following steps. The circuit without a source of forced gas glow and capable of organizing exhaled gas is used. With the circuit, preferential rebreathing of alveolar gas in preference to dead space gas is provided when the patient is ventilating at a rate greater than the rate of atmospheric air aspirated, and when inducing hypercapnia is desired. By decreasing the rate of aspirated atmospheric air, a corresponding increase in rebreathed gas is passively provided to prevent the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>level of arterial blood from dropping despite increase in minute ventilation. The step of inducing hypercapnia is continued until the diagnostic or medical therapeutic procedure is complete. The results of the diagnostic or medical procedure are thus enhanced by carrying out the method in relation to the results of the procedure had the method not been carried out. Examples of such procedures include MRI or preventing spasm of brain vessels after brain hemorrhage, radiation treatments or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The invention can also be applied to treat or assist a patient, preferably human, during a traumatic event characterized by hyperventilation. A circuit that does not required a source of forced gas flow, in which alveolar ventilation is equal to the rate of atmospheric air aspirated and increases in alveolar ventilation with increases in minute ventilation is prevented, is provided. The circuit, for example, the isocapnia circuit as described above, is capable of organizing exhaled gas provided to the patient preferential rebreathing alveolar gas in preference to dead space gas following ventilating the patient at a rate of normal minute ventilation, preferably approximately <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>L per minute. When desired, hypercapnia is induced to increase arterial PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and prevent the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>level of arterial blood from dropping. The normocapnia is maintained despite the ventilation is increased until the traumatic hyperventilation is complete. As a result, the effects of hyperventilation experienced during the traumatic event are minimized. This can be applied when the mother is in labor and becomes light headed or the baby during the delivery is effected with the oxygen delivery to its brain being decreased as a result of contraction of the blood vessels in the placenta and fetal brain. A list of circumstances in which the method enhancing the diagnostic procedure results or the experience of the traumatic even are listed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Applications of the method and circuit includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 1) Maintenance of constant PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and inducing changes in PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>during MRI. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> f) protection of various organs such as the lung, kidney and brain during states of multi-organ failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> 3) Prevention of hypocapnia with O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>therapy, especially in pregnant patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 4) Other applications where O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>therapy is desired and it is important to prevent the accompanying drop in PCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> When minute ventilation is greater than or equal to the rate of atmospheric air aspirated, the above-mentioned preferred circuit ensures that the patient receives all the atmospheric air aspirated into the circuit independent of the pattern of breathing since atmospheric air alone enters the fresh gas reservoir, and exhaled gas enters its own separate reservoir and all the aspirated air is delivered to the patient during inhalation before rebreathed exhaled gas. The atmospheric air aspirator is large enough not to fill to capacity during a prolonged exhalation when the total minute ventilation exceeds the rate of atmospheric air aspiration ensuring that under these circumstances atmospheric air continues to enter the circuit uninterrupted during exhalation. The preferred circuit prevents rebreathing at a minute ventilation equal to the rate of air being aspirated into the atmospheric air aspirator because the check valve in the interconnecting conduit does not open to allow rebreathing of previously exhaled gas unless a sub-atmospheric pressure less than that generated by the recoil of the aspirator exists on the inspiratory side of the conduit of the circuit. The circuit provides that after the check valve opens, alveolar gas is rebreathed in preference to dead space gas because the interconnecting conduit is located such that exhaled alveolar gas contained in the tube conducting the expired gas into the expiratory reservoir bag will be closest to it and dead space gas will be mixed with other exhaled gases in the reservoir bag. The exhaled gas reservoir is preferably sized at about 3 L which is well excess of the volume of an individual&apos;s breath. When the patient inhales gas from the reservoir bag, the reservoir bag collapses to displace the volume of gas extracted from the bag, minimizing the volume of atmospheric air entering the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The basic approach of preventing a decrease in PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>with increase ventilation is briefly described as follows. Only breathing the fresh gas contributes to alveolar ventilation (VA) which establishes the gradient for CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>elimination. All gas breathed in excess of the fresh gas entering the circuit, or the fresh gas flow, is rebreathed gas. The closer the partial pressure of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in the inhaled gas to that of mixed venous blood (PvCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), the less the effect on CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>elimination. The relationship between the alveolar ventilation, minute ventilation (V) and PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of rebreathed gas is VA&equals;FGF&plus;(V&minus;FGF)(PvCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of exhaled gas)/PvCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>where FGF stands for the fresh gas flow. With respect to this circuit, the fresh gas flow is equivalent to the rate of atmospheric air aspirated into the atmospheric air aspirator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is clear from this equation that as the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of the exhaled gas approaches that of the mixed venous blood, the alveolar ventilation is determined only by the fresh gas flow and not the minute ventilation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As one exhales, the first gas to exit the mouth comes from the tracheas where no gas exchange has occurred. The PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of this gas is identical to that of the inhaled gas and is termed as &ldquo;dead space gas&rdquo;. The last gas to exit the mouth originates from the alveoli and has had the most time to equilibrate with mixed venous blood, has a PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>closest to that of mixed venous blood and is termed as &ldquo;alveolar gas&rdquo;. Gas exhaled between these two periods has a PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>intermediate between the two concentrations. The equation cited above explains why rebreathing alveolar gas would be the most effective in maintaining the PCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at a constant level when minute ventilation increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the above isocapnia circuit: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> 1. All of the fresh gas, in the form of atmospheric air, is inhaled by the subject and contributes to alveolar ventilation when minute ventilation is equal to or exceeds the rate of atmospheric air aspirated into the AAA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> 2. The alveolar gas is preferentially rebreathed when minute ventilation exceeds the fresh gas flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of the invention will appear to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples to be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims. </paragraph>
