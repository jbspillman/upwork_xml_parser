<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to block mask making methods, block masks and exposure apparatuses. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of making a block mask used for pattern batch exposure, such a block mask, and an exposure apparatus using the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An exposure process for forming desired patterns on a wafer such as a semiconductor substrate is performed in the process of fabricating semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Electron beam exposure for drawing patterns with an electron beam is known as an exposure method as described above. However, the electron beam exposure is so-called a single-stroke method in which patterns are painted out by a beam with its cross section shaped into a rectangle. Therefore, the electron beam exposure has a disadvantage in that the finer the pattern, the lower the throughput in wafer production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of eliminating the above disadvantage, a throughput-improved method has been developed in which a block mask having pattern-shaped openings are arranged in the position of the second aperture of an electron beam exposure apparatus, these patterns being drawn in batch fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a diagram of steps of a conventional exposure procedure using the block mask. As is shown in this figure, IC data <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for designing an IC is processed in step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of producing exposure data. This step results in wafer exposure data <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and block mask making data <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The block mask making data <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used to make a block mask <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The wafer exposure data <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> describes an exposure procedure with the block mask <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Next, the block mask <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is produced based on the block mask making data <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the block mask <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, approximately 100 blocks are formed each having a size of 5 &mgr;m&times;5 &mgr;m. Each block is subjected to exposure and is transferred on a wafer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in batch fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In an exposure step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> following step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an electron beam from a beam source of the exposure apparatus is projected onto a given block of the block mask <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> designated by the wafer exposure data <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The beam passes through the given block and forms an image on a target area on the wafer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above exposure process is repeated, so that patterns corresponding to a designed integrated circuit can be transferred on the wafer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a view of an outline of the conventional exposure apparatus. As is shown in this figure, the exposure apparatus is made up of an electronic gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a first aperture <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a deflector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the block mask <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and another deflector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The electron beam emitted from the electronic gun <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shaped by the first aperture <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and is adjusted by the deflector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to be irradiated onto a given block of the block mask <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The electron beam passing through the block mask <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is adjusted so as to form an image of the pattern on a given area on the wafer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, so that the pattern can be transferred thereon. The above process is repeated until all patterns are transferred on the wafer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The wafer exposure data <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is used to control the deflectors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a stage on which the wafer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is placed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As described above, the exposure method with the block mask makes it possible to transfer each pattern of the block mask on the wafer in batch fashion. Thus, the block mask exposure method has a higher throughput than that of the so-called single stroke exposure method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> By the way, generally, IC data is formed by a plurality of layers (for example, a wiring layer, a gate layer, and a hole layer). Conventionally, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22, a</cross-reference> block mask is made for each layer, and exposure is performed on the layer basis. Similarly, a block mask is formed for each layer of each piece of IC data formed by identical or different basic figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> An example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows a case where IC data consist of IC data <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for a wiring layer, IC data <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for a gate layer, and IC data <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for a hole layer. Blocks extracted from the respective IC data are arranged on the block mask, so that the respective mask block for each layer can be formed. For example, blocks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are extracted from the IC data <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a block mask <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> including these blocks is made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In exposure using the respective block mask for each layer, the block mask of the layer to be drawn is loaded to the exposure apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> However, the above method needs the respective block mask for each layer, and is therefore expensive. Further, the method takes a long time to make the masks. Furthermore, the block mask is exchanged on the layer basis. This reduces throughput. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Taking into the above into consideration, an object of the present invention is to provide a block mask making method, a block mask and an exposure apparatus capable of reducing the cost without reducing throughput of the exposure apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The above object of the present invention is achieved by a method of making a block mask used for pattern batch exposure, comprising: an extraction step of extracting blocks from basic figures that belong to one or more layers of a semiconductor device and form an integrated circuit; and an arrangement determining step of determining an arrangement of the blocks extracted by the extraction step on a block mask. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The above object of the present invention is also achieved by an exposure apparatus drawing a circuit pattern on a semiconductor substrate by exposure made by steps of: extracting blocks from basic figures forming an integrated circuit that belongs to one or more layers of a semiconductor device; and determining an arrangement of the extracted blocks on the block mask. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a view of an embodiment of the block mask making method of the invention. First, blocks are extracted from IC data <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the layer basis by steps S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, blocks for a wiring layer are extracted in step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and blocks for a gate layer are extracted in step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, blocks for a hole layer being extracted in step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, blocks to be formed in a mask are selected from among all the blocks extracted by steps S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. More particularly, as will be described layer, priority for selection is given to blocks having a comparatively large number of reduced shots (which is equal to the result of subtracting the number of times block exposure is performed from the number of times variable rectangular beam exposure is performed) for an identical pattern. In selection, if there are overlapping blocks, these blocks are unified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the positions of the blocks picked up in step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the mask block are determined in accordance with a predetermined rule. For example, the predetermined rule is such that the smaller the size of the minimum figure included in the block, the closer to the center of the mask the figure is arranged, as will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The data produced in step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is stored as block mask making data <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the outline of the above process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As is shown in this figure, blocks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are extracted from the IC data <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the wiring layer. Blocks <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are extracted from the IC data <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the gate layer.

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Among the blocks extracted, blocks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are the same and are thus unified. Similarly, blocks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are the same and are thus unified. Finally, only the blocks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the number of blocks that can be arranged on a block mask <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is greater than the number of blocks extracted. Therefore, all the extracted blocks may be arranged on the block mask <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, blocks are selected or discarded in accordance with a rule, which will be described later. The blocks thus selected are arranged on the block mask in a rule which will be described later, so that exposure precision and throughput can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The block data is processed by a computer as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A computer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in this figure includes a CPU (Central Processing Unit) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a ROM (Read Only Memory) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a RAM (Random Access Memory) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, a GB (Graphics Board) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, an I/F (Interface) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, a bus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, a display unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>, and an input unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>executes various operations in accordance with programs stored in the HDD <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, and controls the parts of the apparatus. The ROM <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>stores primary programs executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The RAM <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>temporarily stores data and program being processed by the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The HDD <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>stores programs executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and IC data. The GB <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>executes a drawing process in response to drawing instructions issued by the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and converts image data thus obtained into a video signal, which is supplied to the display unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flowchart of the details of step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The flowchart selects blocks to be formed in the block mask. After the flowchart starts, the following steps are executed sequentially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>inputs the block data extracted by steps S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>computes the number of reduced shots by using block exposure. The number of shots to be reduced may be obtained by subtracting the number of reduced shots in block exposure from that of shots in variable rectangular beam exposure. As the number of reduced shots increases, block exposure can be performed by the smaller number of shots than that in variable rectangular beam exposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For instance, a block consisting of three rectangles can be exposed by performing the drawing step three times by the variable rectangular beam exposure. In contrast, the same block can be exposed by performing the drawing only at one time by batch exposure. Thus, the number of reduced shots is &ldquo;2&rdquo; (&equals;3&minus;1) for the above case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>searches for the same block in order to avoid double registration of block, and updates a block table that will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a view of an example of identical blocks with an identical pattern to be drawn. In the example illustrated, block numbers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> have the same pattern. It is possible to determine whether patterns are the same as each other by comparing the coordinates of the apexes of rectangular patterns included in the blocks with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a block table. As is illustrated, the block table is made up of a block number, name of product type, name of layer, the number of reduced shots, the number of times of batch exposure, the number of patterns, the number of apexes, and data of the coordinates of apexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The block number is a serial number assigned to each block. The name of product type indicates the type of IC such as DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). The name of layer is the name of layer to which the block belongs, such as a wiring layer, gate layer or hole layer. The number of reduced shots is obtained by subtracting the number of times of block exposure from the number of times of variable rectangular beam exposure. The number of times of batch exposure is performed is the number of exposure times by batch exposure. The number of patterns indicates the number of patterns included in the block. The number of apexes indicates the number of apexes of the pattern. The coordinates of apexes indicate the coordinates of all apexes included in one pattern. The coordinates of a single apex may be described as (X<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1, Y<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1). A single block is formed by a plurality of patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, blocks having the same patterns are searched for by comparing the coordinates of apexes in the respective block tables. If such blocks are identified, the respectively block numbers are unified for avoidance of double registration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows block tables of the blocks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, block numbers <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are unified in block number <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Next, the reduced number of shots is made to assume the sum of the numbers of items of block data in all the blocks. This is because the number of shots can be very much reduced for the overlapping blocks. The above makes it possible for the overlapping blocks to be selected preferentially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>determines the order of forming so that it starts from the block with the largest number of shots that can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>determines whether the number of blocks to be formed (the number of blocks that have been chosen for forming) is equal to the number of all blocks extracted by steps S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If the answer is affirmative, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>recognizes that all the blocks have been processed and ends the process. Otherwise, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>determines whether the number of blocks to be formed is equal to the number N of blocks that can be formed in the block mask (for example, N&equals;100). If the answer is affirmative, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>recognizes that all the blocks have been processed and ends the process. Otherwise, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>returns to step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the same process is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the above-mentioned manner, the blocks can be selected so that the number of reduced shots in exposure can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned embodiment of the present invention employs a single processor, namely only the single CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Alternatively, a multiprocessor system can be employed in which a plurality of CPUs do respective jobs in parallel. The multiprocessor system may improve the processing speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, if the computer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> includes CPUs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the block extraction for the items <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of IC data and the processes of steps S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be distributed to the CPUs <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. For example, the CPU <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>handles step S<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the CPU <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>handles step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, while the CPU <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>handles step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This may reduce the time necessary for producing the block mask making data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, of a process for arranging the selected blocks on the block mask. This figure shows the details of step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. After the flowchart starts, the following steps are performed sequentially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>inputs the block data of selected blocks obtained by the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. It is now assumed that the block data has patterns of basic figures described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a relationship among the basic figures, the name of product type and the name of layer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> depicts examples of the basic figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In producing IC data, the types of basic figures used depend on the chip functions. For example, a group of items of IC data for the name of product type &ldquo;A&rdquo; is produced based on basic figures &num;1-&num;9. IC data <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> and IC data <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> for the name of product type &ldquo;A&rdquo; are both related to a wiring layer, but have different numbers of basic figures that should be arranged in different positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;name of layer&rdquo; indicates the name of IC data exposed in each step during the wafer production. A group of items of IC data for each product type includes data on the wiring layer, hole layer, gate layer and element isolation layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, basic figures &num;1-&num;4 relate to the wiring layers, and basic figures &num;5-&num;8 relate to the hole layers, basic layers &num;9-&num;12 relating to the gate layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>creates a block group table, in which a group of blocks extracted from IC data of the same product type and the same layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an example of the block group table. As is shown, the block group table is formed by a block group number, the number of times block group batch exposure is performed, the smallest edge size of block group pattern, the number of block types, and block number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Here, the block group number is an identification number assigned to each block group. The number of times block group batch exposure is performed indicates the number of exposure times necessary for batch exposure of the block group. The smallest edge size of block group pattern indicates the smallest edge size out of the edges of all patterns included in all blocks of the block group. The number of block types indicates the type of blocks that belong to the block group. The block number is an identification number designating the blocks that belong to the block group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In order that the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>creates the block group table, first, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>refers to the name of product type and the name of layer stored in the block table shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, and acquires data that belongs to the same layer of the same product type. The data thus acquired is stored in the block group table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, blocks extracted from IC data <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> and IC data <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> belong to the same block group. Similarly, blocks extracted from IC data <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> and IC data <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> belong to the same block group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>computes the number of times block group batch exposure is performed, and stores it in the block group table. The number of times block group batch exposure is performed is the total of batch exposure times of all blocks that belong to the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>recognizes the smallest edge size of the block group pattern, which is the shortest edge size among the sizes of the edges of all the patterns extracted from all the blocks of the block group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>executes a process for determining the position of the block arranged on the block mask. There are two arrangement methods described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> 1. First Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> (1) First, the priority is assigned to the block groups in the decreasing order of the number of times of batch exposure. The priority order starts from 1, and increases one by one. The priority assigned to the block group having the largest number of times of batch exposure is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and the priority assigned to the block group having the second largest number of times of batch exposure is &ldquo;2&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> (2) Next, the arrangement position on the mask is determined for each block group. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the mask is divided into 25 areas. The block group to which the highest priority &ldquo;1&rdquo; is assigned is arranged in area &num;1, and the block groups to which priorities 2-9 are respectively assigned are arranged in areas &num;2. Similarly, the block groups to which priorities 10-25 are respectively assigned are arranged in areas &num;3. The details of area &num;1 in which block groups have been arranged are illustrated in the lower part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> 2. Second Method </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> (1) First, the priority is given to the block groups in the increasing order of the smallest edge size of the block group patterns. The priority order starts from &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and increases one by one. The priority assigned to the block group having the smallest edge size is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and the priority assigned to the block group having the second smallest edge size is &ldquo;2&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> (2) Next, the arrangement position on the mask is determined for each block group. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the mask is divided into 25 areas. The block group to which the highest priority &ldquo;1&rdquo; is assigned is arranged in area &num;1, and the block groups to which priorities 2-9 are respectively assigned are arranged in areas &num;2. Similarly, the block groups to which priorities 10-25 are respectively assigned are arranged in areas &num;3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the CPU <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>outputs to the HDD <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, for example, the block mask making data, the positions of which have been determined, the block mask making data being stored in a given storage area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A block having a relatively large number of times of drawing is arranged close to the center when the first method is employed. This contributes to reducing the distance of movement of the electron beam and speeding up the exposure process. When the second method is employed, a block having a relatively small size of pattern is arranged close to the center in which the electron beam is moved slightly with relatively high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> If there are many blocks, all the blocks will not be able to be arranged on the block mask. In this case, batch exposure is performed and variable rectangular beam exposure is performed with respect to parts that have not been exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Since blocks that need a relatively large number of reduced shots are preferentially arranged on the mask, throughput may be improved even when variable rectangular beam exposure follows, as compared to the case where only variable rectangular beam exposure is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A description will be given, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, of second and third embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the present invention arranges blocks included in all layers of the same IC are properly selected and are arranged on the single block mask taking into account the positions of arrangement. In contrast, the second embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, performs processing similar to that of the first embodiment with respect to a block included in IC data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of different semiconductor devices formed by the same basic figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In an example illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, an exposure data producing process of step S<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is performed with respect to items <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of IC data of different semiconductor devices formed by the same basic figures. This results in items <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of wafer exposure data for the respective ICs, and block mask making data <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Then, a block mask <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> common to all ICs is produced from the block mask making data <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In subsequent step S<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, wafer exposure data is selected based on the type of ICs to be fabricated. In this case, the common block mask <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be used independent of the type of ICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Next, a description will be given, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, of an example of the block mask making process according to the second embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In an example of this figure, blocks are extracted from items <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>of IC data respectively corresponding to n semiconductor devices by steps S<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-S<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>n. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, blocks that are to be formed in the mask are selected from among the blocks extracted in the above-mentioned manner.

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the present invention, there is provided a method of making a block mask used for pattern batch exposure, comprising: an extraction step of extracting blocks from basic figures that belong to one or more layers of a semiconductor device and form an integrated circuit; and an arrangement determining step of determining an arrangement of the blocks extracted by the extraction step on a block mask. Thus, as compared to layer-based block mask making, the cost and time can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Also, in the block mask used for pattern batch exposure, blocks extracted from basic figures that belong to one or more layers of the semiconductor device. This avoids troublesome replacement of block mask and improves throughput in fabrication of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Further, in an exposure apparatus drawing a circuit pattern on a semiconductor substrate by exposure, such exposure is performed using a block mask made by steps of: extracting blocks from basic figures forming an integrated circuit that belongs to one or more layers of a semiconductor device; and determining an arrangement of the blocks extracted on the block mask. Thus, this avoids troublesome replacement of block mask and improves throughput in fabrication of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
