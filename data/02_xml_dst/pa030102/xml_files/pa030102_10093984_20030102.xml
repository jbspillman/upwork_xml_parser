<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to bulk boxes for receiving and storing goods and, more particularly, to an improved system and method of erecting bulk boxes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In many applications, it is often desirable to achieve economies by receiving and storing large amounts of products in stackable boxes. As well, maximizing the size of the boxes helps to keep costs down in that fewer boxes are required. Less effort is also required to move loads stored in the larger boxes in that more product is moved per trip, as with a forklift truck, than with more numerous, smaller boxes. However, as the size of the boxes, and substantially the size of the sidewalls increase, the stackability suffers in that the larger sidewalls are more prone to collapse under vertical loading. This is especially the case in those boxes having dimensions of several feet that are used to store and transport loads often weighing thousands of pounds, i.e., resin beads, powders, bulk produce, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To help maintain stackability while using larger boxes, it is desirable to use boxes having an octagonal shape. Rather than having four side walls that intersect in four ninety degree corners, octagonal boxes, as the name suggests, are eight sided. Rather than having the four ninety degree corners as in a standard box, each corner has been replaced with yet another sidewall that in essence, &ldquo;cuts the corner.&rdquo; This structure provides much greater vertical stability to allow greater loads to be supported by each box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, octagonal boxes are not without their own problems. Quite often, octagonal boxes are used in concert with pallets to facilitate stacking, movement, and increase the load each box may hold. However, in that these boxes are rather large and tend to be constructed of heavy materials, the boxes experience &ldquo;memory.&rdquo; This means that the materials tend to resist maintaining the proper form. The resulting biased attitude of the box may result in the box being structurally impaired because it is &ldquo;off the platform,&rdquo; meaning portions of the box may no longer be supported by the pallet. Also, the heft of the materials and size of the boxes require excessive manipulation on the part of the person erecting the box to get it in the proper form and maintain that form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Prior art attempts to solve these problems have included the use of such items as &ldquo;squaring jigs.&rdquo; Although the jigs do help reduce the potential for biased attitude and potential failure of the octagonal boxes, their use adds to both the cost of assembling the boxes as well as the overall number of steps required to complete assembly. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The problem of maintaining a box in the proper attitude described above is overcome without squaring jigs and the additional steps required for their use. In accordance with the present invention, a sequence of flap folds along with a &ldquo;notching&rdquo; of the flaps is utilized to aid in setting up the box and maintaining the box in the proper attitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention includes a box formed from a unitary blank of material. The unitary blank has a plurality of sidewalls, each of the plurality of sidewalls is foldably connected to an adjacent sidewall. The unitary blank also includes a plurality of flaps that has a main flap, a pair of side flaps, and a closure flap, each of the flaps having an attached edge, a pair of side edges, and a free edge. Each of the flaps is foldably connected to a separate one of the sidewalls. The unitary blank further has a plurality of alignment notches, each of the alignment notches is arranged and configured to engage an adjacent side edge of an adjacent one of the flaps. Each of the side edges of the main flap also includes an alignment notch, and the main flap, the pair of side flaps, and the closure flap form a bottom of the box when folded perpendicular to the plurality of sidewalls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention includes a method of forming a box. The method includes the steps of folding a unitary blank such that a plurality of sidewalls is formed, one of the sidewalls including a first and second portion that are joined by a securing means. Next, a pair of side flaps is engaged with a pair of alignment notches disposed on a main flap by folding the main flap inwardly until the main flap is perpendicular to the plurality of sidewalls. The pair of side flaps is then folded inwardly until each of the side flaps is perpendicular to the plurality of sidewalls. A closure flap is folded inwardly until the closure flap is perpendicular to said plurality of sidewalls, and then secured in position perpendicular to the plurality of sidewalls, thereby forming a bottom of the box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the present invention will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, prior to assembly of the octagonal box, a unitary blank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is produced having the desired dimensions. In the preferred embodiment shown, alignment notches <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, are formed on portions of the flaps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to aid in both alignment of the side walls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> during assembly, and to maintain proper attitude of the octagonal box upon completion as well. Each flap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is foldably connected to the unitary blank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along an attached edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and further includes a pair of side edges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a free edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Also, the main flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and pair of side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also include corner tabs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which assist in stabilizing the box after construction by both increasing the surface area of the bottom and allowing the box to be secured to a pallet. Fold lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> separate the sidewalls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from each other as well as the flaps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the unitary blank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The fold lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> assist in assembly of the box. A closure flap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also provided. Assembly of the octagonal box of the preferred embodiment will now be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> portion of the octagonal box has been formed by keeping one sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> stationary and folding the unitary blank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along fold lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> separating the individual sidewalls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The two outermost sidewalls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>overlap and are joined by any adequate securing means, such as glue, tape, staples, etc., to form a single sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. All that remains is the formation of the bottom of the octagonal box to complete assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The main flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is folded along its associated fold line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> until it is perpendicular to the sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> portion (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The alignment notches <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> located on the side edges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the main flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extend slightly beyond sidewalls <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>and above the adjacent side edges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the pair of side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This arrangement ensures the alignment notches <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will engage the side edges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, meaning the main flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will remain in proper position as the rest of the bottom is assembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are folded along their respective fold lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> until perpendicular to the sidewall <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> portion. The side edges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that are adjacent to the closure flap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> include alignment notches <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. By folding the side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> inward, the alignment notches <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are brought into abutment with the side edges <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the closure flap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment shown, folding the main flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in this manner causes a recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be formed by the free edges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the flaps. Recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is configured to receive securing tab <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> disposed on the free edge <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the closure flap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To complete assembly of the octagonal box, the closure flap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is folded along its respective fold line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and securing tab <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is pushed through recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> , as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As described, the bottom is self-locking and complete. The bottom can also be modified so that it is not self-locking, and the same configuration of alignment notches <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and flaps <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, could be used to facilitate assembly and maintain the attitude of the box after construction. The primary difference being, rather than the tab <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> means of securing the bottom, glue, tape, staples, or a similar securing means would be required. As such, the free edges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the flaps need not be configured so as to form the recess <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or securing tab <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. For added stability, corner tabs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, may be secured to a pallet by clamping, nailing, stapling, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that similar notching and flap systems can be used in boxes having varying numbers of sides, i.e., hexagonal boxes. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that embodiments of the present invention are envisioned that have dimensions ranging from a few inches up to several feet, depending on the use of the box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present invention, particularly, any &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; embodiments, are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the invention. Many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments of the invention without departing substantially from the spirit and principles of the invention. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and the present invention and protected by the following claims. </paragraph>
