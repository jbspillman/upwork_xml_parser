<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to ubiquitous computing systems and, more particularly, to determining information related to broadcast content. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Broadcast radio and television mediums have proliferated extensively throughout the world, providing a mass market economical content distribution format. However, one short-coming of broadcast media is its lack of interactivity. With the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, many individuals are able to experience content in a narrow-cast format, with inherent interactivity. One advantage of a system with interactivity is the ability to complete a feedback loop that can drive commercial transactions based on a user&apos;s interest in the content. Yet much of the most interesting and valuable content is still provided in the broadcast format. The opportunity to interact, or at least to &ldquo;bookmark&rdquo; or remember content that is provided in broadcast format is therefore valuable. Products have been introduced that allow a user to &ldquo;bookmark&rdquo; or remember a broadcast content program that was experienced. Xenote of San Mateo, California produces a product called iTag. This product is in the form of a key fob, and provides the function of recording a time and date when a button on the iTag is activated by the user. The iTag includes a serial port for connecting it to a Personal Computer for the purpose of downloading the time and date information to the Internet. The iTag is used as follows: A user listens to their favorite radio station, for example in their automobile. When an interesting content item, for example a song, is featured, the user activates the button on the iTag. The iTag device includes an internal microprocessor with a time and date memory function. When the button is activated, the current time and date is written into a memory slot. At some later date, the user connects the iTag to their PC and downloads the time and date listings to a website where each time and date pair is cross-referenced to a lookup table containing the content being played at that time and date on a specific radio station. The iTag requires that the user remember the particular radio station that they were listening to at the time that the button on the iTag was activated, for a specific item of content. Since the iTag can store up to 50 time and date stamps, this presents a challenge for a user who listens to two or more radio stations on a regular basis. In fact, most car stereo head units provide several preset radio station buttons, and many users change radio stations several times per day to avoid advertisements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the user must remember to connect the iTag to their PC. They must then select the radio station corresponding to a particular time and date stamp on a web site. There is excessive burden placed on the user to remember radio station to which they were listening when the &ldquo;bookmark&rdquo; was activated, and additionally, by having to remember to manually dock the iTag device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Description of Preferred Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> First the components and sub-systems included in the system and method for determining information related to broadcast source signals (also referred to as the disclosed system or frequency-matching system) will be described. Then the operation of the disclosed system will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;radio tuner&rdquo; is used to refer to any device that detects, tunes to, and amplifies terrestrially broadcast electromagnetic radio waves for the purpose of producing an audio output signal. Common examples include home stereo systems, car stereo players, and portable radios among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Web, world wide web, and Internet are used here interchangeably, and are defined as connected computers, the connection being via standardized digital communications protocols, such as TCP-IP and HTTP and the like, including wirelessly linked devices that may use other protocols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Broadband connection is defined as a connection to the Internet that provides upstream (sending messages to the Internet) data-rates of approximately 400K or more bits per second, and downstream speeds of approximately 100K or more bits per second. There are many different types of broadband connections including DSL, cable modems, and fixed and mobile wireless connections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The term gateway, used interchangeably with broadband gateway, is defined as an integral modem and router, and may include hub functionality. The modem function is used to change voltage fluctuations on an input carrier line (a DSL line input or a cable TV input) into digital data. Routers are devices that connect one distinct network to another by passing only certain IP addresses that are targeted for specific networks. Hubs allow one network signal input to be split and thus services many devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;message&rdquo; is defined as information that is sent digitally from one computing device to another for the purpose of controlling the functions of devices, and for determining device status. The term &ldquo;content&rdquo; is used to mean the information contained in digital files or streams, or analog broadcasts, that is related to end-users. For example, content is entertainment or news, that is, information that was for the most part created by entities other than the end-user. &ldquo;Data&rdquo; is used to mean information created by end-users such as digital schedule contents, responses from devices sent back through the system, or digital messages and email. &ldquo;Content&rdquo; and &ldquo;data&rdquo; are sometimes used interchangeably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Local Area Network (LAN) is defined as a network structure that includes two or more devices that can communicate with other devices on a shared communication system including wired network technologies, such as Ethernet, or wireless network technologies such as those based on the IEEE 802.11b specification. Wireless LAN technology such as 802.11b are based on the unlicensed 2.4 Ghz frequency band and are well known in the telecommunications and LAN industries. These networking technologies utilize TCP/IP protocols. A LAN typically constitutes a group of interconnected devices that share a physical vicinity. A LAN for example would be a home network where several computers and other smart devices, such as an Internet connected frequency-matching device (described below) would be digitally connected for the purpose of transferring content and data, controlling each other, sharing programming, or presenting data and content to an end user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> HTTP is Hyper-text transfer protocol, the protocol used by Web browsers and Web servers to transfer files, such as text and graphic files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Description of the Frequency-Matching Device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The disclosed system, shown at the system-level in block diagram form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, includes a frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, shown in block diagram form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is comprised of an embedded computer system, including a microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a non-volatile flash memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for retaining programming (called firmware), a system memory (DRAM) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for dynamically executing programming and storing data, and related components associated with embedded computer systems such as discrete logic components, passive electronic components, and the like. Frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also includes an internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> functionally connected to microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via an industry standard control bus, that allows for two-way communication between microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the control bus is the I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>C control bus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The specification as well as components for I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>C control bus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are available from Philips N.V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Using control bus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can control the frequency to which the internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is tuned. The frequency that internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is tuned to is available as digital data to microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and can be stored in memory <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also outputs the analog audio component of the tuned broadcast signal, which is the internal tuned audio signal. Internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be conventional AM/ FM radio tuner on a chip system that detects and amplifies broadcast electromagnetic waves at specific frequencies. Internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a phase-locked loop (PLL) system, which is a function that allows it to determine when it is tuned to a terrestrial broadcast signal that is of significant strength, and lock on to that signal. An example of such a chip is the TDA7421 AM/FM Tuner for Car Radio and Hi-Fi Applications, manufactured by ST Microelectronics of Saint Genis-Pouilly, France. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Frequcncy-Matching Device LAN Connection to Gateway and Internet </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also includes a connection to the Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, this connection is comprised of an 802.11b wireless LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connection that connects to a gateway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with an integral 802.11b network interface adapter. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of the topography of the system. It should be noted that frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is capable of sending XML messages using TCP/IP protocols, to servers on Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, via wireless LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connection and gateway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Firmware instructions in frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> control this function. The information that frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> needs to send messages to the server on Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, such as IP addresses and port numbers, is sent to frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> from Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> when frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is initially booted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Frequency-Matching Device Clock Sub-System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, frequency-matching device 4 also includes a clock sub-system <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that provides the current time and date to microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, to be stored in memory <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Clock sub-system <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> functions by receiving an initial time and date input from an external source, such as a time reference web server on Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, via gateway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with wireless LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connection, and thereafter accurately increments the time and date with its own internal timing circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Tag Button and Function </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that is an interface control element for the end-user. Tag button <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is an electrical switch that is connected to a port on microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As part of its function, microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> continually monitors that port for a change in voltage that occurs if tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is activated by the end-user. For example, in a non-activated state, there is a logic low voltage level at tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> port. When the user activates tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> becomes aware of a logic high voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> External Tuner Signal Input Into Frequency-Matching Device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The output of the external radio tuner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the external tuned audio signal, is connected to the input of frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> signal-preprocessing circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by an external radio tuner signal tap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. External radio tuner signal tap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a cable that connects at one end to a tuner system signal output port, such as the left and right tape monitor out jacks that are included on most stereo receivers. At this end external radio tuner signal tap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has connectors that connect to the RCA-type jacks, but allow the external tuned audio signal to pass through so that the connectors can still be used by other devices. The other end of external radio tuner signal tap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> cable is connected to a jack included in frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that connect external tuned audio signal through to signal-preprocessing circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (described below). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an alternative method for accessing the external tuned audio signal that utilizes a sub-system that is a microphone <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> connected to a pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the output of which in turn is connected to the external tuned audio signal input on signal-preprocessing circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Microphone transducer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is located on the outer surface of frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> enclosure, so that it is in the presence of ambient sound. The ambient sound that is potentially an amplified broadcast radio signal, picked up by microphone <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, is the signal that is input into the external tuned audio signal input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Signal Pre-Processing Circuit </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Signal-preprocessing circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is part of frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> detail of signal-preprocessing circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the internal tuned audio signal from internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the external tuned audio signal from external radio tuner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are each connected to a separate AC (alternating current) coupling and signal centering circuit. The AC coupling circuit <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> insures that both the internal tuned audio signal and the external tuned audio signal are centered on the same reference voltage with no DC component to the signal. That is, if the external tune audio signal and the external tuned audio signal are the same, both signals will cross the reference voltage at the same time, regardless of gain (signal amplitude) differences. The values of each resistor (R) shown in the schematic are the same. The pre-processed internal tuned audio signal and the pre-processed external tuned audio signal are then connected to the signal inputs of the two non-inverting comparators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Non-inverting comparators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> share the reference voltage, also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Non-inverting comparators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, such as part number LMC6762, manufactured by National Semiconductor of Sunnyvale, Calif., are electronic devices that compare a signal voltage with a reference voltage. If the signal voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the output of the non-inverting comparator will be a logic low voltage (0 volts). If the signal voltage is greater than the reference voltage, then the output of the non-inverting comparator voltage will be a logic high (5 volts is commonly used). Comparators and their arrangement with the other components shown here are well known in the electronic device industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The output of non-inverting comparators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are each connected to an input to a logical exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device. An example of an exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device is part number MC14077, manufactured by On Semiconductor of Phoenix, Ariz. The exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device functions such that if the two inputs into the exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device are the same voltage (logic) level (within some small tolerance), the output of the exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device is a logical high. If the voltage (logic) levels of the inputs into the exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device are different (within some small tolerance), the output of the exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device will be a logic low signal. Therefore, this circuit functions such that if the external tuned audio signal and the internal tuned audio signal are the same, then they have the same frequency (within some minute phase shift tolerance) and the outputs of comparators <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> will be the same because the internal tuned audio signal and the external tuned audio signal will be above or below the reference voltage at the same time. In this case, the exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device will substantially and continually register a logic high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If the external tuned audio signal and the internal tuned audio signal are different, (i.e., the two radio tuners are tuned to different broadcast radio stations), then they have different frequencies and the outputs of the two comparators will mostly differ over time. When they are different, the exclusive NOR gate <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> device will register a logic low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Signal Match Duty-Cycle Monitor </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The output of signal-preprocessing circuit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is connected to a port on microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> called the signal match port. Firmware instructions cause the microprocessor to regularly read the value of the logic level at the signal match port, in coordination with the control of internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sample rate at the signal match port is very high, for example, sampling once every milli-second, or 1000 times per second. The percentage of the time that the signal is high is the signal match duty-cycle. A large value, such as 75% (the signal is high 75% of the time), for the signal match duty-cycle, indicates that the external tuned audio signal is the same frequency as the internal tuned audio signal. Likewise, a low value such as 20% for the signal match duty-cycle indicates that the internal tuned audio signal and the external tuned audio signal differ in frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Operation of Frequency-Matching System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Next the operation of frequency matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and system is described including a frequency-matching function and a tag-processing function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> One function of frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is to derive the frequency that external radio tuner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is currently tuned to. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the flow of operations. After booting, according to firmware instructions, microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> instructs internal AM/FM tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to tune to frequency <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Frequency <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a special location in memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that holds a value for a radio broadcast frequency. In one case, for the definition of frequency <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the first time that frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is powered on (or if frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has never discovered a frequency-match), frequency <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the lowest frequency broadcast signal that internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can lock onto. For example, in the U.S., FM commercial broadcast radio signals range between 88.0 and 108.0 Mhz. AM commercial broadcast radio signals range between 540 and 1600 Khz. In the initial state, microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> instructs internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to tune to the lowest frequency on the FM band, for example 80 Mhz. If internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> determines that there is no significant signal strength at this frequency, firmware instructs internal radio tuner to tune incrementally up the band until it receives a signal of significant strength. This typically means that there is a local radio station broadcasting at this frequency. Internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> signals microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that it has locked onto a broadcasting radio station. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> then samples the signal-match duty cycle port. The process for determining if there is a match is described above. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, if there is a match, the frequency value is written into the flash memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The time and date are also immediately recorded into memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at this point, for the purpose of defining preferred stations, a function disclosed below. In this state where a match has been found, firmware instructions cause microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to re-sample the signal match duty cycle port every half-second until a match is no longer found. If a match is not found, frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> instructs internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to tune to another broadcast signal, either from a preferred list (described below), or the next higher frequency broadcast radio signal that internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can lock onto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> must sample the signal match duty cycle for only a fraction of a second to determine if a match exists. Therefore, the process of scanning and analyzing radio signals in order to derive the frequency of the external tuned audio signal may take a few seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Frequencies and Scan Sequence </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also stores the frequency of the last matched frequency, and when the device is powered on, this frequency is set as frequency <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The system records in memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> the most tuned-to frequencies (radio stations), in order of length of time that the user has listened to those frequencies. For example, the system stores the top ten preferred stations. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> stores in memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a record of the time when a specific signal match occurred, and the time when the signal match ended, using internal clock <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> function to time-stamp these events. Frequency-match frequencies are then stored in memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order of the length of time that the frequency-match was sustained. For example, the frequency-match with the longest sustained match time is stored as the first frequency to be scanned (after frequency <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). As frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is used over time, the list of preferred radio stations increases. When the frequency-matching device is powered on, if there is no match at frequency <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, then microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> instructs internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to sequentially tune to frequencies in the preferred frequency list one by one until a match is found. If no match is found, microprocessor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> instructs internal radio tuner <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to start at the lowest tunable frequency and sequentially tune to higher frequencies until a match is found. This process is described above in detail. Frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> will scan through the FM broadcast spectrum and if no match is found it will then scan through the AM broadcast spectrum. Frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> continues to search for a frequency-match until a frequency-match is found, or until the device is powered off. By tuning to frequencies in a preferred list of frequencies created from practice, the time it takes for frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to find the frequency-match value is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> User-Level Function&mdash;Tag Processing Function </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the frequency-matching device with tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on the front bezel. Tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is used for identifying or tagging audio content being played on external radio tuner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> device. When tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is activated by a user, assuming that a frequency match has occurred within the system as described above, an XML message, the tag message, is created and sent to a tag-processing server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, via LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and gateway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The XML tag message includes the current frequency-match frequency value, the time and date from the clock, and a unique serial number for frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The information in the tag message is then used by a tag processing software application running on tag-processing server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located on Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, to derive the content that was being played on external radio tuner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the tag button was activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In order to access responses to tagged content, the user has established an account on tag processing server <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and has provided information including the user&apos;s zip code. The user account sub-system is a functional aspect of tag processing software application. The user-also provides the unique serial number for frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at the web account. Since frequency matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is located on user&apos;s LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the operation of providing the tag processing software application with a unique serial number for frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> could be automated. When a tag-message is received at tag-processing server, tag processing software application at the server matches frequency-matching device&apos;s unique serial number with the user&apos;s account information, and can therefore establish the geographic location by use of the user&apos;s zip code. The tag-processing server software application has access to a zip code-radio frequency database that includes all of the zip codes in the U.S. cross-referenced with radio stations and their broadcast frequencies whose broadcasts reach the zip code areas. Tag processing software application compares the frequency-match value included in the tag message with the radio station broadcast frequencies associated with the user&apos;s zip code area until a match is found. When the tagged broadcast radio station has been identified using the above process, a broadcast content playlist is obtained for the specific broadcast radio station. This playlist is a listing of content that was broadcast on a specific date and time. Broadcast content playlists are available from at least two firms, BDS, Inc. (Broadcast Data Systems) of Kansas City, Mo., and MediaBase, Inc. of Sherman Oaks, Calif. Using a patented computer technology, BDS monitors radio and television broadcasts, identifying songs and commercials as they are being aired, and provides playlist data for a fee. Mediabase currently monitors more than 800 radio stations in 125 markets, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Additionally, firms can track daily airplay activity on a subscription basis via Mediabase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The date and time included in the tag-message is cross-referenced with the date and time in the broadcast content playlist for a specific radio broadcast station, and the broadcast content description is produced. The broadcast content description may be a text description of the broadcast content that was playing at the time when the user activated the tag button. The broadcast content description is then posted to the user&apos;s private tag list web page that is accessible by the user. Using this method, specific content can be identified that was terrestrially broadcast, tuned to, and played on user&apos;s external radio tuner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the time the user activated tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The user can then access their private tag list web page and obtain the information about the content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the user connects the output signal from external radio tuner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In this example, the user has connected their home stereo tape monitor output to frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as specified above. The user also sets up frequency-matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on user&apos;s home LAN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is connected to gateway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that provides access to Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. While listening to a broadcast radio program on external radio tuner <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the user identifies a song that he likes, but is unaware of its title. The user pushes tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> on frequency matching device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in order to tag that song. In a few moments, the user can access his personal tag list web page using a browser on a PC with a connection to Internet <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and obtain information about the song that was being played when the user activated tag button <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The information included on a tag list web page may include song name, CD name, discography, lyrics, links to other web sites that feature that artist, artist background and history, concert schedule, links to e-commerce sites to purchase CDs or MP3s by that artist, and links to other artist web sites who are included in the same genre of music as the tagged artist. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, the car includes the frequency-matching device and a wireless LAN transceiver. When the car comes within range of the home wireless LAN, a connection between the car frequency-matching device and the home gateway is established. In this case, when the user activates the tag button while out of range of the home wireless LAN, the frequency-match value and the time and date are stored but not immediately downloaded to the Internet. However, the tag message is downloaded immediately after the car has established a connection to the home LAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In another implementation, the frequency-matching device is connected to a Wide Area Network (WAN) transceiver, such as a cellular phone system. In this case, when the user activates the tag button, the tag message is constructed and a connection is established between the cellular transceiver and a wireless cell. The tag message is then immediately sent through the cellular system to the tag-processing server on the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Alternative Embodiment: Digital Signal Comparison in Firmware </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A comparison between the internal and external radio signals is achieved through the use of a signal comparison algorithm executed in firmware on the microcontroller. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows that both internal and external tuned audio signals are pre-processed with an AC coupling circuit voltage divider circuit. The AC coupling circuit removes the DC component of the signals, and the voltage divider circuit centers the signals on a voltage between VDD and ground (GND). Both pre-processed signals are then connected to two analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, A/D converter A <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and A/D converter B <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, on the microcontroller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that convert the analog radio signal amplitude at an instant, into discrete digitized numbers. Each of the internal tuned audio signal and the external tuned audio radio signal are sampled several times during a fixed period of time (e.g. 1000 samples over 100 milli-seconds) and the digitized amplitude, values are stored in memory as paired data in two arrays. The following is a listing of software source code using the C programming language, for a digital signal comparison algorithm for determining if the external tuned audio signal and internal tuned audio signal are the same: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> This algorithm works by first calculating an average for each of the external tuned audio signal array of values and the internal radio signal array of values. Next, each value in each array is determined to be greater or lesser than the respective array average values. If the internal tuned audio signal array value and the external tuned audio signal array value are both simultaneously above or below their respective array averages, then it is assumed that the signals at that sample point are the same and a &ldquo;match&rdquo; value is incremented. After both arrays are processed in this way, if a majority of array values are similar in terms of being above or below the respective array average values, then the &ldquo;match&rdquo; variable will be incremented a large number of times. If a majority of array values are dis-similar in terms of being above or below the respective array averages, then the &ldquo;match&rdquo; variable will be decremented, unless it is already zero. If the &ldquo;match&rdquo; variable has been incremented over 750 times, then the &ldquo;match&rdquo; variable is given a logic 1 designation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The theoretical maximum value of the &ldquo;match&rdquo; variable is NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES, in this case, 1024. This number is used because it makes the divide function a bit-shift which requires far fewer processor cycles to execute. If the signals are identical, then the &ldquo;match&rdquo; variable will be incremented at each cycle of the comparison &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop. In practice, there may be a slight phase shift between the internal radio signal and the external radio signal due to differences in tuner circuitry in each radio. The last &ldquo;if&rdquo; conditional in the source code listing functions as a digital threshold filter for a match versus no-match decision. This threshold value is determined empirically through testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> There are many firmware algorithms that can be used to check if two digital signal waveforms are similar, and the above-mentioned algorithm should be regarded merely as an example of one such algorithm. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The frequency-matching device could also be implemented with an internal TV broadcast tuner in addition to or in place of the internal radio broadcast tuner. Thus terrestrial broadcast TV can be frequency-matched and tagged. The frequency-match device would only process the audio portions of the external TV broadcast tuner signal (the TV) and the internal TV broadcast tuner signal. The TV playlist is thus available to the tag-processing server application that cross-references the frequency-match value and the zip code. The rest of the process is the same as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the closed-captioning text signal that is combined in many TV broadcast signals could be used to match TV signals. This method would require minimal microprocessor cycles because the system is processing ASCII character text rather than working on an analog to digital conversion. The closed-caption system is similar in function to those described above except that the two text streams are compared rather than the audio signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A system and method for determining information related to broadcast content have been provided. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. </paragraph>
