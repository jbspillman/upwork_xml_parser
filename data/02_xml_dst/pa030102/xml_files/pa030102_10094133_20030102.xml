<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the delivery of content using a telecommunications network such as the Internet. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of serving content to a user that avoids the backbone and otherwise reduces congestion and delays in a telecommunications network, such as the Internet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Increasingly, content such as audio, images (moving and still) and multimedia presentations are being delivered electronically over the Internet. Users typically expect that high-quality audio and moving and still images will be delivered on demand, with the expected quality, and without interruption, delay or distortion. Meeting this expectation often requires the ability to send, receive and display content in real time so that users can experience the content as it was intended to be experienced, by the original producer. Content providers have thus developed systems and techniques to stream audio, video and multimedia content from their servers to their customers and other users in real time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Demand for Internet transmission capacity is expected to continue to grow. There are at least two reasons for this growth. First, the number of Internet users demanding streamed or real-time content is expected to increase. Second, the number of individuals and enterprises interested in producing and distributing content, and in particular high-quality audio and video content, is expected to increase, thereby increasing the amount of content available for streaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> If Internet transmission capacity is not sufficient to handle the demand for streaming, congestion will result, producing transmission delays and errors, which in turn will degrade the quality or timeliness, or both, of the content transmitted and presented to users. On the other hand, it can be costly and time-consuming to increase Internet capacity, including backbone resources such as transmission facilities (e.g., fiber optic cables), switches and routers, to meet expected or experienced increases in demand for transmission capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need to develop methods and systems for delivering content to a user connected to a network such as the Internet in a manner that avoids or at least reduces the potential for congestion on the backbone of that network. More specifically, there is a need to develop methods and systems for delivering content to users connected to a network, such as the Internet, without necessarily requiring use of the backbone or infrastructure of that network for each item of content requested by and delivered to users connected to that network. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a system and method for accelerated delivery of content items to a user of the Internet or other telecommunications network. In an embodiment, a method of the invention entails receiving a user access request from a user and redirecting the user to a service point, such that the requested content is served to the user from the service point. In an embodiment, the user access request specifies a content item from a plurality of content items and a user address from a plurality of user addresses, and the service point is selected responsive to the specified content item and user address. In an embodiment, a system of the invention uses a user address database, which relates user addresses to specific service points, and a content item database, which relates service points to content items. The user requesting content from a content provider is redirected to a service point associated with the user, which has the content item requested by the user, and from which the requested content item may be served to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to embodiments of the present invention, delays in serving content items over the Internet to users are significantly reduced, if not eliminated, by broadcasting content items to servers located at the edges of the Internet via satellite or other point-to-multipoint systems that do not substantially use the Internet. In such embodiments, the content item, which can include a substantial amount of information whose real-time transmission requires a substantial amount of transmission capacity, is not transmitted over the backbone of the Internet. In embodiments, each content item is distributed without using the backbone to a server or service at one or more network nodes, known as edges (e.g., Internet ISP nodes) proximate to users. A requested content item is not transmitted over the Internet backbone from the content provider to the user; rather, the user is sent a much smaller amount of information that directs the user to an edge node proximate to the particular user from which the requested content item will be served, again without using the backbone or infrastructure of the Internet. Accordingly, preferred strategies for distributing content items to nodes include the distribution of large numbers of content items to each edge&mdash;that is, to each node proximate to sets of users making requests for content items&mdash;before users actually make requests for those content items. Content items are thus advantageously positioned in advance to enable rapid and efficient responses to user requests for content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, a content-request redirection system of the present invention receives near real-time information on the disposition of content items at servers and services and receives near real-time information on the operational status and load of servers and other components and services at the edges. This information can include, for example, how many content streams the server can transmit, the delivery rate of each stream, and an amount of headroom assigned to the server in order to avoid overloads. Thus, in embodiments, selection of the location, server or service for serving content items in response to a user request may be based on one or a combination of factors, including the proximity of the server and the user, the availability and load of the server, the availability of the content item, and the cost of transmitting the content item from a server to the user. The distribution of content to edges, coupled with near real-time information on content item disposition, server status and load information and routing and transmission, enable embodiments of systems of the present invention to make intelligent and rapid decisions to redirect users to servers that can effectively and efficiently serve content items requested by the users, as if the user were being served the content item directly (e.g., via the Internet backbone) from the content provider&apos;s website. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user in a request for a content item (for example an HTTP request) is associated, for example in a source block table, with a node or location, which is included in a user address database and is used in redirecting a user to a node, service point, server or service in response to a request for content. In embodiments, the edge associated with the user IP address is the first choice for serving the requested content item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, service points or nodes may be arranged hierarchically in layers, such as a highest layer, one or more intermediate layers, and a lowest layer. In such an arrangement, nodes or service points could be classified so that edge nodes&mdash;i.e., nodes most proximate to users and therefore preferred in many embodiments for serving content to users&mdash;would be included in the lowest layer. Nodes or service points used to provide backup or failover protection for one or more edge nodes would be classified as regional nodes in an intermediate layer, and one or more nodes used to provide backup or failover for one or more regional nodes would be classified as center nodes in the highest layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to embodiments of the present invention, redirection is achieved in response to a user&apos;s request for a content item by sending the user the URL or other address where the content item is located and available for transmission in response to the request. In other embodiments, redirection is achieved by sending the user a container or file including the URL or other address of each content item responsive to the user&apos;s request. For example, a container may include both the URL of the requested content item and a URL of a specialized media player needed in order to play the content. In some embodiments of the invention, the URLs in a container are predetermined or &ldquo;hard coded.&rdquo; In other embodiments, a container may include a macro or other program that computes or determines the needed URL&mdash;including, in embodiments, in near real time in response to each specific user access request for content items&mdash;based on available information, including the locations and disposition of the content item, server load, and user preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a processor comprising program logic configuring the processor to (i) receive, via a first network, a user access request generated by a user specifying a content item of a plurality of content items and a user address, associated with the user, of a plurality of user addresses, and (ii) determine, responsive to the content item and the user address, a service point of a plurality of service points. The processor communicates with a user address database that relates the plurality of user addresses to the plurality of service points, and a content item database that relates the plurality of service points to the plurality of content items. Each of the plurality of content items is distributed, prior to receipt by the processor of the user access request, to at least one of the plurality of service points using a second network substantially separate from the first network. In embodiments of the present invention, the processor or other components (including for example other processors, servers, services, hardware, software or combinations thereof) comprise program logic or instructions to configure (or otherwise enable) the processor or component to perform the functions, steps and activities described in this specification and the appended claims for the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a transmitter for transmitting a plurality of signals to a processor using a first network, where the signals encode a user access request comprising a specification of a content item of a plurality of content items and a user address, associated with a user, of a plurality of user addresses. Program logic configures the processor to receive the user access request and determine, responsive to the content item and the user address, a service point of a plurality of service points. A user address database relates the plurality of user addresses to the plurality of service points, and a content item database relates the plurality of service points to the plurality of content items. Each of the plurality of content items is distributed, prior to receipt by the processor of the user access request, to at least one of the plurality of service points using a second network substantially separate from the first network. In some embodiments, the processor or other components (including for example other processors, servers, services, hardware, software or combinations thereof) comprise program logic or instructions to configure the processor or component to perform the functions, steps and activities described in this specification and the appended claims for systems and methods of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a system for redirecting computer network users comprising (i) means for receiving a user access request from a user, wherein the user access request specifies a content item of a plurality of content items and a user address of a plurality of user addresses and (ii) means for redirecting the user, using a first network, to a service point of a plurality of service points, responsive to the content item and the user address. A user address database relates the plurality of user addresses to the plurality of service points, and a content item database relates the plurality of service points to the plurality of content items. Each of the plurality of content items is distributed, prior to receipt of the user access request, to at least one of the plurality of service points using a second network substantially separate from the first network. The structures corresponding to the receiving means and the redirecting means include processors, servers, transmitters, receivers, computers, servers or other components, as apparent in view of this specification and the appended claims. </paragraph>

In preferred embodiments, an edge node refers to the service point which is the most proximate to the user, where proximity may be measured as described below. In embodiments, these associations, as well as a hierarchical arrangement between edge, regional, and center nodes, permit control over the strategy for determining which server should serve a content item in response to a user access request. In embodiments, a server or user is associated with only one edge node. Individual edge nodes may have individual properties that help direct the determination of the server that is to serve a content item in response to a user access request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Headroom&rdquo; refers to the difference between the total capacity of a server and the maximum target server load of that server. A server is assigned headroom so that its total capacity is hardly if ever exceeded in practice, so that users receiving content items from the server hardly if ever experience delays or other degradations due to overloading of the server. In embodiments, the amount of headroom for a server may be changed or reconfigured for a variety of reasons, including experience with actual loads on the server, changes in the number or size of content items on the server, the number of users served by the server, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Layer&rdquo; refers to a level in a hierarchy that defines relationships between a set of nodes.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> With reference to the figures, a detailed discussion is presented of illustrations and embodiments of the present invention. The invention, and embodiments of it, may be implemented using software, hardware or appropriate combinations of software and hardware, and the figures and examples in this specification are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention or its embodiments or equivalents. More specifically, the systems, components, services and interactions of a redirection system embodying the present invention may be implemented using hardware, software or appropriate combinations thereof, including processors, storage devices, transmitters, receivers and other suitable components in view of this specification and the appended claims. Similarly, communication, transmission, sending, reception or other transfer of information among components, systems, devices, services or servers depicted in the figures or described in this specification may be accomplished by any suitable means, including wire, cable, fiber optic, wireless, satellite radio, infrared, light or other means, without departing from the scope of the present invention. In addition, while the drawings and examples depict and use the Internet and a satellite system as networks for use in implementing the present invention, it will be appreciated that other networks and other types of networks, including public and private networks implemented using the techniques and technologies identified above, may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention provide accelerated delivery of content items to users. This is accomplished, in response to a user access request made using the Internet for particular content items, by redirecting the user from a content provider&apos;s web-site to a second location, for example an edge node, to which the requested content items have been distributed without using the Internet. In an embodiment, content items have been distributed to edge nodes using a satellite system. The second location&mdash;e.g., the edge node&mdash;is typically more proximate to the user than the content provider&apos;s web-site. Accordingly, delivery of content items from the edge node avoids potential congestion and other problems associated with serving content items over the Internet backbone, and is designed to provide the user with a content delivery experience that the user expects as if the content items were served without congestion from the content provider&apos;s site. In an embodiment, each edge node is colocated with an ISP access point for serving a set of users, and each edge node is designated for serving the same set of users as served by the ISP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> provide overviews of how embodiments of the invention process a user access request for a content item. In a simple embodiment, when a user clicks on a hyperlink at a content provider&apos;s site that refers to the content item, the user is automatically and transparently directed to an IRE as part of normal HTTP processing, and the user&apos;s browser issues an HTTP GET instruction to the IRE for the desired content item. The IRE determines the most proximate server where the content Item is available and directs the user to that server for the content item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> simple embodiment can comprise User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, Content Provider (&ldquo;CP&rdquo;) site <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> user access request (in this depiction HTTP GET <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>) to CP site <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> causes Hypertext Reference (&ldquo;HREF&rdquo;) instruction <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to be sent to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, which automatically and transparently directs User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to transmit information in the user access request to IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. This transmission is HTTP GET <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which, like HTTP GET <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, includes the user address and a specification of the content item. In response, IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> sends Redirect instruction <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, redirecting User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to initiate the specified Content Item Transfer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> from Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> submits a user access request for a content item by making an input on his Internet browser, either by typing in a URL or by clicking on a hyperlink at a CP site <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, thereby generating HTTP GET <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, the request by User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> travels over the Internet to CP site <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, which has an arrangement with a redirection system including IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to provide redirection services. In other embodiments (not depicted) a user access request may be submitted by other signaling and telecommunications means, including for example voice entry and recognition or telephone keypad signaling. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, CP site <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> returns HREF <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, which directs User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to an IRE of the redirection system. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the redirection system includes a single IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. (An example of a redirection system with multiple IREs is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>.) Upon receiving HREF <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> generates HTTP GET <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and transmits it to IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, this generation and transmission are automatic and transparent to the operator of User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>&apos;s browser or other system. HTTP GET <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> includes information about the user address and the content item specified in the user access request. Using this information in combination with information stored in databases available to IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> determines the edge node associated with User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and proximate to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that includes a server that has the requested content item. For example, after IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> has determined the edge node proximate to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> determines, based on information stored in a content item database (not depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>), whether one or more servers at that edge node has the requested content item. If so, User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is redirected to one of those servers. For example, in the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has been redirected to Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> located at Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> communicate via Content Item Transfer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to serve the requested content item to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> runs as a multi-threaded Java servlet in the context of a fast, lightweight HTTP server and Java servlet manager. The HTTP server handles HTTP requests and forwards HTTP GET instructions to databases and processors in or available to IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> that issue HTTP redirect instructions, as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, or issue container files enabling redirection instructions to users to be written, as explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> depicts the information flows depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> in case diagram form. User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> transmits HTTP GET <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> to Content Provider <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, requesting a content item. Content Provider <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> responds with HREF <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, instructing User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to request the location of the content item from IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> then transmits HTTP GET <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which determines that Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) is proximate to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and that Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> has the content item. IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> then responds with HTTP Redirection instruction <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, providing User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> with the address of the content item in Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> of Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Through Content Item Transfer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> communicate in order to serve the requested content item to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment (not depicted), nodes may be arranged hierarchically in layers. In an example of such an arrangement, (a) one or more edge nodes would comprise the lowest layer; (b) one or more regional nodes would comprise an intermediate layer with each edge node associated with a single edge node; and (c) a center node would comprise the highest layer, with each regional node associated with a single center node. Each node may house one or more servers, depending on projected traffic, storage requirements, security considerations and the like, from which content items may be served to users. In embodiments, an edge node is colocated with or located at a location proximate to the location from which an ISP serves a specified set of users. For example, the first access point for a specified set of users of an ISP may be a point of presence (&ldquo;POP&rdquo;) maintained by the ISP at a physical location. In an embodiment, servers are colocated with and connected to the ISP&apos;s POP, and are configured to be able to communicate with the specified set of users served from the ISP&apos;s POP. In such an embodiment, the location of the ISP&apos;s POP and the servers is designated as an edge or an edge node. In an embodiment, content items located at an edge node are only served to users who are associated with the ISP whose POP serves as the location of the edge node. In embodiments, a regional node communicates with a plurality of edge nodes and thus can potentially serve users of a plurality of different ISPs. In embodiments, a center node communicates with a plurality of regional nodes, and thus can potentially serve an even wider array of users. As is apparent in view of this specification and the claims, the present invention may be implemented using alternate hierarchies and arrangements of layers. The redirection system could operate such nodes, or could have appropriate arrangements with ISPs or other operators of edge, regional or center nodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In an example of the arrangement described above involving three layers, if the requested content item is not at the edge node associated with the user requesting the content item, then an IRE would determine whether the requested content item is at a regional node associated with the edge node. If the content item is at the regional node, the user would be redirected to a server at the regional node having the requested content item. If the content item is also not found at this regional node, the user would be redirected to and served from the center node associated with the regional node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the invention uses a container file to specify to the user where to obtain the various components that may be needed in order to retrieve, play or process the one or more content items requested by the user or might otherwise be designated for the user in response to a user access request. For example, a media player might be needed in order to play a requested content item; or a advertisement might be needed from another web-site in order to be inserted into a banner space in a content item. In such cases, the user would be served with a container file that provides the appropriate addresses for the different components of the response to the user access request. As explained in more detail below, the contents of a container file may be generated in several ways. For example each of the elements of a container file could be retrieved from a database at an IRE or available on a shared basis with an IRE and other components of a redirection system embodying the present invention. As another example, each of the elements of a content file could be retrieved, along with the content items themselves, from appropriate storage at an edge node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In another example, the addresses in a content file of content items, players and other components could be determined &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; in near real time upon receipt of a user access request, in response to factors such as congestion and other conditions including server health and server load at relevant edge nodes, the disposition of content items at relevant nodes, and information in a user profile. In this example, generic container files could be centrally stored in the redirection system, with macros or other programs that could be executed at the time of a user access request to provide the URL of each content item, player or other application or file identified by the container file as responsive to the user access request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In a further example, and again with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> container file could be stored at Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> at Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, with the container file specifying Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (or another server) as the location of the content items identified in the container. In this example, when a user access request is received by IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, it does not serve a container file to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Rather, IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> transmits an HTTP redirect instruction (such as Redirect instruction <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> ) to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, giving the address of Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> as the location of a container file responsive to the user access request. This container file could be hard coded with the URL of Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (or another server). If a requested content item is not at Server <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, however, the container file could also be hard coded with the address of another server, a regional node or a center node where the requested content item is available to be served to User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts an embodiment of a system and method of the present invention for distributing content items to edge nodes and other nodes in a manner that does not require use of the Internet or other network used to handle user access requests (including for example HTTP, HREF and redirect information flows depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGs. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>). In an embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, Wide Area Network (&ldquo;WAN&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is an ATM-based network consisting of permanent virtual circuits of varying throughputs. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, content items are placed at both or either of Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A and Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B in a manner that bypasses the Internet <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. Content Providers <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>C, for example under agreement with a provider of a redirection service, provide content items to WAN <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, which passes them, through permanent virtual circuits that do not use Internet <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, to Network Operations Center (&ldquo;NOC&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. From NOC <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, the content items&mdash;along with instructions on where to place them&mdash;are sent to Satellite System <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. These instructions are designed to effectuate the goals of the redirection system of accelerating the delivery of content items to users. Particular sets of instructions will be apparent in view of this specification and the appended claims. For example, in an embodiment, the instructions would direct the distribution of each content item to at least one server at each edge node, regional node and center node in order to assure minimal delay in the delivery of content items to users. In other embodiments, the instructions for particular content items could reflect an agreement between the content provider of those items and the operator of a redirection system embodying the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, based on instructions from NOC <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, Satellite System <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> broadcasts the content items and storage instructions to each of Edge Nodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B, bypassing Internet <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, the storage instructions from NOC instruct which Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A or Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B, or both to store each content item transmitted via Satellite System <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment implemented on a global scope, a system implementing the present invention may comprise as many as 25,000 or more servers, in 5,000 or more nodes. In an embodiment, Satellite System <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, including Network Operations Center <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, is available from and operated by PanAmSat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> presents an overview of components of an embodiment of a system according to the present invention. As described in more detail below, the system comprises IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, having a Front End <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and a Back End <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and User Address Database <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. These databases contain information read by IRE Front End <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and used to determine the server to which a user will be redirected for a requested content item, for example as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each Smart Proxy Agent (&ldquo;SPA&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>C is associated with one or more servers at a node, and provides information to BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> concerning the health of each server associated with the SPA, as well as the disposition of content items stored on each of those servers. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, Broadcast Management System (&ldquo;BMS&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> provides information to BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> on the placement of content items at various servers and nodes. In embodiments, BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> receives this information from NOC <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> receives updated information on user addresses, including information on the users associated with each node, from Automated Source Block System (&ldquo;ASB&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> uses the information received from these sources to update Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and User Address Database <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> receives information relating to server health and content disposition from each SPA <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>C, information relating to content placement from BMS <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, and updated source block information (e.g., user address information) from ASB <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> uses the information received from these sources to update Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and User Address Database <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> through IRE Back End <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> For example, Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> appears, when read by IRE Front End <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> for redirection determinations, as a &ldquo;static table&rdquo; that contains data regarding where (i.e., on which server, and/or edge node) each content item can be found. When BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> receives a report from BMS <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> or from a SPA <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>B or <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>C necessitating a change in Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (for example, that a particular content item has been placed at a particular location, or that a given server is not available), BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> sends that information to IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which updates Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> from Back End <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> accordingly. Similarly, User Address Database <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> appears to IRE Front End <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> as a static table that contains data associating sets of users with particular edge nodes. When BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> receives information from ASB <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> that updates the association between users and edges (for example, adding or deleting users), BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> sends that information to IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which updates User Address Database <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> from Back End <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As a result of configurations like the one depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an IRE according to the present invention has available to it, in near real time if desired, updated information on the location of users, the association of users to nodes, the status of servers, the location and disposition of content items, and other information needed to make redirection determinations in response to user access requests. By separating the functions of updating and accessing the relevant databases&mdash;that is, updating through a &ldquo;back end&rdquo; engine, and accessing for redirection determinations through a &ldquo;front end&rdquo; engine&mdash;the databases can be accessed for redirection determinations essentially as if they were static, which further increases the speed of the redirection process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A more detailed topology of components of an embodiment of a system implementing the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an embodiment of the system comprises a plurality of centrally located components, including BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, Operator Interface (&ldquo;OI&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>; IREs <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C; IRE Load Balancer (&ldquo;ILB&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>; Secondary ILB <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>; BMS <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>; and ASB <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>; and a plurality of distributed components located at Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A (including SPA <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>A, Smart Probes <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>B and EDMs <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>B); Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B (including SPA <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>B, Smart Probes <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>D and EDMs <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>D); and Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>C (including SPA <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>C, Smart Probe <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>E and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>F and EDMs <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>E and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>F). In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and Secondary ILB <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> are configured for communication with User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is a multi-threaded, multi-protocol engine that acts as a central messaging and control mechanism for the system. As discussed above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> supplies information to IREs <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C on which they base their redirection determinations, including information relating to conditions at Edge Nodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>C, such as server status and health, load information and content item disposition. BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> receives information relating to conditions at Edge Nodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>C (such as server health, server load, content item disposition) from SPAs <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>C, which in turn receive information from Smart Probes <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>B located on servers at Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A, Smart Probes <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>D located on servers at Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B and Smart Probes <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>E and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>F located at Edge Node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>C. In addition, SPAs <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>C pass information from EDMs <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>B, EDMs <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>D and EDMs <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>E and <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>F, respectively, to BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> receives information that relates user address information to specific edge nodes from ASB <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. The relationships and interactions between BRAMs and ASB systems is described in more detail below with reference to with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The relationships and interactions between servers, smart probes, edge data managers, and smart proxy agents is discussed in more detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, OI <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> enables an operator manually to communicate with BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, for example to configure BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> or manually to access and/or make changes to the databases maintained by BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, OI <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is a Java application. In appropriately configured embodiments, BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> is coupled to Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and User Address Database <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) via a JDBC interface (depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as Back End <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> ). In an embodiment, information can also be entered into Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and User Item Database <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> directly by means of SQL statements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> also exchanges information with BMS <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> about the placement of content items. In an embodiment, software for the BMS is written in object oriented programming code, such as portable Java. In an embodiment, components of a redirection system of the invention communicate with each other over TCP or UDP and may use a protocol developed for the purpose. A suitable protocol is BRAM-talk protocol, available from BBN Technologies, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> Moulton Street, Cambridge, Mass. <highlight><bold>02138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, IRE Load Balancer (&ldquo;ILB&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and Secondary ILB <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> (with Secondary ILB <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> serving as a backup to ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> ) serve to balance the load between IREs <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C. In embodiments, ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and Secondary ILB <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> detect failures of an IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B or <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C, and provide failover protection by directing traffic away from a failed or overloaded IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B or <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, each of ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and Secondary ILB <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> comprises a DNS server and an IRE Health Check agent (&ldquo;IHC&rdquo;) (not depicted). The receipt by ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, for example, of a user access request from User <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> causes ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> to look up the domain name of an IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, equipped with a Domain Name Server (&ldquo;DNS&rdquo;), adapted as apparent in light of this specification, returns the IP address of each of IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C in a round robin fashion. In embodiments, the TTL (time to live) of the DNS address record of the IRE domain name is quite small, for example 20 seconds by default, so that when users return very quickly, another lookup is not required from the primary DNS of ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. Users that return in longer time frames may be directed to another IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C, thus helping to balance the load among IREs <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, failover protection is provided in connection with an IRE Health Check System (&ldquo;IHC&rdquo;), which can either be part of the DNS Server of ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, for example, or run as a separate process. In embodiments, the IHC periodically obtains health information from one or more IREs <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C. In embodiments, the health information is sent via site-scoped multicasting, which eliminates the need for a separate communication protocol to be opened between an IRE and an ILB; the IHC simply multicasts a signal, without any need to know what component will receive it. The multicast signals from the IHC may be periodic, and in the form of a heartbeat indicating presence, and may also indicate that the next heartbeat will be heard in a specified interval. If, after the specified interval, ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> or Secondary ILB <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> has not heard the heartbeat again, the IHC directs ILB <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> or Secondary ILB <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> to select another one of IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>B, or <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>C for handling further user access requests, and removes the failed IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> from the ILB server&apos;s round-robin list. An ILB that would serve the purpose of the present invention can be configured, as is apparent in view of this specification, from a smart switch with a failover protocol, such as the Series <highlight><bold>11000</bold></highlight> switch available from Cisco Systems, Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> together provide a flow diagram depicting the response of an embodiment of an illustrative IRE according to the present invention to an illustrative user access request. As discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in embodiments of the present invention, when a user makes a user access request to a content provider site, the request is redirected in the form of a HTTP reference to an IRE (such as IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). From the HTTP reference, the IRE extracts user ID information associated with the user, as well as content information identifying the requested content item. From User Address Database <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> (depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), the IRE can determine the source block associated with the user. As used in this specification, a source block refers to a mapping of a group of user addresses to a node. In embodiments, a source block maps a group of user IP addresses to an edge node, a regional node and/or a center node. Accordingly, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, Start <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> identifies the point at which Source Block <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and the URL of the requested content item, associated with its URL_PATH, have been identified by an IRE based on the user access request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> From Source Block <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, in embodiments an IRE can determine whether the user is associated with an edge node or regional node in a particular redirection system. If so, the user may be said to be &ldquo;in footprint&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>). If not, the user is said to be &ldquo;out of footprint&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>). In embodiments content items are served out of footprint from a center node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, Source Block <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> can also yield a path-prefix, if one is assigned, for the range of IP addresses mapped by Source Block <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. This allows special directories to be established for serving specific content to specific sets of users based on their IP address range (which could be a single IP address). Accordingly, in an embodiment, Source Block <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> yields User Attributes <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> for each user whose address is in the range mapped by Source Block <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. User Attributes <highlight><bold>513</bold></highlight> may comprise information, read by the IRE, that plays a role in the IRE&apos;s determination of the server from which to serve the content item requested by the user. For example, in the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, attributes include &ldquo;Alt Path Only&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>), &ldquo;Alt Then Default&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>), &ldquo;Default Only&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight>), &ldquo;Local Only&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>), &ldquo;Regional Only&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>), &ldquo;Center Only&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>) and &ldquo;Block&rdquo; (<highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight>). In this example, a normal or default path and an alternate path are specified for serving content items to a user. These paths may differ in characteristics such as transmission speed, bit error rate and cost. If &ldquo;Alt Path Only&rdquo; attribute <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> is selected, the content item will be served to the user only from the alternate path; if the content item is not available via the alternate path, the user will not be served. Alt Path Only attribute <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> can be useful in cases where the user has specified that she will only accept content above a specified quality. If Alt Then Default attribute <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> is selected, the system (e.g., the IRE) first checks to see if the requested content item is available on the alternate path; if the content item is not available over the alternate path, the user is served over the default or normal path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> a path-prefix to the URL_PATH provides the ability to serve different content items to a certain set of users. For instance, in some embodiments, an out-of-footprint user requesting a content item may receive a response that includes a brief excerpt of the content item at the transmission speed for in-footprint users, then a short hypertext note, followed by the full content item at a slower transmission speed, thereby providing a demonstration of the advantages of becoming an in-footprint user. In other embodiments, in-footprint users who pay a special fee could receive content items at higher quality streams. In yet other embodiments, users can be segregated and served differently based on their geographic location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, &ldquo;Local Only,&rdquo; &ldquo;Regional Only&rdquo; and &ldquo;Center Only,&rdquo; attributes <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> can be used to specify that a user (or group of users in a source block) are served from a node in a designated layer and not from a node in a different layer. &ldquo;Block&rdquo; attribute <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> may be used to prevent a user from receiving certain content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Specifically, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, an IRE at step <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> determines whether an Alt Path Attribute (in this example, Alt Path Only attribute <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> or Alt Then Default attribute <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight>) has been set. If the answer is no, or if Default Only attribute <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> is set, then at step <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight>, a Default Path prefix is prepended to the URL_PATH, and the IRE checks at decision box <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> whether a container is available for the requested content item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, a container is a file that includes a playlist comprising a list of URLs, where each URL specifies the location (including the server) of each content item responsive to a user access request. In embodiments, a container also includes the URL of an application needed to play or otherwise process the corresponding content item. In embodiments, each URL in a container is hard coded, that is, specified in advance of the use of the container and is expected to change infrequently. In other embodiments, the URL of one or more content items (or applications) in a container are determined as a result of the execution of a macro or other program whose resulting URL (including for example, the URL of another container) may depend on a variety of inputs, such as path information, user profile information, and server health and load information. For example, a macro for a content item in a container responsive to a user access request may determine that the user is also to receive an advertisement as a trailer to the content item or that, because of the load at the time on servers at the edge node otherwise most proximate to the user, the content item should be served from another node. As discussed below, a macro in a container may also have as input information from a user profile, which, for example, enables the user to be served Pay-Per-View or special event content items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, the IRE scans the container file for the macro keywords (for example, the characters &ldquo;$$IP&lsqb;:PORT&rsqb;$$&rdquo;) and replaces them with the IP address associated with a URL_PATH server and port if a port is specified in the IRE tables. After rewriting the container file, the IRE looks up the type of content corresponding to that container from its internal tables or from the extension in the content file name extracted from the URL in the HTTP GET request and determines the corresponding MIME type for type of content for the requested content item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, any or all of the redirection determinations, the container file served to the user, or the contents of the container file served to the user, may depend on user profile information, including age, gender, content or other preferences, income or other information about users that may be useful or desirable in offering content, features or options to users of a redirection system of the present invention. For example, if parents have determined that certain types of content are not to be served to their home computer, this could be reflected in a user profile corresponding to that computer. As another example, information in a user&apos;s profile could trigger a response to a macro in a container that would redirect the user to alternate content, or a different version (e.g., in a different language or with subtitles) of the content specified by the user. As a further example, in response to user profile information an IRE could select a container customized to the particular user that would include references for example to advertising content specifically tailored or responsive to the user profile for insertion into a content item requested by the user, or might include content item entries for the particular user that would not be found in a container retrieved in response to a different user&apos;s request. Thus, embodiments of the system and method of the present invention can provide tailored content redirection, optionally in a manner transparent to the user, responsive to user profile information as well as a user address and a requested content item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, a container may include encrypted information or a URL or macro that determines a URL of encrypted information. For example, a container may include an encrypted counter that keeps track of a balance in a deposit account that is to be debited if the user selects a content item that is available on a pay per view, subscription or other charge basis. When the user selects such a content item, the counter or account balance could be reduced by the appropriate amount, either automatically or in response to a password entry by the user. When the counter or account balance is reduced to a predetermined level, the user could be automatically prompted to enter appropriate information, such as a credit card or debit card number, to increase the count or account balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> User profile information can be made available in a number of ways to a redirection system embodying the present invention. In an embodiment, if a user access request includes a user address not included in the user address database(s) of the system, then the user could be presented with a dialog screen that would request and obtain profile information, which would be stored for tailored content redirection, as described above. Users who had provided profile information could also be prompted periodically to update their profile information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, a component of the system, for example a SPA at a node associated with a user by an ASB System, could include a database that keeps track of the content items requested by the user. This information for example could be included with the user&apos;s profile information, and redirection determinations could also be responsive to this information or could be used to suggest to the user content items instead of or in addition to the content items selected by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, at step <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight> an IRE determines whether a container is available in connection with a user access request. This typically entails accessing a content item database (such as Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to determine whether the requested content item is available on a server in a node. If a container is not available&mdash;which may occur for example if the link to the content provider is out of date, or if there is system configuration error&mdash;the IRE generates Alert <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, based on an HTTP <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> Return Code (step <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight>) for example, and processing stops at step <highlight><bold>591</bold></highlight>. In embodiments, if a container is not available, the IRE or other component also generates a site-scoped multicast message to inform a BRAM or other components, services or applications of the condition. Returning to step <highlight><bold>533</bold></highlight>, if a container is available, the processing of the user access request continues at step <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> by way of flow chart connector P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Returning to step <highlight><bold>529</bold></highlight> of the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, if a Alt Path Attribute is set, then at step <highlight><bold>539</bold></highlight> the IRE prepends the Alt Path-Prefix to the URL_PATH, and checks at step <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> to see if a container is available for the requested content item in the alternate path. If a container is not available in the alternate path, and the Alt Path Only attribute <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> has been set (and consequently that the Alt Then Default attribute <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> has not been set), at step <highlight><bold>537</bold></highlight> the IRE generates HTTP <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> Return Code and Alert <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>, processing stops (step <highlight><bold>591</bold></highlight>) and the user will not receive the content item. In an embodiment, the return code informs the network (for example BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>) that the requested content item is not available at the alternate path, and which in turn prompts an appropriate component (again such as BRAM <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>) to take action to correct the condition for future user access requests. If the container is available on the alternate path, processing continues at step <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> via flow chart connector P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Returning to step <highlight><bold>541</bold></highlight> of the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, if the container is not available on the alternate path, and if the IRE determines at step <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> that the Alt Then Default attribute <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> has been set, then at step <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> the IRE prepends the Default Path prefix to the URL_PATH and proceeds from step <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> in the manner described above for cases where Alt Path attribute <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> or Alt Then Default attribute <highlight><bold>517</bold></highlight> have not been set, or Default Only attribute <highlight><bold>519</bold></highlight> has been set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, in the case using either the default path or the alternate path, if a container is available, then at step <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> the IRE determines whether the container needs to be rewritten. This may be done by scanning the container for macros, which indicate the presence of soft-coded URLs. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, if the IRE determines that the container does not need to be rewritten (i.e., that it contains only hard coded URLs), at step <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight> it next checks if Block attribute <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> has been set in order to block the user from viewing the requested content. If Block attribute <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> has not been set, then the IRE serves the container to the user&apos;s browser (step <highlight><bold>547</bold></highlight>), and the user&apos;s browser accesses the requested content items (including, as appropriate, players) based on the URLs in the container, and processing stops at step <highlight><bold>597</bold></highlight>. If Block attribute <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> has been set to block the user from viewing the requested content, the user is blocked from viewing it, and at step <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> the user receives a message explaining the block, and processing stops (step <highlight><bold>595</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Continuing with the exemplary embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, if at step <highlight><bold>543</bold></highlight> the IRE detects macros in the container&mdash;signifying the presence of soft-coded URLs&mdash;the IRE considers at step <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight> whether the user is out of footprint and thus in this embodiment is to be served from a center node. If the user is out of footprint, the IRE at step <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> checks if Block attribute <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> has been set in order to block the user from viewing the requested content. If Block attribute <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> has been set, the user is blocked, at step <highlight><bold>548</bold></highlight> the user receives a message to that effect, and at step <highlight><bold>595</bold></highlight> processing stops. Returning to step <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight>, if Block attribute <highlight><bold>527</bold></highlight> has not been set, the IRE determines whether the requested content item is at the center node (step <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight>). If so, then at step <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> the IRE rewrites the container file with URLs specifying the location(s) of the requested content item (and players) and at step <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight> serves the container to the user, who has now been redirected from a content provider to the center node. At step <highlight><bold>596</bold></highlight> processing would then stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Returning to step <highlight><bold>549</bold></highlight> of the exemplary embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, if the user is determined to be in footprint, the IRE evaluates Local Only attribute <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, Regional Only attribute <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, and Center Only attribute <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> to determine how to process the user request further for each piece of content specified in the container file. For example, if Regional Only attribute <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> has been set, then Serve From Local Node&quest; step <highlight><bold>559</bold></highlight> would return &ldquo;No,&rdquo; as would Serve From Center Node&quest; step <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight>, while Serve From Regional Node&quest; step <highlight><bold>563</bold></highlight> would return &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Under such circumstances, the IRE would at step <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> check a content item database (such as Content Item Database <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to determine whether the requested content item is in a regional node. If so, the IRE would in embodiments rewrite the container file (step <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight>) and at step <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight> serve the rewritten container file to the user. If, at step <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight>, it is determined that the requested content item is not at a regional node, then processing would continue at step <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight>, where Serve From Center Node&quest; <highlight><bold>531</bold></highlight> would return a &ldquo;No,&rdquo; in this example, since Regional Only attribute <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> has been set. Then, at step <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> the user would receive an appropriate message and processing would stop at step <highlight><bold>593</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Continuing with the exemplary embodiment, if none of Local Only attribute <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, Regional Only attribute <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> and Center Only attribute <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is set, then Serve From Local&quest; step <highlight><bold>559</bold></highlight> returns a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; value, and the IRE determines, at step <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight>, whether the requested content item is available at the local (or edge) node (including, for example, whether the local (or edge) node is operational). If so, then at step <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> the IRE rewrites the container to specify the local (or edge) node and proximate server for the content item, and at step <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight> serves the rewritten container to the user, and at step <highlight><bold>596</bold></highlight> processing stops. If the IRE determines at step <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> that the requested content item is not available at the local (or edge) node, then it proceeds to Serve From Regional Node&quest; step <highlight><bold>563</bold></highlight>, which would return a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; value since, in this example, neither Local Only attribute <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> nor Center Only attribute <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is set. The IRE would then determine, at step <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight>, whether the requested content item is available at the regional node. If so, then at step <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> the IRE rewrites the container to specify the regional node and proximate server for the content item, and at step <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight> serves the rewritten container to the user, and at step <highlight><bold>596</bold></highlight> processing stops. If the IRE determines at <highlight><bold>565</bold></highlight> that the requested content item is not available at the regional node, then it proceeds to Serve From Center Node&quest; step <highlight><bold>561</bold></highlight>, which returns a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; value since in this case Local Only attribute <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight> and Regional Only attribute <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> are not set. The IRE then determines at step <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight> whether the requested content item is available at the center node. If so, the container is rewritten at step <highlight><bold>555</bold></highlight> to specify the center node and proximate server for the requested content item, and at step <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight> the container is served to the user, and at step <highlight><bold>596</bold></highlight> processing stops. If the IRE determines that the requested content item is not available at the center node, then at step <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> a message is sent informing the user that the requested content item is not available and at step <highlight><bold>593</bold></highlight> processing stops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> provides an overview of exemplary component relationships and information flows which may be used to update user addresses in an embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, a user address database in an IRE (such as IRE <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>), comprises a plurality of source blocks, where each source block maps a set of user addresses to a node. The user address database may be updated through BGP information from ISPs participating in the system of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, BGP Speaker <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> receives BGP information from BGP Speaker <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> associated with ISP <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, from BGP Speaker <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> associated with ISP <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, and from BGP Speaker <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> associated with ISP <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, BGP information comprises routing information, including routing policies and protocols for reaching blocks of user addresses. In embodiments, each ISP participating in a redirection system of the present invention supports the same or a similar BGP protocol. In embodiments, BGP information includes information about users, such as the type or quality of link between a user and her ISP. In embodiments, BGP information can include cost information on use of links or routes, which may be used, as described in this specification, in making redirection determinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, BGP Speaker <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> consolidates the information received from BGP <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>, BGP <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> and BGP <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight>, and transmits the consolidated BGP information to ASB <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> in the form of a BGP table. ASB <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> receives BGP information from BGP Speaker <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, and converts that BGP information into source blocks which associate each set of user addresses with an edge node or another node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, ASB <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> also combines the source blocks into source block tables, which it transmits to BRAM <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> (which in this embodiment corresponds to BRAM <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in embodiments ASB <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> also transmits alarms and alerts as site-scoped multicasted messages, for example if a source block cannot be created from BGP information, if a source block table cannot be transmitted to BRAM <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>, if a source block is deleted, or if other events occur warranting an alert or an alarm. As also depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in embodiments ASB <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> records its transactions, including receipt of BGP information and transmission of source blocks, to Log <highlight><bold>691</bold></highlight>, and to Operator File <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> for inspection and editing by an operator, who can modify both Operator File <highlight><bold>641</bold></highlight> and corresponding records in BRAM <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>. In embodiments, ASB <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> is a single process application, implemented in a combination of hardware and software, that can be run at scheduled times, or as a continuously running process that wakes up at scheduled times and fetches the BGP information from BGP Speaker <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, source block tables are transmitted from ASB <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> to BRAM <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, BRAM <highlight><bold>651</bold></highlight> also records the source block tables in Database <highlight><bold>661</bold></highlight>. BRAM <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> also transmits the source block tables to IRE <highlight><bold>681</bold></highlight>, which uses the source block tables to make redirection determinations, as described above. Thus, in embodiments of the present invention, source block tables used for redirection determinations can be updated automatically and in near real time as changes are made for example in users, user addresses, server and server locations, and transmission paths between users and servers. </paragraph>

As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> manages and provides content disposition information to SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> for a node such as an edge node. In an embodiment, each server at an edge is equipped with an EDM. In another embodiment, each device such as a disk drive storing content items at a node is equipped with an EDM. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> provides content disposition information for a server, such as information on the availability of content items at the server and the size of the content item file. For example, when a content item is successfully positioned at the server associated with EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> also sends a message to SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> indicating that the content item has been successfully delivered. In embodiments, EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> also sends alerts and alarms to SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. In embodiments, there is a persistent connection between EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> and SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> provides information to SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> concerning the status, health and load of a server in a node, for example, the same server associated with EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>. In embodiments, this information includes alerts and alarms, which are sent to SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> via site-scoped multicasting. In embodiments, Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> sends a heartbeat signal to SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>: failure to receive the heartbeat signal at the predetermined interval indicates failure or serious malfunction of the server associated with Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>. Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> may be an application program that resides on its own system; in other embodiments, Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> may be an application program that resides on a server at a node. In an embodiment, at least one SPA is located at each node, including each edge node. In embodiments, SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is a multi-threaded Java process that provides both core functionality, such as the ability to add plugins or other application programs to monitor the availability, load and status of various metrics for the server, and to provide statistics and other information concerning server performance, and the ability to launch scripts or other executable programs on command or in response to alerts, alarms, server load levels and other metrics and events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> sends information from EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> and Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> to BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. This includes content disposition information received from EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> and server status, health and load information from Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>. In embodiments, SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> transmits information to BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> when there is a change in the information received by SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> from EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> or Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>. In embodiments, SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> sends alerts and alarms via site-scoped multicasting so that a number of system components may become aware of the event triggering the alert or alarm. In an embodiment, SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> may also field alerts and alarms from other elements, components or applications at a node, and transmit those alerts and alarms to BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> maintains an open TCP connection, which may be tunneled through a Virtual Private Network, to BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> may be configured to send a heartbeat signal to BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, so that failure of BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> to receive the signal within a predetermined period would indicate a failure or serious malfunction of SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> or the node at which it resides. In embodiments including a number of servers, each having an SPA, a BRAM is provided with essentially real-time information concerning the disposition of content items as well as the status, health and load of each server having a SPA. In other embodiments (not depicted), a SPA or other component may communicate messages with a BRAM without processing or evaluating the content of the message, thus utilizing a BRAM, SPA or other component as a functionally passive switch or conduit for messages between system components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in embodiments BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> also communicates to BMS <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> the content disposition and load, status and health of the server associated with SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> may also receive initial or run-time configuration information such as the IP addresses of the servers at the node, the types of content served by those servers, the port from which the content is served, heartbeat interval and server load or headroom thresholds. In other embodiments (not depicted), BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> may also communicate this information to other components, functions and services of a redirection system of the present invention, such as one or more IREs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment (not depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> also communicates messages, including for example status requests and headroom reconfiguration instructions, to SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and to EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> and Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> through SPA <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. For example, a BMS may determine, as a result of traffic analysis for example, that the headroom of one of the servers at a node should be increased. In an embodiment, the BMS could send a message to that effect to BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, which would transmit the message to a SPA of the appropriate node, which could also direct execution of the headroom change for the designated server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> may be implemented as a multi-protocol, mutli-threaded system that acts as a message switch for components and parts of a redirection system of the present invention. BRAM <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> may also maintain a database of information concerning the configuration of the redirection system; source block tables; the location and status of content items; IRE, SPA and other component configuration information; and other information necessary or useful for the operation of the redirection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> depicts exemplary component relationships and information flows that could be set up between a SPA, an EDM, a set of smart probes and a set of servers in an embodiment of a system of the present invention including a smart switch. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, SPA <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is in communication with each of Smart Probes <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight> and with EDM <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> of Node <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. Smart Probe <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight> is in communication with Server <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>, Smart Probe <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> is in communication with Server <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> and Smart Probe <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight> is in communication with Server <highlight><bold>853</bold></highlight>. These smart probes function similarly to Smart Probe <highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>, and EDM <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> functions similarly to EDM <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, both as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, however, SPA <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is also in communication with Smart Switch <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> As described above, in embodiments of systems and methods of the present invention without a smart switch, an IRE redirects a user access request to a particular server. In other embodiments, as reflected in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an IRE can redirect a user access request to a component&mdash;a smart switch&mdash;at an edge or other node, which determines which server at that node is &ldquo;best&rdquo; according to predetermined criteria, such as the availability or load of the servers at the node with the requested content item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, each server at an edge or other node is associated with a smart switch that has a list of the servers at the edge. Accordingly, in the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, each of Server <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>, Server <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> and Server <highlight><bold>853</bold></highlight> is associated with Smart Switch <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight>. User access requests redirected to Node <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> are initially handled by Smart Switch <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight>, which routes incoming redirected user access requests to Server <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>, Server <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> or Server <highlight><bold>853</bold></highlight> in round robin fashion. Other methods for distributing user access requests, for example based on the load of Servers <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>853</bold></highlight> (as reported by Smart Probes <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>, respectively, through SPA <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> to Smart Switch <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> ) at the time of each access request, are apparent in light of this specification and the appended claims. If SPA <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> or EDM <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> reports that one of these servers is not available, then Smart Switch <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> does not pass user access requests to that server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, each of Servers <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>853</bold></highlight> stores and can serve the same set of content items. In another embodiment, Servers <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>853</bold></highlight> store and serve different sets of content items. In such an embodiment, SPA <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> transmits, to a database in Smart Switch <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> or other location accessible to Smart Switch <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight>, the set of content items stored by each of Servers <highlight><bold>833</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>853</bold></highlight>. If, for example, a user access request specifies a content item not stored or otherwise unavailable at the time of the request from Server <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight>, then Smart Switch <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> would exclude Server <highlight><bold>843</bold></highlight> from the servers available to respond to the request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention or of the claims. It is also intended that the present invention and the appended claims cover modifications, variations and equivalents of the method and system of the present invention. </paragraph>
