<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention taught in this patent application is closely related to the invention taught in the following co-pending U.S. Provisional Patten Application Serial No. 60/274,162 and was filed on Mar. 08, 2001. All the teachings therein are incorporated into this application by reference thereto.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus for protecting clothing in a storage area from moths and other insects and, more particularly, the present invention pertains to a perforated or mesh bag containing specially cut aromatic red cedar to provide a specific aroma which may be renewed by periodic squeezing of the enclosing member. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Historically, American Red Cedar has been used in many forms by Native Americans and early settlers for years to protect clothing from moths and other insects. All the conventional cedar products have to be scratched or sanded to renew the cedar aroma when the aroma appears to have faded. There has been a need for a more simpler method of renewing the aroma of the cedar to ensure continued protection. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the present invention provides an apparatus for providing a renewable source of cedar aroma in a storage area. The apparatus consists of a plurality of thin cedar curls having a predetermined shape and having a predetermined surface area. The apparatus further includes a perforated bag for containing such plurality of thin cedar curls. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an apparatus which can introduce a large cedar aroma producing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus which has a perforated bag which can be hung in a storage area for containing such cedar aroma producing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Yet, another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus which can introduce a large cedar aroma producing surface in which the bag need only be squeezed to renew the cedar aroma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These and various other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent after a full reading of the following detailed description, particularly, when read in conjunction with the attached drawings as described below and the appended claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED AND VARIOUS ALTERNATE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Illustrated therein is a thin cedar curl, generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, typical of the geometry of the members which are stuffed into a mesh bag, generally designated <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The bag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is referred to in this application as a mesh bag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, the bag may not necessarily be specifically a mesh bag but is important that the bag be perforated so as to permit the cedar aroma to permeate into the storage area. In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention such bag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a mesh bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The mesh bag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be sized so as to provide a receptacle to enclose the required &ldquo;cedar aroma producing area&rdquo; for the storage area. This would mean that a small storage area could be protected with a relatively small bag which would contain only about 8 square feet of cedar producing exposed wood. While a larger bag containing up to about 175 square feet of exposed wood could be provided for a larger storage area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an inexpensive, quick and convenient method of introducing a large cedar aroma producing surface in a relatively small perforated or mesh bag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which can be hung in a storage area (not shown). The unique geometry of the thin cedar curls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a spiral like curl stuffing which is easily squeezed so as to provide fresh cedar aroma and then returns to its original bulk to be squeezed again when there is a need for fresh aroma. The presently preferred spiral shape of the cedar coils <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is easily seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When the bag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is hung in a storage area the bag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is squeezed to generate the cedar aroma. As the aroma fades after a period of time the bag <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> containing the cedar curls <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is squeezed again to renew the aroma. This process can be repeated again and again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While both the presently preferred and a number of alternative embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above it should be understood that various other adaptations and modifications of the present invention can be envisioned by those persons who are skilled in the relevant art without departing from either the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
