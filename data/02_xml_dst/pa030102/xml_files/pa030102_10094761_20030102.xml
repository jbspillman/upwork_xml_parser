<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The dielectric constant and tangent of a transmission structure is lowered by sandwiching a conductor between two dielectric structures one or both of which have a series of openings. The conductor is formed so that the conductor is formed across each opening of each dielectric structure. The dielectric structures provide structural support while exposing a significant portion of the conductor to air, thereby forming a transmission structure with an largely air-dielectric. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a transmission structure and, more particularly, to a transmission structure with an air dielectric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the field of electronics, one of the critical issues is the loss of signal strength as it is transmitted from device to device or system to system. In early circuit designs, this was not so great a concern because the signal speeds were relatively slow and were transmitted directly through copper or other metal conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As a result, the dielectric constant and loss tangent of the substrate and coating materials were not critical. The dielectric constant (permittivity) is the amount of electrical energy stored in an insulator when an electrical field is imposed across it. The dielectric constant is expressed in terms of a ratio to that in a vacuum. A lower dielectric constant (Dk) allows faster conductor signal speed as well as thinner interconnects for the same conductor geometries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The loss tangent (dissipation factor) is the degree of dielectric loss, and is expressed in terms of a ratio of the real-number and imaginary-number portion of a complex dielectric constant. A lower dissipation factor (Df) allows for improved signal integrity with high frequencies and less signal loss at high frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, at higher frequencies, the dielectric constant and loss tangent of the substrate and coating materials used in combination with the conductors are critical. The higher frequency signals propagate along the surface of the metal conductor, and are therefore impeded and degraded by the electrical properties (i.e. dielectric constant and loss tangent) of the dielectric materials that are adjacent to the conductor. There are also concerns about parasitic loss of signal due to build-up of capacitance in the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a result, many attempts have been made to produce electronic materials and structures that are capable of serving the needs of high-speed signal transmission both in substrates and in interconnection cables with minimum signal distortion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The conductor&apos;s attenuation is determined by dielectric losses and by frequency-dependent AC losses (skin effect in copper conductors). At high speeds, the skin effect contributes decisively to the overall loss and leads to a reduction in signal amplitude. The skin-effect can be counteracted by increased track width and thicker copper lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One way to mitigate the problem is to define, create and/or use materials having ever better dielectric/electrical properties such as lower dielectric constant (Dk) and loss tangent. Among the best materials yet discovered for this purpose are materials found in the family of fluropolymers such as E. I. Du Pont&apos;s Teflon&reg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These materials have dielectric constants in the range of 2.0-2.8. Other materials such as polypropylene have even lower dielectric constants, however, they have other properties such as strength and temperature limitations that make them less desirable for electronics manufacture. Table 1 provides a list of some of the materials that have been used alone or in combination in the manufacture of electronic circuits.

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the realm of high-speed transmission line cables, coaxial cables have seen the greatest use. However, as computer processing speeds have increased, there is now a need for next generation cables which can handle the increased data transmission requirements of shorter rise times while maintaining low noise and crosstalk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Typically, to protect signal integrity and to control signal line impedance, signal transmission cables are commonly provided with a conductive shield of metal foils, braided wire or the like. This also serves to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI) from radiating into and out from the cable. Pleated foil cables are an example of a shielded cable and represent one attempt to approximate the performance of conventional high-speed coaxial cables while allowing mass termination of the signals though use of specially developed connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Electronic conductor assemblies such as ribbon cable, coaxial cables and printed circuit boards have been insulated using a wide variety of different materials over time. Those having low dielectric constants and attenuation properties have proven most attractive for high speed signal processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Examples of such materials include polytetrafluoroethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene and fluoroethylpropylene. Values for these materials can be seen in Table 1. Originally these materials were used in solid form. However, as can be seen in Table 1, the best value is that of air, which is 1.0. (A vacuum is theoretically best but in practice is only marginally better than air.) Thus to improve the performance of some of these materials, air began to be included in the dielectric by foaming them with air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods have been used to foam insulating materials with air. These are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,680,423 and 5,110,998. Although this helps to lower the effective dielectric constant of the material, the surfaces remain largely intact, and thus loss at the surface is not greatly improved. U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,317 also describes a round conductor wrapped in perforated polyimide tape to lower the effective dielectric constant of the material without resorting to more exotic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An early approach to taking advantage of the dielectric properties of air is to spirally wrap a conductor wire with one or more strands of polymer, effectively holding them uniformly away from a circumferential ground reference. This is most suitable for round wire and cable constructions such as coaxial cables. While contact between the polymer strands and the conductor is greatly minimized, (reducing skin effect loss), the number of conductors that can be effectively handled is minimal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,953,566 and 4,730,088 disclose the use of polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) as a dielectric. However, the material is expensive and difficult to process in comparison to more commonly used dielectric materials. It remains attractive for it performance capability but it also has limits in high performance applications. To improve on the performance of the material, U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,088 describes how holes can be drilled into such materials by use of heat rays, particle rays or laser drilling. In addition, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,443,657 and 4,701,576 describe the use of sintering. In each case, however, the suggested methods only add processing costs to the expense of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene material can be created by methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,953,566, 3,962,153, 4,096,227, 4,187,390, and 4,902,423. Such material may also serve as improved low dielectric constant materials suitable for electronics applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Still other attempts have been made to create materials that provide still lower dielectric constants and loss tangents. U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,924, for example, describes a cable construction utilizing an insulator consisting of a cellular construction of porous polypropylene. The porous dielectric as manufactured has an air equivalent volume in excess of 70% and a dielectric constant of less than 1.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> This translates to a material that has a signal propagation velocity of the insulated conductor of approximately 85% of the propagation velocity in air. Although these dielectric materials exhibit excellent electrical properties when used as cable dielectrics, the process used in their manufacture is complex and they are thus expensive to produce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The pursuit of low loss, low dielectric constant materials is unending and continues to the present time. U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,756 describes a high-speed signal transmission cable with spaced, parallel conductors having an insulation layer comprised of a blown microfiber web surrounding the conductors to lower the dielectric constant of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While all of the efforts to date have made improvements in the state of the art, there has remained room for improvement. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E, air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a dielectric support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that has a series of spaced-apart openings OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-OPm, and a series of conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn that contact dielectric support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn are arranged in parallel (when more than one conductor is present), and contact dielectric support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> such that each conductor CD is formed over each opening OP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E, the length of an opening OP is a function of the number of conductors CD to be used, with length increasing with the number of conductors CD. The width of the opening OP is as wide as possible, limited by the need to maintain the structural integrity of the conductors CD without gravity induced deformation or sag, and the tensile strength and other requirements of transmission structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. (The width of the opening can alternately be shorter than the widest possible width.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As further shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E, air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes a dielectric support <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that has a series of spaced-apart openings ON<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-ONr. Dielectric support <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also contacts conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn such that each conductor CD is formed over each opening ON. As a result, conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn are sandwiched between dielectric supports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. To reduce capacitive losses, conductors can be narrowed as they cross over dielectric supports In one embodiment, dielectric supports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are identical, and contact conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn such that openings OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-OPm and ON<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-ONm are substantially in register with each other. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, openings OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-OPm and ON<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-ONr are vertically aligned with each other. In a second embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>E, openings OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-OPm and ON<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-ONm in dielectric supports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, respectively, are vertically offset from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition, air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a first shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is connected to dielectric support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a second shield <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that is connected to dielectric support <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Shields <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are both spaced apart from conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn by the thicknesses of dielectric supports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and provide a ground reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>E, external connections to conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn are made by forming dielectric supports <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to have contact openings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, respectively, that are vertically aligned with each other when contacting conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn, regardless of the alignment of openings OP and ON. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Further, shields <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are formed to have contact openings <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, respectively, which have vertical centerlines that are vertically aligned with the vertical centerlines of contact openings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In addition, air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a number of connector plugs CP (e.g., plated through holes) that are formed in contact openings <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Connector plugs CP make electrical connections with conductors CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDn, and are spaced apart from shields <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> via dielectric openings DI (which prevent shorting to ground and can be filled with a dielectric material). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can additionally include a plastic jacket (not shown) that is formed around shields <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to protect shields <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> from corrosive or other environmental effects and physical damage. Other materials can be added between shields <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the plastic jacket to provide structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will a particular cross-sectional shape, such as circular if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>I show a series of views that illustrate a method of forming an air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D show perspective views that illustrate a first part of the method of forming structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>E-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>I show cross-sectional views that illustrate a second part of the method of forming structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the method utilizes a dielectric support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that has a series of spaced-apart openings OP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-OPm, a conductive shield <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and a layer of conductive material <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>H, the length of an opening OP is a function of the number of to-be-formed conductors, with length increasing with the number of conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The width of the opening OP is as wide as possible, limited by the need to maintain the structural integrity of the to-be-formed conductors without gravity induced deformation or sag, and the tensile strength and other requirements of transmission structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. (The width of the opening can alternately be shorter than the widest possible width.) Dielectric support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is formed using conventional processes and materials. For example, a polymer film in a roll or sheet can be perforated to form openings OP. Although materials with a low dielectric constant are preferred electrically, the influence of support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is relatively small. As a result, higher dielectric materials can also be used to form dielectric support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the method begins by laminating together dielectric support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, conductive shield <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which can be implemented with, for example, a sheet of copper foil, and conductive layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> such that dielectric support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between shield <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and conductive layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Following this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> conductor mask <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is formed and patterned on conductor layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, conductive layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is etched away to form a series of conductors CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CCr, such as CD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CDr, on dielectric support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. After the etch, mask <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, once mask <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> has been removed, a dielectric support <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and a shield <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are laminated together and to conductors CC<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-CCr. Dielectric support <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and shield <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are conventionally prepared in a manner like dielectric support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and shield <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, once laminated together, conductors CC are spaced apart from shields <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> by the thicknesses of dielectric supports <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, respectively. (The air pressure in openings OP can be at any pressure provided it does not distort the structure and alter the electronic performance.) Following this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>F, openings <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are formed through shield <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, dielectric support <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, conductors CC, dielectric support <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and shield <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Openings <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> can be formed in any of a number of conventional ways, including masking and etching, micro-machining, and drilling. (Alternately, openings <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> can only extend down to and expose conductors CC.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G, a</cross-reference> layer of masking material is formed and patterned on shields <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to form a mask layer <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> that exposes openings <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. Openings <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are then plated (or filled) using conventional techniques to form conductive plugs (e.g., plated through holes) <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>. After conductive plugs <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> have been formed, mask layer <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Following this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H, a</cross-reference> layer of masking material is formed and patterned on shields <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> to form a mask layer <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> that protects plugs <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, and exposes a region of shield <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and a region of shield <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> around plugs <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>. Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>I, the exposed regions of shields <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are removed to thereby electrically isolate plugs <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> from shields <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> with a gap <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight>. Following this, mask layer <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> For larger cabling applications, there is no need to mask and etch a layer of conductive material to form conductors CC. In this case, metal wires are sandwiched between dielectric supports <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> using lamination or other conventional processes for forming a multi-layer structure. The metal wires can be, for example, flat or round. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D show cross-sectional views that illustrate alternate embodiments of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view that illustrates an air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. Structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is similar to structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and, as a result, utilizes the same reference numerals to designate the elements that are common to both structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> differs from structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in that structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> utilizes a solid dielectric layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in lieu of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, air is used as a dielectric on only one side of the structure. Such structures are suitable for mid-range frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view that illustrates an air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. Structure <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is similar to structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and, as a result, utilizes the same reference numerals to designate the elements that are common to both structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, structure <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> differs from structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in that structure <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> has a connector opening <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> formed through dielectric layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to expose the conductors CD, but no corresponding opening formed through dielectric layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As shown, the width of the opening through shield <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be wider than the width of the opening through dielectric layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view that illustrates an air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. Structure <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is similar to structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and, as a result, utilizes the same reference numerals to designate the elements that are common to both structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, structure <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> differs from structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in that structure <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> has a third dielectric structure <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> connected to first shield <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and spaced-apart conductors CS that are connected to third dielectric structure <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. In addition, structure <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> also has a fourth dielectric structure <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> connected to conductors CS, and a third shield <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> connected to fourth dielectric structure <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. Dielectric structures <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> are similar to dielectric structures <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and conductors CS are similar to conductors CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Thus, structure <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> provides an example of multiple layers of conductors (more than two layers of conductors can also be used). Further, a first connector opening <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> to conductors CS can be formed through dielectric structures <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, or can be formed through shield <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> and dielectric structure <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. Structure <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> also has a second connector opening <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> formed through dielectric layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to expose the conductors CD. (In both cases, the widths of the openings <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> through the metal shield can be wider than the width of the opening through the dielectric structure.) <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view that illustrates an air dielectric transmission structure <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. Structure <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is similar to structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and, as a result, utilizes the same reference numerals to designate the elements that are common to both structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>D, structure <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> differs from structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in that structure <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> has stair-step ends <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>D, the end section of dielectric support <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and shield <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> have been removed to expose a section of conductors CD. In addition, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D, a</cross-reference> smaller end section of conductors CD can also be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In addition to transmission structures <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, the present invention can also be utilized to form high speed back planes. FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E show perspective views that illustrate a back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows a perspective view of a back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows a close-up view of a portion of back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows a perspective view that illustrates back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference> shows a perspective view that illustrates an alternate embodiment of back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional perspective view that illustrates the alternate embodiment of back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a dielectric support <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that has a number of openings <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> which are arranged in rows and columns. In addition, back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> also includes a number of conductors <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> that are formed on dielectric support <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> such that each conductor <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is formed over each opening <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> in a row of openings. In the example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, two conductors <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> are formed over each opening <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> in a row of openings (except for the first and last rows of openings <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> along the edge). In addition, each conductor <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> includes a number of contact regions <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> which are formed so that a contact region <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> is formed at each end of each opening <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the example shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C, the width of an opening <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is a function of the size of contact regions <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. The length of opening <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is as long as possible, limited by the need to maintain the structural integrity of the conductors <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> without gravity induced deformation or sag, and the tensile strength and other requirements of back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. (The length of opening <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> can alternately be shorter than the longest possible length.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> also includes a layer of insulation material <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> that is formed on conductors <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, and a first metal shield <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> formed on insulation material <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, insulation material <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> can have openings <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> such that insulation material <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> only occasionally contacts conductors <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, or openings such that insulation material <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> does not contact conductors <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 4E</cross-reference>, insulation material <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is formed as a solid element with no openings, other than for conductive plugs <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</cross-reference>. Conductive plugs <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> are similar to plugs CP. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 4E</cross-reference> also show a second metal shield <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> that contacts dielectric support <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> (the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> also has a second metal shield). In addition, back plane <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can be utilized alone, or can be incorporated into a larger back plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a plan view that illustrates a curved section of an air dielectric transmission system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention.
