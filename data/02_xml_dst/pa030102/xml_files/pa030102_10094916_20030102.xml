<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to integrated circuits, and more particularly, to an input buffer capable of tolerating high input voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, an input buffer responds to a signal having a predetermined voltage level, e.g., a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) signal, converts the signal into a signal having a predetermined different voltage level, e.g., a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) signal, and supplies the converted signal to an internal circuit of an integrated circuit (IC). An input buffer is connected to an input pad of an IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A signal externally applied to the input pad of an IC may not be a signal that is appropriate for normal operation of the IC. In a case where an external device electrically connected to an input pad of an IC having a voltage higher than a supply voltage used in the IC, the input buffer must also operate with a voltage higher than the supply voltage used in the IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In a case where a supply voltage of 5V, 3.3V, 2.5V and 1.8V is supplied to an IC, a buffer which is driven by an input signal having a voltage higher than the supply voltage of the IC is referred to as a tolerant input buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In general, in a case where a supply voltage of 3.3V, or 2.5V is used, the highest tolerable input signal is 5V. In a case where a supply voltage of 1.8V is used, a highest tolerable input signal is 3.3V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a conventional tolerant input buffer circuit. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the tolerant input buffer includes a pad <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a path transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a Schmitt trigger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and an inverter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. An input signal IN is input to the pad <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the resistor R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> restricts current flowing to the drain of the path transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The pass transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is implemented by a NMOS transistor and transmits a signal smaller than a supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for the input signal IN greater than the supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (e.g., 3.3V) applied to the gate to a node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. That is, in a case where the input signal IN is greater than the supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the path transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits a signal whose voltage is lowered to a threshold voltage (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;Vth&rsquo;) of the NMOS transistor from the supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, to the node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The path transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may cut off at a voltage lower than an input logic high voltage (VIH) of the Schmitt trigger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> due to the threshold voltage Vth increased by a body effect. As a result, when designing a VIH, in the worst case, the node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes a floating node, and thus, the input buffer is driven by a voltage generated by leakage current in a sub-threshold region, and the VIH is indicated as a higher value, thereby affecting sizing of the input buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> For example, if the input signal IN is linearly increased from 0V to 3.3V at the pad <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, an ideal tolerant input buffer of 5V must transmit the signal of 0V&tilde;3.3V to the node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the conventional tolerant input buffer is cut off by the threshold voltage of the path transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at the point of 2.2V, and thus, a DC/AC voltage Vn<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> gradually increases from the point of 2.2V and loses its linearity. This problem occurs in an analog tolerant input circuit such as a comparator and an amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, since the path transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is cut off before the VIH of the Schmitt trigger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the input voltage of the Schmitt trigger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is increased by leakage current of the path transistor T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> until reaching a transition voltage of the Schmitt trigger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and thus, it takes a long time to reach the transition voltage of the Schmitt trigger <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As a result, propagation delay increases. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a tolerant input buffer circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the tolerant input buffer is one of signal transmission circuits implemented in a semiconductor integrated circuit and includes a first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a first inverting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and a second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The tolerant input buffer may further include an electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a second inverting circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The ESD protection circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> protects an internal circuit of a semiconductor memory device from ESD applied from outside of the semiconductor memory device and is installed in a pad of a chip in order to prevent discharge from an external pin from applied ESD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When ESD is applied to an input pin <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the ESD protection circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> causes a punch-through phenomenon, thereby sending high current caused by ESD to the ground voltage Vss and protecting the internal circuit of the memory device. That is, in a case where a very high voltage is induced to the drains of MOS transistors T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and T<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, punch-through occurs in the MOS transistors T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, or T<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The ESD protection circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of transistors T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through T<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The source of the transistor T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to a first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (e.g., 3.3V), and the gate thereof is connected to a node A. The gate of the transistor T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is connected to the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the drain thereof is connected to the node A, and the source and substrate thereof are connected to the drain and substrate of the transistor T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The source of the transistor T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the substrate and gate thereof are connected to the source and substrate of the transistor T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the substrate of the transistor T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the substrate of the transistor T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the drain thereof is connected to the node A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The gate of the transistor T<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the drain thereof is connected to the node A, and the substrate thereof is connected to the ground voltage Vss. The gate, source, and substrate of the transistor T<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are connected to the ground voltage Vss, and the drain thereof is connected to the source of the transistor T<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A resistor R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected between the node A and a node B, transmits an input signal IN input to a pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from the node A to the node B and restricts current flowing from the node A to the node B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Preferably, in a case where the supply voltage of the semiconductor memory device is 3.3V or 2.5V, the tolerant input buffer tolerates the input signal IN from 0V to 5V. Preferably, in a case where the supply voltage of the semiconductor memory device is 1.8V, the tolerant input buffer tolerates an input signal IN from 0V to 3.3V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits a signal of the node B to a node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is an NMOS transistor. The gate of the NMOS transistor is connected to the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the drain thereof is connected to the node B, and the source thereof is connected to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a predetermined substrate voltage (e.g., negative voltage) is supplied to the substrate thereof. The first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be 3.3V, 2.5V, or 1.8V, but in the illustrative embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is 3.3V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> That is, in a case where the voltage of the node B is greater than 3.3V, the maximum voltage transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponds to a voltage drop from the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of 3.3V to a threshold voltage (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;Vth&rsquo;) of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For example, assuming that 3.3V is supplied to the gate of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the threshold voltage Vth of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 0.7V, the maximum voltage transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is 2.6V. However, considering a body effect of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the maximum voltage transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be smaller than 2.6V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits the signal of the node B to the <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a PMOS transistor. The gate of the PMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is connected to a node D, and the source thereof is connected to the node B, and the drain thereof is connected to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a predetermined substrate voltage (e.g., positive voltage) is supplied to the substrate thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits the signal of the node B to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in response to the amplitude of the signal of the node B and the amplitude of the signal of the node D. That is, the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on and transmits the signal of the node B to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> only if the signal of the node B is greater in amplitude than the signal of the node D and greater than the threshold voltage Vth of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The first inverting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> inverts the signal of the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and outputs the inverted signal to a node C. A Schmitt trigger is used as the first inverting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> pulls down the node D in a case where the signal of the node C is logic &lsquo;high&rsquo;. The first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes NMOS transistors T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The gate of the NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is connected to the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the drain thereof is connected to the node D, and the substrate thereof is connected to the ground voltage Vss. The gate of the NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected to the node C, and the source and substrate thereof are connected to the ground voltage Vss, and the drain thereof is connected to the source of the NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> However, the first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may include only the transistor T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the drain thereof being connected to the node D, the gate thereof being connected to the node C, and the source and substrate thereof being connected to the ground voltage Vss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> transmits the signal of the node B to the node D. The second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a PMOS transistor. The gate of the PMOS transistor is connected to a second supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the source thereof is connected to the node B, and the drain thereof is connected to the node D. Here, in this illustrative embodiment, the second supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 2.5V. However, the second supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be a voltage other than 2.5V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is greater than the second supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The second inverting circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> inverts the signal of the node C and outputs an output signal OUT to a predetermined internal circuit (not shown). </paragraph>

Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the tolerant input buffer, as one of signal transmission circuits, includes a first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a first inverting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and a transition voltage control circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The tolerant input buffer may further include an electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a second inverting circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having the same structure as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The basic operation of the tolerant input buffer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is similar to the tolerant input buffer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The transition voltage control circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is connected between the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The transition voltage control circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may include a voltage comparator. According to the state of the signal of the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, logic &lsquo;high&rsquo; is transitioned to logic &lsquo;low&rsquo;, or logic &lsquo;low&rsquo; is transitioned to logic &lsquo;high&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> That is, the transition voltage control circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may control an input logic low voltage (VIL) or an input logic high voltage (VIH) of the first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. For example, the transition voltage control circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> recognizes the case where the signal of the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is 3V, as the VIH, thereby turning on the NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Further, the transition voltage control circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> recognized a case where the signal of the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is 2V, as the VIH, thereby turning on the NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> supplies a predetermined signal to the gate of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, thereby controlling the operation of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. That is, the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> transmits the signal of the node B to the node D in response to the output signal of the voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> supplied to the gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> For example, assuming that the output signal of the voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is 2.5V, and the threshold voltage Vth of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is 0.8V, the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on and transmits the signal of the node B to the node D in a case where a signal greater than 3.3V is input to the node B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Further, assuming that the output signal of the voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is 1.8V and the threshold voltage Vth of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is 0.8V, the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on and transmits the signal of the node B to the node D in a case where a signal greater than 2.6V is input to the node B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In a case where the output signal of the voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> increases, the amplitude of the signal of the node B turning on the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> increases. However, in a case where the output signal of the voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> decreases, the amplitude of the signal of the node B turning on the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Since switching of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is controlled by the output signal of the voltage generation circuit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, switching of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be controlled. Thus, a signal transmitted from the node B to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be controlled by switching of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the comparison of DC voltage characteristics of the conventional tolerant input buffer circuit with the tolerant input buffer circuit according to the embodiments of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, IN denotes a signal input to a pad <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, Vn<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a DC voltage of a node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and Vn<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes a DC voltage of the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the conventional tolerant input buffer, in a case where the voltage of the input signal IN is linearly increased to 2.2V, the voltage transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is linearly increased. However, in a case where the voltage of the input signal IN is greater than 2.2V, the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 &amp; 3</cross-reference>) is cut off, and the voltage transmitted to the node n <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not linearly increased, and is gradually increased according to the leakage current of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> However, in the tolerant input buffer according to the embodiments of the present invention, even if the input signal IN is increased to 3.7V, the voltage transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is linearly increased. In a case where the input signal IN is greater than 3.7V, the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is cut off and is gradually increased by leakage current of the first and second transmission circuits T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a comparison of AC voltage characteristics of the conventional tolerant input buffer circuit with the tolerant input buffer circuit according to the embodiments of the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, IN denotes a signal input to a pad <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, Vn<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes an AC voltage of a node n<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and Vn<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> denotes an AC voltage of the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In a case where the input signal IN of the tolerant input buffer according to the present invention is increased from 0V to 4V, the voltage of the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is linearly increased to 4V and is maintained at 4V. Vn<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is higher than Vn<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> because of capacitance of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, in a case where the first supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is 3.3V, and the second supply voltage Vdd<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 2.5V, if the input signal IN of 0V is input to the input pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on and transmits the signal of the node B of 0V to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The Schmitt trigger <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> inverts the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and outputs &lsquo;high&rsquo; to the node C. The NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is turned on in response to the &lsquo;high&rsquo; level at node C, and thus, the node D is pulled down to the ground voltage Vss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Since the voltage of 0V is applied to the gate of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the state where 0V is input to the node B, the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned off. In such a case, the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, if the input signal IN increased to 1V is input to the input pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the signal of 1V to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first inverting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is not transitioned to &lsquo;high&rsquo; in response to the signal transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and thus, the output of the node C is maintained at &lsquo;high&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is turned on and pulls down the node D, and thus, 0V is applied to the gate of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, if a voltage higher than the threshold voltage Vth of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is input to the node B, that is, to the source of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and 0V is applied to the gate of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on and transmits the input signal IN of 1V to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on, but the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Further, if the input signal IN, which is increased, e.g., to 2.2V, is input to the input pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the threshold voltage Vth of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is increased due to a body effect of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and thus, the threshold voltage Vth of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is increased to a level greater than the voltage of the gate and source of the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> However, the first inverting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is not transitioned from &lsquo;high&rsquo; to &lsquo;low&rsquo; and still outputs &lsquo;high&rsquo; to the node C. Thus, the node D is pulled down to the ground voltage Vss, and the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> That is, the input signal IN input to the source of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is 2.2V, and a signal input to the gate of the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is 0V, and thus, the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned on and transmits the signal of the node B to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Thus, the input signal IN of 2.2V is transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In such a case, the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If the input signal IN (e.g., greater than 2.2V) is input to the input pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the inverting circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> outputs &lsquo;low&rsquo; to the node C in response to the signal of the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> greater than the VIH. Thus, the NMOS transistor T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the first switching circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is turned off, and the node D is floated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> At this time, the voltage of the node D increases, but the voltage of the node D is maintained at a predetermined voltage (e.g., about 1V) due to leakage current of the NMOS transistors T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Thus, the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is still turned on and transmits the signal of the node B to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is still turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In a case where the input signal IN of 3.6V is input to the input pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a signal corresponding to the input signal IN is input to the node B, considering a body effect of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the signal transmitted to the source (node B) of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is greater than the sum of the signal supplied to the gate of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the threshold voltage Vth of the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and thus, the second switching circuit T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the signal of the node B is transmitted to the node D, and thus, the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Further, if the input signal IN greater than 3.6V is input to the input pad <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the first and second transmission circuits T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are turned off. The tolerant input buffer is stable even if the input signal IN greater than a tolerant voltage is transmitted to the node B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> For example, the input signal IN from 0V to 1V is transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the first transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the input signal IN from 1V to 2.2V is transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the first and second transmission circuits T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the input signal IN from 2.2V to 3.6V is transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through the second transmission circuit T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The input signal IN greater than 3.6V is not transmitted to the node n<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> because the first and second transmission circuits T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are cut off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The numerical values are used only to illustrate the operation of the signal transmission circuit, for example, the tolerant input buffer according to the embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the tolerant input buffer according to the present invention shows voltage linearity even for an input signal greater than the conventional tolerant input buffer, thereby facilitating design of circuits with stable DC voltage and improved delay characteristics. Further, since voltage linearity is improved, the voltage linearity may be effectively used in an analog tolerant input buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
