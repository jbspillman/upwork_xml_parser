<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to periodicals. More specifically, the invention relates to a method and system for managing information presented in periodicals by creating personalized indexes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The sheer volume of information provided in magazines often overwhelms a reader&apos;s ability to process it. It is typical for a single magazine to include over one hundred articles, with a dozen or more directed to a single topic. Printed indices and tables of contents may themselves run for many pages. If a reader desires to receive current information, for example, on a particular person or company, he may find a dozen references to that company or person indexed within a single magazine. Often the reader must dedicate valuable time evaluating all of the content in order to determine which of it satisfies his particular interests. A typical index only provides the page numbers where the name or company is mentioned, and typically does not describe what the article relates to or the content in which a name or company is mentioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Abstract services are available which produce abstracts of magazine articles covering specific areas of interest to information consumers. These abstracts are distributed in accordance with reader profiles and are used to identify articles of likely interest to the consumer. Upon request, the reader may obtain full copies of the articles. Such services suffer, however, from the obvious drawback that access to the full article requires a separate time-consuming action and a positive effort on the part of the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> At least one magazine, <highlight><italic>American Baby</italic></highlight>, attempts to include custom editorial matter. Profile data is collected from subscribers for the purpose of providing targeted content to individual subscribers. If, for example, a subscriber is identified as having a three-months old infant, then an article relevant to such an infant may be specially inserted into that subscriber&apos;s magazine along with the standard content. The inclusion of that insert is noted on the cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Such a process suffers from the significant shortcoming of not making it any easier to find other relevant articles in the magazine. The magazine still contains hundreds of pages of standard-content information that, as described above, contributes to the information overload of the reader.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Introduction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, one or more hyper-footnotes may be included in a customized index. Alternatively, or in addition, one or more references to a hyper-footnote (e.g., &ldquo;See the hyper-footnote at page 6, paragraph 2.&rdquo;) may be included in a customized index. These embodiments thus allow a subscriber of a periodical to quickly identify whether any supplemental information associated with the standard printed content of a periodical is of interest to the subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;hyper-footnote&rdquo; means a code or other indicator identifying a limited portion of information in standard printed content of a periodical for which supplemental information exists. The code, or a reference to the code, may be printed or embedded in the midst of an article or as described more fully herein below it may be otherwise discernable or calculable by a reader, and, alternatively or in addition, may be included in an index customized for a subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Hyper-footnotes allow information gatherers such as newspapers a means of providing information that would otherwise be wasted. They can now provide subscribers magazines, newspapers, or similar printed media with the capability to obtain supplemental information on selected segments of information contained in the articles. Readers may obtain the supplemental information directly from publishers that print the articles, operators of electronic databases containing the supplemental information, or third party intermediaries handling requests for supplemental information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Hyper-footnotes may be embedded by a publisher in the midst of at least one printed article as a code that is physically positioned to identify a limited portion of information in the printed article. Hyper-footnotes may also be included in a customized index for a subscriber in such a way as to identify supplemental information related to a limited portion of information in a printed article that may be of interest to the reader. A reader may use the code to indicate further interest in supplemental information located in an electronic database, and to select a method of delivery whereby the supplemental information in the database can be delivered the reader. For example, using the code may permit the reader to access a remote electronic database containing supplemental information related to the limited portion of information in the article, utilize the code to indicate further interest in the supplemental information, and select a method of delivering the supplemental information in the database to the reader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accordance with other various embodiments of the present invention, a subscriber of a periodical is able to quickly identify whether an issue of the periodical contains standard printed content of interest to the subscriber and what that standard printed content is. The subscriber provides a list of personal preferences indicative of standard printed content that the subscriber is interested in reading. The publisher of the periodical compares the personal preferences with content information for a particular issue of the periodical to determine whether the issue contains standard printed content matching the subscriber&apos;s personal preferences. The publisher then creates a customized index, which a fulfillment house attaches to the periodical mailed to the particular subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Various preferred embodiments of the invention involve attaching to a periodical an &ldquo;outer wrap,&rdquo; on which the customized index is printed. As used in this specification, the term &ldquo;outer wrap&rdquo; generally refers to any article, attachable to a periodical, on which an index may be printed. Examples of an &ldquo;outer wrap&rdquo; include, but are not limited to, a paper or cardboard wrapper in which the periodical is provided, an adhesive label, an envelope, a card, and a poly bag outer cover. In alternative embodiments, the customized index may be printed directly on the outside or inside of the periodical or printed on an insert, such as a bind-in card, affixed to the inside of the periodical. Further, it is to be understood that the index could be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail, phone (using an IVRU), or the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition, unless otherwise indicated, the term &ldquo;magazine&rdquo; is used in this specification interchangeably with &ldquo;periodical,&rdquo; which refers generally to any publication or work for which one or more issues are published or for which a subscription may be obtained in any medium, such as a magazine, newspaper, journal, CD-ROM, cassette tape, video tape, and computer-readable medium. Similarly, unless otherwise indicated, the term &ldquo;article&rdquo; is used in this specification to mean any content, material, or writings contained in a periodical, including articles, reports, summaries, stories, songs, films, clips, and computer programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;standard printed content&rdquo; refers to content contained in a periodical for general distribution and is distinguishable from specialized content, which is directed to a particular group of subscribers according to subscriber characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and distribution channel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is in communication with subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Distribution channel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives magazines from fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and delivers them to respective subscribers, such as subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> represents a person who desires to obtain a subscription to a periodical, such as a magazine. Subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> communicates with publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by transmitting, for example, personal preference information, which identifies standard printed content of interest. Personal preference information preferably identifies attributes indicative of articles of interest and may specify, for example, the article&apos;s general subject matter (e.g., sports, politics), specific subject matter defined by key words found in the articles (e.g., companies of interest, industries of interest, people of interest, geographic areas of interest), the name of the articles&apos; authors or creators, and the article type (e.g., editorial, product review). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> represents the publisher of a periodical for which subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> desires a subscription. In a preferred embodiment, publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a processor-based system having a central controller configured to receive personal preference information from subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and generate appropriate index information for transmission, along with content information, to fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, according to one embodiment of the invention. Central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes central processing unit (CPU) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, communications port <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and data storage device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, which may be standard hardware components. CPU <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is linked to each of the other elements and executes program modules stored in RAM <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and/or data storage device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to perform operations and functions associated with central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> described below. Central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may also include components to facilitate communication, such as a voice recognition unit (VRU) <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, VRU interface <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, and modem <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. Communication port <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> interfaces with VRU interface <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, which links to VRU <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and modem <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, which links to a public switched telephone network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Data storage device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> maintains several databases, including magazine database <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, preferences database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, issue database <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, a hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, and a supplemental information database <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. Sample fields associated with these databases are described below in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>G. In alternative embodiments, fewer or more fields may be included in these databases. Some of the fields described below are not needed to accomplish the invention, but are included to illustrate the types of data that may be used in conjunction with the invention. Likewise, in alternative embodiments, fewer or more databases may be used to store similar data in storage device <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Magazine database <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> generally contains data relating to magazines published by publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> illustrates a sample of the fields used in magazine database <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>. The fields shown include (1) magazine ID number, (2) magazine name, and (3) periods. Magazine ID number (field 1) represents a unique identifier corresponding to a particular magazine title and is generally used by central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to specify particular magazine titles. Associated with the magazine ID number are the magazine name (field 2) and time periods (field 3) in which the particular issue was, or will be, published. Other information may also be provided in magazine database <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> to permit access to additional information relating to the magazine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> generally contains data relating to articles, documents, or other segments of the standard printed content contained in different magazine issues. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> illustrates a sample of the fields in content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, which include (1) magazine ID number, (2) issue number, (3) number of articles, (4) article title, (5) content code, (6) author, and (7) page number. Each entry in database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, indexed by magazine ID number and issue number, contains data relating to the content of a particular magazine issue, such as the number of articles in the issue (field 3), the articles&apos; titles (field 4), the authors of the articles (field 6), and the articles&apos; page numbers (field 7). Each entry may also be associated with one or more content codes (field 5), representing attributes associated with the content of the articles in a particular magazine issue. The content codes are generated according to a coding scheme that associates each content code with a unique attribute. These attributes may include an article&apos;s general subject matter (e.g., sports, politics), specific subject matter defined by key words found in the articles (e.g., companies of interest, industries of interest, people of interest, geographic areas of interest), the name of the articles&apos; authors, and the article type (e.g., editorial, product review). For example, a content code may represent the specific subject matter of &ldquo;Dinosaurs&rdquo; and may be stored in correspondence with a particular issue of a magazine, such as a Time Magazine issue containing an article about dinosaurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Alternative or additional information may be included in content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. Content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> may include, for example, an identifier that identifies an article or other segment of standard printed content, such as article number (field 8), a unique alphanumeric used to identify an article. An article text field (field 9) may be used to store all (or a portion) of the text of an article. Accordingly, a type of intelligent search could be performed to identify content satisfying the subscriber&apos;s interests, as will be further discussed below. A hyper-footnote list (field 10) may be used to list one or more hyper-footnotes corresponding to supplemental information that is related to portions of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to various embodiments of the present invention, content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> contains data relating to different types of standard printed content of a periodical, such as, for example, articles, sports information, business information, classified information, real estate listings, comics, games and puzzles, letters, advertisements, information about advertisers, information about an author, information about a publisher, subscription information, and bibliographies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> contains data relating to subscribers of the magazines and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, may include several fields, including (1) subscriber number, (2) name, (3) magazine ID number, (4) index number, (5) subscription expiration date, (6) address, (7) phone number, and (8) credit card number. Subscriber numbers (field 1) allow publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to uniquely identify subscribers. The index number field (field 4) stores information indicating by number whether preferences database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> contains preference information for particular subscribers. The remaining information relates to subscriber information, such as address, phone number, and credit card number, and subscription information, such as the magazine to which the subscriber has subscribed and the date on which the subscription expires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> may also include fields (not shown) such as, for example, facsimile telephone number, e-mail address, credit card type and number, preferred delivery means, and account balance. The preferred delivery means is for the customer&apos;s selected method to receive requested supplemental information. Such methods may include, for example, regular mail, or a faster courier service such as Federal Express, DHL Courier, etc. Facsimile and e-mail are additional methods for delivering requested supplemental information. Another available delivery method is to send any requested supplemental information to an address on the World Wide Web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The account balance field may be used to bill the customer if the customer has requested, for example, invoice billing. Alternatively, the account balance may be used to bill the subscriber&apos;s credit card by sending a payment request to the appropriate credit card processing company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Preferences database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> contains data relating to attributes indicative of magazine articles that subscribers are interested in reading and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>D, is indexed by the index number (field 1). Each subscriber identified by subscriber number (field 2) may have one or more preferences (field 3), which identify desired attributes indicative of articles of interest. Preferences are preferably coded according to a coding scheme similar to the one used to code the content codes contained in content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, the preferences may appear in database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> as text describing the desired attributes. Subscriber content code (field 4) designates the code (or codes) corresponding to the preferences in field 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</cross-reference> illustrates sample fields for data found in issue database <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, which generally contains index information for respective subscribers. Database <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>E, includes the following fields: (1) magazine ID number, (2) issue number, (3) subscriber number, (4) index number, and (5) indexed articles. Indexed according to magazine ID number and issue number, entries in issue database <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> contain index information for corresponding subscribers. The index number identifies, by reference to preferences database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, information to be printed on the customized index for each subscriber, and may identify such information as article names, article numbers, hyper-footnotes, authors, article summaries, and corresponding page numbers associated with articles possessing the attributes to which the subscriber has indicated interest. The particular index information stored under field (4) may vary, however, according to the manner in which the customized index is to be constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> According to an alternative or additional embodiment, indexed articles (field 5) includes information to be printed on the customized index for each subscriber, and may identify such information as article names, article numbers, hyper-footnotes, authors, article summaries, and corresponding page numbers associated with articles possessing the attributes to which the subscriber has indicated interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The particular information stored in the indexed information field (field 5) may vary, however, according to the manner in which the customized index is to be constructed. For example, in an alternative embodiment, indexed articles (field 5) contains one or more identifiers that identify articles determined to be of interest to the subscriber. Each article identifier corresponds to an identifier stored in content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> (field 8), and thus may be used to retrieve information about the indexed article stored in content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> One or more hyper-footnotes (or references to hyper-footnotes) may be included in a customized index. A hyper-footnote may be a code embedded in the text of the printed article or a portion of the printed article itself. In the latter situation, the hyper-footnote may be represented in the article in a variety of different ways. When using a method other than embedded codes to indicate the existence of a hyper-footnote, it may also be necessary to provide further information in the printed article, for example, a number identifying the printed article as well as the line number corresponding to the portion constituting a hyper-footnote. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Different types of hyper-footnotes may be used to distinguish between different types of supplemental information such as textual, audio, or video information. Thus, by viewing the particular hyper-footnote, the reader may determine whether the available supplemental information is text, audio, video, or some other form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the present invention thus provide a practical and economically feasible system for publishers to indicate to readers the availability of valuable supplement information, which is often developed in the routine process of business but otherwise wasted, related to information found in print material. This is accomplished by providing readers with hyper-footnotes, or references to hyper-footnotes, a simple means to identify whether supplemental information exists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</cross-reference> depicts sample fields for information stored in hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. Hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> includes a listing of hyper-footnotes and corresponding supplemental information identifiers used to locate corresponding supplemental information in the supplemental information database <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. Hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> includes records preferably having four fields: hyper-footnote identifier (field 1), parent article number list (field 2), hyper-footnote location (field 3), and supplemental information number (field 4). Hyper-footnote identifier (field 1) is, for example, a unique alphanumeric used to identify each hyper-footnote. Hyper-footnote identifiers may be found in the hyper-footnote list for a corresponding article specified in the content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> (at field 10). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Parent article number list (field 2) preferably includes article numbers from content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> (at field 8) corresponding to each hyper-footnote in hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. One hyper-footnote may relate to one or more articles, and vice versa. Hyper-footnote list (field 10 of content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>) for each article of content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> relates the article to its one or more corresponding hyper-footnotes. Parent article number list (field 2 of hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>) for each hyper-footnote of hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> relates the hyper-footnote to its one or more corresponding articles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Hyper-footnote location (field 3) for each hyper-footnote indicates the location, such as page number and line number, of the hyper-footnotes within the text of an article of content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. Finally, supplemental information number (field 4) preferably is a unique identifier corresponding to each hyper-footnote of hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> and specifying an entry in supplemental information database <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Supplemental information database <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> stores the supplemental information corresponding to portions of information in printed articles. Supplemental information database <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>G, preferably includes three fields: supplemental information number (field 1), supplemental information (field 2), and length of the supplemental information (field 3). Supplemental information number (field 1) for each entry of supplemental information database <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> preferably is a unique alphanumeric identifier that identifies the supplemental information. The identifier (field 1) is used to locate supplemental information corresponding to hyper-footnotes in hyper-footnote database <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. Each supplemental information record of supplemental information database <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> preferably also includes supplemental information (field 2) as well as its length (field 3). In addition to text, the supplemental information field (field 2) may contain audio, video, or another form of supplemental information to the printed text of an article. The length (field 3) is used, for example, for output control and, if so configured, for determining the cost of providing the supplemental information in response to requests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A system and method for providing supplemental information in response to requests is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/422,719, filed on Oct. 22, 1999, incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> receives content and index information from publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and includes a bindery (not shown), which physically constructs magazines to which the customized indexes are attached. In a preferred embodiment, the bindery comprises a conventional facility for assembling magazines, which is controlled by a processor-based central controller <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in a manner that facilitates the operations and functions described below. One conventional bindery utilizes a bindery line, or assembly line, in which magazine issues are constructed in stages. At the final stage, the bindery is preferably capable of attaching a customized index to a magazine by, for example, attaching a poly bag outer wrap containing the index to the magazine or printing the index directly on the magazine, according to signals from central controller <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a preferred embodiment of central controller <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, central controller <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> preferably includes certain conventional components, such as CPU <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, RAM <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, communications port <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, and data storage device <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. CPU <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is coupled to the other elements and executes program code stored in RAM <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, and/or data storage device <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> to facilitate the functions and operations of central controller <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Communications port <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> facilitates electronic communication with central controller <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is coupled to publisher interface <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> and bindery interface <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, which connect to publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the bindery, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Data storage device <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> maintains several databases, including subscriber database <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> and issue database <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>. These databases preferably contain the same or similar data as stored in databases <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, respectively. CPU <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is capable of accessing the data stored in data storage device <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Distribution channel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> represents one or more conventional entities which provides delivery service (e.g., postal delivery, parcel delivery, courier) and that delivers magazines containing customized indexes received from fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to respective subscribers. Distribution channel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> preferably operates in a manner that facilitates conventional modes of magazine distribution, such as home or office delivery for subscribers or delivery to a retail outlet for subscriber pick-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Operation of the System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Consistent with the invention, various operations of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are now described in connection with the flowcharts illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> contains flowchart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> depicting a process in which a subscriber provides subscriber information and personal preferences to a publisher and the publisher enters the subscriber information. Publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> lists preferences on blow-in, bind-in, or subscription cards inserted in magazines (step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>). Such cards are conventionally used by subscribers to mail in magazine subscription orders and are inserted into magazines using known methods. In one embodiment, these cards contain space for subscribers to fill in subscriber information (e.g., subscriber name, address, subscription duration, and payment information) as well as a list of personal preferences relating to magazine article attributes from which subscribers may select. Subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, who receives one of the blow-in cards, checks off or lists the preferences in which he is interested (step <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> returns the completed blow-in card to publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by, for example, mailing the card (step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>). Publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives the mailed blow-in card with the subscriber&apos;s personal preferences (step <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>) and queries subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> to determine whether a subscriber record exists for subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>). If a subscriber record does not exist for subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>535</bold></highlight>), publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> creates a new record in subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> using the subscriber information provided on the received blow-in card (step <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>). This new record is created in a conventional manner by, for example, entering subscriber information into subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>. Publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also assigns a subscriber number to subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which is stored in subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s record as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Following step <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, or step <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> if a subscriber record already exists, publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> assigns an index number for the content preference information received on the blow-in card and stores an index number in the subscriber&apos;s record in subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>. (step <highlight><bold>545</bold></highlight>). Publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> creates a record in preferences database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> using the index number and subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s subscriber number stored in subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> and stores preferences contained on the received blow-in card (step <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>). In a preferred embodiment, the preferences are entered as preference codes according to a coding scheme in which the preference codes represent desired attributes of articles of interest. As previously mentioned with regards to the content of the magazine, the subscriber preferences could be stored as received in text format and not coded to allow for a different type of query to be performed. Of course, subscriber preferences could be stored according to a coding scheme as well as in text format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The above-described process for communicating subscriber preferences to publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> using blow-in or subscription cards constitutes one implementation of the invention. In alternative implementations, the subscriber preferences may be communicated using other conventional communication devices, such as the telephone (via VRU or live operator), facsimile, electronic mail and the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows flowchart <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> representing a process in which publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> receives and processes the content information of a magazine. An author submits his article to publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>), which reviews the content of the article and assigns appropriate content codes to the article (step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>). The content codes may be assigned according to an appropriate coding scheme, preferably compatible with the coding scheme employed for the preference codes. These content codes are generally assigned to reflect the content of the article. Publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> enters article information into content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>). Examples of article information include the magazine ID number of the magazine in which the article will appear, the article title, any corresponding hyper-footnote(s), appropriate content code(s), the author, and the page number at which the article will appear in the magazine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may also assign an article identifier to the article and store the identifier in content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>&apos;s central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> queries subscriber database <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> to determine the index numbers for the subscribers of a magazine for which personal preferences are stored in preferences database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> then queries preferences database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> by index number for records (step <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>). Alternatively, preferences database <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> may be queried by customer number (e.g., where a subscriber only has one associated preferences record). Central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> then queries each preferences record for matches with content codes for each article in the current issue (step <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may seek matches for articles in issues other than the current issue, or for articles in a different magazine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, neither the content nor the preferences may have codes associated with them. In this embodiment the controller performs an intelligent query of the magazine content based on the preferences of the subscriber. The index is created, using a weighting method whereby the controller determines the relevance of any reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For example, the subscriber indicates a name or a company (e.g., &ldquo;Company A&rdquo;) in his list of preferences. The controller is programmed to query the magazine for all content where Company A is mentioned more than once within ten words of B, where B is some additional piece of preference information. For instance, the subscriber wants to see any articles about &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo; relevant to the Internet in Wired magazine. The controller would query the content record for Wired in search of any articles that mention &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo;. Once the articles have been identified the controller would again query for &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo; within three words of &ldquo;internet&rdquo; to determine the relevance of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Once the articles of interest are identified, central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> creates individual index records for each subscriber receiving that issue in issue database <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight>). Central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> stores magazine ID number, issue number, subscriber number, and index number in issue database <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>). Central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> stores all articles whose content code matches any stored in the subscriber&apos;s preference record in issue database <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> For example, according to various embodiments, central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> stores information about each of the indexed articles, such as, for example, the article name, the author, an article summary, content codes, corresponding hyper-footnotes, and/or corresponding page numbers associated with articles. According to alternative or additional embodiments, central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> stores an identifier for each article whose content code(s) matches any content of interest to the subscriber, as indicated in the preference record. Information for each indexed article may thus be found by querying content database <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> using the article identifier. Alternatively, or in addition, central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> stores the full text of each indexed article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Central controller <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> transmits magazine content, index information, and subscriber information to fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight>). This transmission may be carried out by mailing printouts, or documentation, containing this information or by electronic transmission, such as modem, network connection, or wireless transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows flowchart <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> representing a process in which fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> processes the personalized index information to construct magazines with customized indexes. Central controller <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> receives the data transmission, including the content and index information, from publisher <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>). Central controller <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> sends the content information to a bindery line to initiate the bindery process of constructing magazines (step <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>) and transmits subscriber name, address, and customized index information to a printer preferably located toward the end of the bindery line (step <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The printer prints mailing information and a customized index on an outer wrap (step <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>), which is placed at the end of the bindery line (step <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>) and attached to the respective magazines (step <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight>). In an alternative embodiment, the printer could print the mailing information and/or the customized index directly on or in the magazines without using an outer wrap. As previously mentioned, the index could be transmitted to the subscriber via facsimile, electronic mail, the Internet, phone, or any suitable means for communication. The related information necessary to perform such a transmission would be stored in the appropriate database, accessed accordingly, and used to execute the delivery. Fulfillment house <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> batches and ships the completed magazines, with the customized indexes, to respective subscribers, including subscriber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight>). This shipment may include conventional modes of delivering magazines, including mail, special delivery, and pick up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Although many of the embodiments have been described herein as being directed to one magazine, or to one issue of a magazine, various embodiments of the present invention provide for creating a customized index for a subscriber that includes index data related to one or more issues of a particular periodical. For example, a customized index attached to an Issue 10 of Periodical A may also include index data for Issue 01 of Periodical A. This might motivate the subscriber to attain a copy of Issue 01. In additional embodiments, a customized index may include index data for one or more periodicals. For example, a customized index attached to an issue of Periodical B may include index data corresponding to one or more issues of Periodical A. In this way, a publisher may encourage a subscriber to one periodical to seek out and possibly subscribe to another periodical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Methods and systems consistent with the present invention allow subscribers to receive periodicals, such as magazines, for which custom indexes are provided. The indexes identify the standard printed content contained in one or more periodicals that match respective subscribers&apos; preferences. In this way, a subscriber can quickly identify whether a periodical contains standard printed content of interest to him, what the standard printed content is, and where in the magazine it is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described, a system consistent with this invention comprises various methods of manufacturing a customized index for use with a periodical. One method comprises the steps of receiving personal preference data indicative of at least one content category of interest to a subscriber; receiving content data relating to the standard printed content of a periodical; comparing said content data with said personal preference data; generating index data based upon said comparison; and outputting a customized index containing said index data for use with said periodical. The customized index may be attached to a periodical, thereby providing a periodical having a customized index to standard content. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> According to other embodiments, an index for use with a periodical is delivered to a subscriber. The index is customized to identify standard printed content of interest to a subscriber according to preselected personal preferences indicative of at least one content category of interest to a subscriber, the identified standard printed content of interest being contained in the periodical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a practical and economically feasible system for publishers to indicate to their readers the availability of valuable supplement information, which is often developed in the routine process of business but otherwise wasted, related to information found in print material. This is accomplished by providing readers with hyper-footnotes in a customized index, a simple means to identify whether supplemental information exists that relates to standard printed content of interest to the subscriber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Conclusion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the method and system of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. The present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
