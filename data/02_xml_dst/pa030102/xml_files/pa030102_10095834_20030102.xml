<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a system for controlling the flow of a sample fluid through a substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is shown in a perspective view by way of example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In this embodiment the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made as a laminated array-membrane comprising upper and lower outer layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an intermediate strip of aluminium oxide. The outer layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are provided with four openings <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the openings <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the upper and lower layers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being aligned. In this manner the strip of aluminium oxide is exposed at four areas or wells <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The strip of aluminium oxide comprises a large number of through-going capillary channels oriented mainly perpendicular to the upper and lower surfaces of the strip. The capillary pressure of the channels is very high. In a practical embodiment of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the channels in the strip of aluminium oxide may have a spacing of approximately 150-200 nm, wherein a binding substance is bound to the substrate in groups of channels at a spacing of 200 mm. A group of channels can be indicated as a dot or dot area. Each area <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may have approximately 400 dots. For a further description of the substrate reference is made to the above-mentioned international patent application PCT/US00/24885. It will be understood that the number of exposed areas of the substrate, the number of dots and the dimensions are mentioned by way of example only and may be varied as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> comprises a housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having an upper housing part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and a lower housing part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The upper and lower housing parts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> determine a chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for receiving the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is received in the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> together with a holding device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which includes an upper and lower structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, respectively. Both upper and lower structures <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are provided with four cylindrical extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mainly aligned with the areas <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The holding device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is made of a plastic material. The device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is further described in a co-pending patent application &ldquo;Device for holding a substrate&rdquo; of the same applicant, European Patent Application 01200947.8, filed Mar. 13, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> comprises cylindrical chamber sections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the upper and lower housing parts <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in which the cylindrical extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are received. In the upper housing part <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, these cylindrical chamber sections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are interconnected by a channel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> providing a connection between the cylindrical chamber sections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the environment of the housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, so that an ambient pressure reference is available in these upper cylindrical chamber sections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the lower housing part <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the cylindrical chamber sections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are also interconnected by a channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In this case the channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to a means for generating a pressure difference over the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown the means for generating a pressure difference over the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made as means to change the volume of the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, in this case the part of the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> under the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the means for generating a pressure difference are implemented as a cylinder piston assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is schematically shown in two cylindrical extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, so that only at the corresponding areas <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the sample fluid can be passed through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As schematically indicated by means of sealing rings <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, two cylindrical chamber sections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are sealed with respect to the channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so that a pressure difference over the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is only generated at the areas <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> where a sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> During transporting the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, substances in the sample fluid can be bound by the binding substance in these capillary channels. In order to allow a mutual comparison of test results, it is important to accurately control the time period for transporting the sample fluid through these capillary channels. In order to control this transport time in an accurate manner, the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is provided with means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for maintaining the pressure difference over the substrate at a controlled level during the transport of the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the capillary channels. Generally, said means <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> will be implemented in a programmable processing unit. Preferably the pressure difference is maintained at a constant level during the transport of the sample fluid. In order to determine the time period during which the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is transported through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> comprises means for setting a desired pressure difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the means for generating a pressure difference over the substrate to transport the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from the upper surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the lower surface is implemented as a cylinder piston assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is moveable by means of a schematically indicated actuator <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. This actuator <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or control device is controlled by the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in dependence on the pressure in the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> as measured by means of a schematically indicated pressure measuring device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Assuming that at the beginning of an assay the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is located in the upper cylindrical extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> starts to generate a pressure difference over the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by generating in the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> under the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a pressure lower than the ambient pressure. This pressure difference transports the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> will gradually be transported towards the lower cylindrical extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the lower structure <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This would result in an increase of the pressure in the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> under the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and this pressure increase is measured by the measuring device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In view of this pressure increase as measured by the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> operates the actuator <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to displace the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to maintain the pressure difference at a constant level. In this manner the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is transported through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in an accurately determined time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Generally the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> should be transported through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a number of times in order to allow for a sufficient binding action of the binding substance in the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In order to reduce the overall time of the assay, it is important to reduce the time required for reversing the transport of the sample fluid through the capillary channels. In the system described, the time for reversing the transport is reduced by monitoring the operation of the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for maintaining the pressure difference at a constant level. As soon as the processing unit stops to operate the actuator <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for maintaining the pressure difference at a constant level, the pressure difference over the substrate is changed immediately in such a manner that the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is transported in the reverse direction from the lower surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> towards the upper surface through the capillary channels. For, as soon as the pressure difference remains constant without any displacement of the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, this is an indication that the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is completely transported through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. To change the pressure difference, the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is displaced in the opposite direction by the actuator <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is transported towards the upper surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thereby the pressure in the chamber <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> under the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> would decrease and this is measured by the measuring device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> operates the actuator <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to displace the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to maintain the pressure difference at a constant level. In this manner the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be transported in opposite directions through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a minimum time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the pressure difference required to transport the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is much lower than the capillary pressure of the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In this manner it is prevented that the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is pushed off the upper or lower surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the sample fluid is completely transported through the channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the system described, the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is adapted to measure the change of volume required to transport the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> completely through the capillary channels from the upper to the lower surface and vice versa. The change of volume can be measured for example by measuring the displacement of the piston <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This change of volume should be constant for each transport step of the system, i.e. each time the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is transported from the upper to the lower surface or vice versa. If the change of volume required to completely transport the sample fluid varies, this is an indication that a leak is present somewhere in the system so that the system should be checked by an operator. The processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can provide a warning indication to signal an operator a variation in the change of volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Further, the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can measure the change of volume required to transport the sample fluid completely through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in order to compare this change of volume with the initial volume of the sample fluid <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> provided in the cylindrical extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This initial volume can be provided as an input to the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As an alternative, the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> could also be used to automatically provide a predetermined initial volume in the cylindrical extensions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for performing an assay. If a difference between the initial volume and the required change of volume is measured, this is also an indication of a leak in the system. This difference can be indicated by the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to warn an operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the system described is that the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can measure the time to transport the sample fluid through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i.e. the flow rate. If this time or flow rate varies this is an indication that an air bubble or a contamination is blocking at least a part of the capillary channels. As the flow resistance of the substrate and the pressure used to transport the fluid are known or can be established, the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can determine the flow rate and/or the time required to transport an amount of the sample fluid through the substrate. Any deviation from the expected time or flow rate can be used as an indication of an error situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The system described shows the advantage that a washing operation to clean the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be carried out in an easy manner. According to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 a</cross-reference> washing device <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is placed on top of the housing <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> after removal of an upper glass cover <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> normally located on top of the housing S. The glass cover allows a direct vision on to the upper surface of substrate areas <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> during transport of the sample fluid <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through the channels. The washing device <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is provided with washing fluid feed and discharge tubes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Washing is performed in a programmable manner. For example, a all washing fluid can be can be fed on top of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the washing fluid can be transported through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a number of times and the washing fluid can be discharged. Discharging of the washing fluid may occur for example in a continuous flow at a slightly higher rate than feeding. If the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> generates a positive pressure under the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> the washing fluid will stay on top of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. By generating a negative pressure under the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the washing fluid is transported through the capillary channels of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the lower side in the same manner as described for a sample fluid. By reversing the pressure difference the washing fluid is transported back to the upper side of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> again. In this manner the capillary channels of the substrate can be cleaned in an efficient manner. Contamination of the channel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is prevented as the washing fluid will not be pushed off of the lower side of the substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The washing device is connected to a source of washing fluid not shown by means of schematically indicated tubes <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The washing operation is controlled by the processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
