<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, one object of this invention is the production of fire-resistant protective gels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another object is the production of fire-resistant construction materials having improved fire-resistive protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another object of this invention is the production of fire-resistant transparent materials that are sufficiently thin and made in larger sizes than conventional fire-resistant transparent materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> These and other objects are addressed by the manufacture of fire-resistant polymer materials comprising a polymer and one or more added fire-retardant chemicals. In aspects of this invention a plurality of fire-retardant chemicals maybe added to the gel to improve fire resistance. Further improvements in fire resistance can be achieved by cross-lining fire retardant chemicals with the polymer. We have unexpectedly found that certain fire-retardant chemicals can cross-link with the polymer material, can increase the stability of the polymer material, and/or can increase the retention of the fire-retardant chemical within the polymer, and thereby can improve the fire-resistance of the polymerized material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments of this invention provide fire-resistant polymers having low amounts of un-polymerized monomers, thereby providing increased mechanical strength of the polymer material. In such polymers, fire-retardant chemical can be strongly associated with the matrix of the polymer, thereby decreasing the loss ofany fire-retardant chemical from the polymer. By decreasing the loss of fire-retardant chemicals from the polymer, the fire-resistance of the polymer material can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Fire-resistant polymer materials can be used in a variety of different applications in the construction industry. In certain embodiments, fire-resistant transparent materials comprise one or more plates of transparent material having a fire-resistant polymer material on a surface or a portion of a surface. In other embodiments, a plurality (two or more) plates of transparent material can be separated by one or more gel-compatible spacers defining one or more gel spaces, and having a gel within at least one portion of at least one gel space, comprising a polymer material and a fire-retardant chemical. Fire-resistant materials can be placed inside doors or walls to provide fire protection. In other embodiments, fire-resistant materials can be coated onto surfaces of an object, such as a structure, to be exposed to fire, and thereby can protect that object from destruction. Additionally, fire-resistant gels can be incorporated into fabrics or felts for use in clothing or other flexible materials. In yet other embodiments, fire-resistant gels can be used in the maritime industries to protect ship hulls from fire. In certain of these embodiments, fire-retardant gel can be provided between hulls of double-hulled vessels. In other embodiments, a radiation shielding material, by way of example, lead metal, can be used to provide transparent, fire-resistant, radiation shields for use in the nuclear power industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Certain fire-retardant polymer materials can, when heated, produce a char having a dark surface on the side of the gel facing the source of heat (the inside surface of the gel) and a light surface on the outside surface of the gel facing the exterior of the heated space. When a fire-retardant chemical is polymerized along with the polymer matrix, the char can remain attached to the surface of the polymer on the side exposed to heat. The presence of such an attached char improves the fire-resistance properties of the polymer. In contrast, for materials in which the fire-retardant chemical is not polymerized with the matrix, the ashes tend to fall off, thereby exposing other portions of the polymer, thereby decreasing the fire-resistance of the polymer. Moreover, polymers of this invention can be intumescent, that is, when heated, bubbles can form, thereby increasing the thickness of the polymer, thereby increasing fire-resistance. Transparent fire-resistant materials of this invention can exhibit better fire-resistance than prior art materials, and therefore can be made thinner, with larger surface areas and therefore can have more desirable optical properties than prior art materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the transparent materials comprise glass, plastic or any other transparent material known in the glazing arts. The transparent material also can include annealed or laminated materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In certain other embodiments, methods for manufacturing fire-resistant transparent materials are provided.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Fire-resistant polymers of this invention include materials that, above 10&deg; C. and below 90&deg; C., are transparent and substantially bubble-free. However, when heated, such as upon exposure to fire, certain fire-resistant polymers of this invention do not degrade rapidly, but rather, can form a char layer of charred polymer material, may expand (i.e., is &ldquo;intumescent&rdquo;), or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It can be highly desirable to provide a polymer material that both forms a char and is intumescent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Fire-resistant transparent materials include embodiments in which a sheet or plate of transparent material has at least a portion of a surface having a fire-resistant material adhered thereto. In other embodiments, two or more sheets or plates of transparent material are arranged parallel to each other, forming a gap between them. Spacers can be used to hold the sheets or plates in proper alignment with each other. A fire-retardant chemical can be added to a polymer material, thereby forming a fire-retardant polymer gel, which can then be introduced into the space between the sheets. Once the polymer solidifies, the article can be prepared for particular applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments of this invention, the transparent sheet or plate materials can be any material known in the art to be transparent and to be compatible with the temperature of the environment and with the fire-retardant material between the plates of transparent material. For example, apiece of transparent plate material can be &frac18;&Prime;, {fraction (3/16)}&Prime;, &frac14;&Prime;, &frac12;&Prime; or greater in thickness. However, for other applications, the transparent material can have any other desired dimension. In addition to tempered glass, laminated glass, plastics, fiberglass or any other transparent material known in the art may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Pieces of transparent material can be separated by spacers composed of any gel- or polymer-compatible material. Examples of such gel-compatible material includes glass, ceramic, plastic, fiberglass and masonite. Other gel-compatible materials are known in the art, and all can be incorporated into the fire-resistant transparent materials of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> I. Manufacture of Fire-Resistant Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In general, polymers or gels suitable for use in this invention can include a polymer, a fire-retardant chemical an polymerization initiator, a polymerization accelerator, and/or a chelator. Generally, any polymer material that is compatible with the supporting material and can associate with the fire-retardant chemical can be used. Byway of example, a variety of silicas, acrylamides, plastics, aquagels and related materials are suitable. In certain examples, acrylamide polymers are desirable because they can be prepared easily from readily available materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Acrylamide (2-propeneamide; acrylic acid amide; C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>NO) can be used to form polyacrylamide gels. Acrylamide can be used as a cross-linking agent for styrene based polyester resins, and can copolymerize with vinylidene chloride to form polyacrylates. Similarly, N-methylolacrylamide (C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), N-N-methylenebisacrylamide and similar materials can be used to make acrylamide polymers. Formaldehyde (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) and urea (CH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) can be used to make so-called &ldquo;urea&rdquo; gels. Urea gels can also be made with melamine and acetaldehyde. Formaldehyde can also be used with melamine and/or phenols to make gels suitable foruse in aspects of this invention. Propylene oxide (C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>O) can be used with polyethers, such as poly(ethylene propylene) glycol to make polyether polyol polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Various epoxy resins, polyesters, polyurethanes and polyvinylbutyrates, poloxamers (synthetic block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide), polyethylene glycol (polymers of ethylene oxide and water; PEG), polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (formed from ethylene oxide and methanol) and polysorbates (formed from fatty acid esters of sorbitol copolymerized with ethylene oxide), and carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid cross-linked with allyl ethers) can be used as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, silicates maybe advantageously used. Silicas comprises silicon dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) either in amorphous form or cross-linked to form crystalline structures. Silicates can be made from organic siloxanes or silanes. For example, tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS) is a molecule having the chemical formula: Si(O&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. When treated under acidic or alkaline conditions, the TEOS molecule can decompose into reactive intermediates including Si(O<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. This intermediate can react with others to form polymers of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. For such silicates, the type of precursor molecule is not crucial. Upon hydrolysis, TEOS produces ethyl alcohol. Chemically related alkylsilicates include tetramethylorthosilane (MEOS), and tetrapropylorthosilane (PEOS). It can be readily appreciated that other alkylsiloxanes can be precursors for silicates. It can be appreciated that numerous other types ofpolymers can be used to make fire-retardant gels of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Similarly, numerous fire-retardant chemicals can be used. Several classes of fire-retardants that are suitable include reactive organic phosphorous monomers, diols and polyols, oligomeric phosphate-phosphonates, tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts, oligomeric vinylphosphonates, phosphites, and a variety of other phosphorous-containing polymers. Additionally, mesylated and tosylated celluloses may be used. Three general classes of fire retardants include antimony and other inorganic flame retardants, halogenated flame retardants, and phosphorous-containing flame retardants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Thus, a variety of soluble retardants can be sued, and include salts containing bromine, chlorine, antimony, tin, molybdenum, phosphorous, aluminum and/or magnesium. Specifically, sodium antimonite, boric acid, sodium borate, stannous fluoride, stannous chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, ammonium phosphates, and melamine phosphates can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Moreover, numerous reactive flame retardants maybe used. By &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; we mean that the fire-retardant chemical can for an interaction with the polymer material, the interaction characterized by increased affinity of the fire-retardant chemical with the polymer material. Increased affinity can be reflected in a tendency for the fire-retardant chemical to remain associated with the polymer. This interaction is in contrast with a simple mixture, in which the fire-retardant chemical and the polymer do not have any affinity for each other. The association of the fire-retardant chemical and the polymer can provide substantially increased fire resistance of the polymer. Examples of such interactions include the formation of covalent bonds, ionic bonds, Van Der Walls interactions and physical trapping of the chemical within the matrix of the polymer. However, any type of interaction that promotes the formation of a stable combination of fire-retardant chemical and the polymer matrix can provide improved fire-resistance. Reactive fire-retardant chemicals include, by way of example only, organophosphorous monomers, phosphorous-containing diols and polyols, phosphonomethylated ethers, amide-based systems with cyanamine, halogenated alkyl phosphates and phosphonates, and dialkyl phosphites and related materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The mechanism(s) of action of fire-resistant materials are not known with certainty. Without being limited to any particular theory or operability or mechanism of action, several mechanisms have been proposed. Halogenated flame retardants may function in a vapor phase either as a diluent or a heat sink or as a free-radical trap that stops or slows flame propagation. Phosphorous compound may function in a solid phase by forming a glaze or coating over substrates, there by preventing heat and/or oxidant from being maintained as required for sustained combustion. However, the scope of this invention is not intended to be limited to any particular theory for operability. The fire-resistant materials may work by one or more of the above mechanisms, or may operate by another, undefined mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Further descriptions of these fire-resistant materials are included in the Kirk Othmer Chemical Encyclopedia, volume 10. By way of example only, fire-retardant chemicals that can be used in conjunction with this invention include bromine and chlorine for a total of about 60%, organic halogen compounds, phosphorous containing polyol, boron-phosphate, modified organic halogens, di-linoleic acid/tri-linoleic acid/ethylene diamine copolymers, polyphosphate-nitrogen liquid, inorganic salts, acrylic polymer compounds, dibutyl butylphosphonate, antimony oxide, antimony peroxide, sodium borate, barium metaborate, alumina trihydrate, magnesium hydroxide, decabromodiphenyl oxides, vinyl bromide, dimethylphosphonate, and/or dibromoneopentyl glycol, Pyrovatex&trade; (dialkyl phosphorus carboxyl amide TMM; CIBA Specialty Chemicals), Pyrovatex CP New&trade; (dialkyl phosphorus carboxyl amide), Fyrol99&trade; (oligomeric 2-chloroethylphosphate; Akzo Nobel Chemicals, Inc.), Fyrol DMPP&trade; (dimethyl methylphosphonate; Akzo Nobel Chemicals, Inc.), Barfire PCR&trade; (Apollo Chemical Corporation), Barfire RE&trade; (&ldquo;organic phosphate Y;&rdquo; Apollo Chemical Corporation), Eaglechlor 10&trade; (&ldquo;chlorinated parrafin W;&rdquo; Eagle Systems Corporation), Eagleban F/RP-85NE (&ldquo;Organic Phosphate X;&rdquo; Eagle Systems Corporation) and Flamort X&trade; (&ldquo;NT Aqua Fire Retardant;&rdquo; Flamort Company Inc.); D &ldquo;decabromodiphenyl oxide-polyacrylate.&rdquo; Mineral hydrates, such as alumina tritrihydrate and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate maybe used in thermoset resins. These materials can be used singly or in combination without departing from the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In fact, we have observed that flame retardants which belong to more than one class of flame retardant were more effective than those retardants belonging to only one class. By way of example only, panels prepared with magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)*6H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) performed better in burn tests than samples prepared with the same amount of sodium chloride (NaCl). We attribute the increased efficacy of the MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>solution to the fact that the material is both a metal halide (as is NaCl) and is a mineral hydrate, unlike NaCl, which is not hydrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In certain specific embodiments, the gel composition can comprise about 25% base monomer, which comprises about 44% distilled water, about 44% acrylamide, 0.13% methylene bisacrylamide, and about 12% formaldehyde. To the base monomer solution, about 12% magnesium chloride, about 51% distilled water, about 10% of a fire retardant, about 2% sodium persulfate and less than about 1% sodium tungstate can be used. In other embodiments, ammonium persulfate can be used. Other types of gels can be used satisfactorily if they are compatible with the fire-retardant chemical. Once formulated, gel is placed between the pieces of transparent material and the edges are sealed to form an intact piece of transparent, fire-resistant material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It can be desirable to control the time needed for polymerization of the gels of this invention. Lag time is the time taken for a mixed solution of gel to polymerize. Lag time should be sufficiently long to permit the filling of spaces between panels before polymerization occurs. If the gel polymerizes too soon, then bubbles and other defects may appear in the gel, decreasing its performance and transparency. On the other hand, lag time should be sufficiently short to that once poured, the gel polymerizes completely within a desirably short time thereafter. Moreover, if the lag time is too long, the polymerization may not be complete, and free, unpolymerized monomers may remain in the gel. Unpolymerized monomers can decrease the efficiency of cross-linking the fire-retardant with the gel polymer, decreasing fire resistance of the finished product. Unpolymerized monomers can react later when the panel is exposed to heat and/or UV light. Those post polymerization reactions may cause cracks and bubbles within the finished panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> To increase lag time, one can decrease the amount of catalyst in the gel mixture, increase the pH, provide some oxygen, and/or add sufficient sodium metabisulfite to scavenge only a portion of the oxygen in the gel. If too little catalyst is used however, polymerization may not be complete and unpolymerized monomers may contaminate the gel, degrading its fire-resistant properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> II. Manufacture of Fire-Resistant Transparent Materials </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> To manufacture fire-retardant transparent materials of this invention, transparent plates are provided and aligned in approximately parallel fashion, with their facing surfaces separated by a gap to be filled with fire-retardant gel. The gel material is typically-manufactured using conventional methods. However, fire-retardant chemicals can be added to increase the ability of the gel and the transparent material to withstand elevated temperatures without incurring undesirable damage. In certain embodiments, the gel material can be manufactured using aqueous monomer solutions to which all components are added, then the mixture can be degassed before addition of polymerization initiators. Once polymerization initiators are added, the gel is pumped into the gap between the transparent plates and permitted to polymerize. After polymerization has taken place, the fire-resistant transparent material can be subsequently used to provide a transparent cover for a variety of different applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The fire-retardant material can either be made in a desired configuration or shape, such as circular, rectangular, triangular, or other desired shape. Alternatively, the fire-retardant material can be subsequently processed into desired shapes using methods known in the art. Once manufactured, the fire-retardant material can be inserted into, for example, a window, a door, or can be enclosed in a frame. In certain embodiments, a gel of this invention can be placed within walls, either in place of insulation, or in addition to insulation. For example, a wall made of two panels of wall-forming material, such as sheet rock, can be prepared with a gap between them, defining an interior space. Then, gel of this invention can be provided within the space to increase the fire-resistance of the wall. In certain of these embodiments, fire-resistant gel can be provided on one sheet of the wall-forming material, or alternatively, gel can be provided on both sheets of wall-forming material. In yet other embodiments, the entire space between wall-forming materials can be filled with fire-resistant gels of this invention. If desired, one can also provide thermal insulating material along with the gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> III. Uses of Fire-Resistant Polymer Materials </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Additionally, for certain uses, the fire-resistant gels of this invention can be applied to an exterior surface of an object, such as a structure. If such structures are near a fire, the fire-resistant gel can protect the structure from damage. The applications include those for schools, hospitals, factories, property lines and anyplace requiring a fire rating for safety of persons or property. The fire-resistant materials can be thinner, weigh less, have larger surface area, and can be more aesthetically pleasing than prior art fire-resistant transparent materials. The fire-resistant material can be used for any construction purpose where vision, radiant heat protection, safety and a fire rating is required. The materials of this invention therefore can have desirable performance characteristics in forms having larger surface areas (&ldquo;lite sizes&rdquo;) and smaller thicknesses than available in the prior art. Fire-resistant polymer materials can be applied in gel forms, foams and the like. It can be desirable to apply the mixture prior to polymerization, and to permit the material to polymerize before it is exposed to heat sufficient to cause damage to the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the nuclear power industry, it can be desirable to provide materials in nuclear reactor facilities that are both fire-resistant and radiation resistant. In certain embodiments, radiation shielding materials can be incorporated into the gels of this invention. Byway of example only, lead(Pb) particles or salts thereof can be added to the gel material in sizes from atomic size to microparticle dimensions of about 10-100 micrometers (&mgr;M). In certain of these embodiments used for windows, it can be desirable to use particles having sizes sufficiently small to maintain optical transparency of the gel. However, complete optical transparency is not necessary in all embodiments, and some embodiments can incorporate relatively larger amounts of radiation shield material and have somewhat reduced transparency, but without adversely affecting the desirable properties of the window. In other embodiments, in which optical transparency is not needed, the fire-resistant gels of this invention can be incorporated into containment vessels, concrete housing structures, bunkers, pipes, coolant systems, and other structures where fire-resistance and radiation shielding are desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Yet other embodiments of this invention include the manufacture of fire-resistant hulls for vessels, such as tanker ships that can carry flammable materials, such as gasoline, oil, kerosine, diesel fuel and the like. A coating of fire-resistant gel on the inside of a single hull can provide increased protection of the vessel&apos;s contents in situations in which fire on the exterior of the vessel is encountered. In other embodiments, double-hulled vessels can have fire-resistant gel placed in the space between the two hulls. In these embodiments, the gel can fill the space, thereby preventing flammable liquids or gasses from having access to the space between the hulls. Thus, the likelihood of fire between the vessel&apos;s hulls can be substantially decreased, thereby increasing the integrity of the hull, and thereby decreasing the likelihood of spills into the environment. Additionally, the fire-resistant properties of the gel can inhibit the spread of fire. In other embodiments, fire-resistant gels can be incorporated into other structures on vessels, including engine rooms, fuel lines and other structures that can be subjected to fire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Similarly, land or airborne vehicles can incorporate fire-resistant gels of this invention. Such vehicles include cars, busses, trains, airplanes, rockets and the like. In these vehicles, the light weight of the fire-resistant gel can provide improved fire resistance without compromising the function of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In other applications, fire-resistant gels of this invention can be incorporated into fabrics, including both woven fabrics or felts. Incorporation of the gels of this invention into clothing can provide fire-resistant clothing for firefighters and other persons who maybe exposed to high temperatures. Gloves, socks, shoes, boots, gaiters, pants, shirts, vests, jackets, hats, masks, and may other types of clothing articles can be made fire-resistant by incorporation of the gels of this invention. In certain situations, in which it is necessary to provide a firefighter with breathing apparatus, the fire-resistant gels and materials of this invention can provide improved fire protection. Thus, hoses, cylinders, face masks, gauges, regulators, and the like can benefit from incorporation of fire-resistant materials of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In yet other embodiments, insulating materials can be incorporated into gels of this invention. Thus, gels comprising such fibers as Kevlar&trade;, Nomex&trade;, fiberglass, asbestos and other insulating materials can provide both fire resistance and resistance to undesired heating or cooling. </paragraph>

To manufacture the monomer solution, we heated an aliquot of distilled water in a chemically inert vessel to a temperature of about 55&deg; C. and added a sufficient amount of a 20% NaOH solution to raise the pH of the solution was between about 9.5 to about 10. We then slowly added 44% by weight of powdered acrylamide, with constant stirring, and maintained the temperature at about 38&deg; C. or greater. The temperature then was allowed to increase to 55&deg; C after which time we added 12% of a 37% solution of formaldehyde. We maintained the temperature of the solution at about 55&deg; C. and stirred the solution for 2 hours, after which time, we transferred the monomer solution to a plastic drum. Alternatively, the following formula is suitable for manufacturing a monomer solution. </paragraph>

We then lowered a high-speed stirrer into the solution and stirred the solution for 3 minutes. We then reduced the temperature of the solution to 13&deg; C. and added sufficient of the following materials to achieve the overall percentages indicated based on of the total monomer content in solution; triethanolamine to 0.45%, sodium persulfate 0.15% and sodium tungstate 0.03% and sufficient EDTA to chelate the copper which is added to Flocryl 52 ST&trade; to stabilize it and prevent polymerization and stirred for an additional 3 minutes. The mixture was then placed in a 250 liter container, the air was removed to decrease the formation of bubbles in the gel. The air had to be removed because the polymerization is a free radical step polymerization and oxygen is a free radical scavenger, which, if present, can decrease the efficiency of polymerization. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Heat of Polymerization </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> We have found that under certain circumstances, the heat of polymerization of a fire-retardant gel mixture can be greater than that expected based on the polymerization of the gel alone. It is reported that the heat of polymerization of acrylamide gels is 20.4 Kcal/gm mole. It is also known that during polymerization of acrylamide gels, a 3&deg; C. increase per 1% of monomer (on a dry basis) indicates complete polymerization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> We mixed a sample of(5% weight/weight) of NMA2820, a product manufactured byFlocryl&trade;; 15% (weight/weight) of Bio-Acrylamide 50&trade; (a 50% acrylamide solution in water with stabilizers), a product manufactured by Flocryl&trade;, and Pyrovatex CP New&trade; together and monitored the temperature of the mixture during polymerization. To monitor the heat of polymerization, we used a scanning thermocouple thermometer interfaced with a computer capable of recording the temperature of a solution. Data was collected from samples of gel immediately after mixing the components together. The temperature data was collected and stored in a memory device associated with the computer, and the lag time, initial temperature, maximum temperature, and the change in temperature (maximum temperature&minus;initial temperature) were recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> According to one theory, the temperature increase&equals;3&times;(&lsqb;% NMA2820&rsqb;&times;0.48)&plus;(&lsqb;% Bio-acrylamide&rsqb;&times;0.5)&plus;&lsqb;% N,N&prime;-methylolbisacrylamide&rsqb;. Thus, the predicted temperature increase would be 3&times;(5&times;0.48)&plus;(15&times;0.5)&plus;(0.008)&equals;3&times;9.908&equals;29.724&deg; C. However, we unexpectedly found that the difference in temperature was 32.9&deg; C., indicating that more heat was released during the reaction (10.77% more) than could be accounted for by 100% polymerization of the acrylamide and N,N&prime;-methylolbisacrylamide alone. Thus, we conclude that the excess heat generated during the polymerization reaction arose from polymerization of the fire-retardant material into the matrix of the acrylamide gel. Although we do not intend to be bound to any particular theory to account for the increased heat of polymerization observed, the increased heat released may indicate that the fire-resistant material formed covalent bonds with the polymers in the gel through an exothermic reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts results of a typical experiment in which we monitored the temperature of a polymerization mixture during polymerization. After a lag period of about 16 minutes, the temperature increased rapidly to a maximum of about 56&deg; C. at about 26 minutes. The temperature thereafter decreased slowly, so that after 109 minutes, the temperature was about 32&deg; C. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In another study, we made a series of gels having acrylamide monomers in the range of between about 8 and about 12% (weight/weight). The amounts of acrylamide, -methylolacrylamide and N,N&prime;-methylenebisacrylamide were selected to form a gel which is tacky and flexible enough to deform without cracking yet resilient enough to stay in place when the glazing, facing the fire during abum test, breaks or shatters. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to above about 8.5 using a dilute solution 1% (w/w) solution of alkali such as sodium hydroxide in water, and sufficient urea was added to scavenge formaldehyde in Pyrovatex CP New&trade;. This decreased the hydrolysis of the Pyrovatex CP New&trade; and/or decreases the formation and precipitation of magnesium hydroxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In alternative embodiments, an oxygen scavenger such as sodium metabisulfite can be used as an oxygen scavenger, or degassing using vacuum can be used to decrease the amount of oxygen in the gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A ratio of triethanolamine (TEA) to sodium persulfate was chosen to promote complete polymerization (about 4 parts per million (ppm)) of residual acrylamide monomer. A sample of the gel described in Example 1 was dried and assayed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and we determined that there was 0.46% of free acrylamide and 0.55% free NMA. The amount of free monomers is substantially less than prior art gels.
