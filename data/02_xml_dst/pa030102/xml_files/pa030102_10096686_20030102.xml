<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to saddlery and particularly to a saddle cinch having a buckle which permits easy adjustment of the cinch about the body of a horse to secure the saddle thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Most saddles are secured on a horse by means of a cinch or girth strap which is connected to both sides of the saddle and passes beneath the body of the horse. One side of the cinch is permanently or removably connected to one side of the saddle by a flexible strap with the other side being constructed to be removably attached to the saddle to enable the cinch to be placed about the body of the horse and then tightened. When the cinch strap is first tightened about the horses body, the horse will bloat in an attempt to resist the pressure of the tightened strap. This requires the cinch and connecting strap to be readjusted and tightened several times until the proper tension is reached on the cinch and connecting straps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One type of cinch has a buckle on one end about which a strap is looped one or more times through the buckle and through an opening in the saddle such as provided by a D-ring, before securing the strap in an adjusted position by either a tongue on the buckle or by looping the strap about itself before being terminated in a locking loop. In those cinches having a buckle through which the strap makes several loops, it requires considerable pulling pressure by the horseman in order to tighten the cinch about the horse due to the leather strap being lopped upon itself resulting in a leather-to-leather sliding contact with the resultant large friction force occurring therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the need exists for an improved cinch, and in particular a tightening and securement buckle therefore, which requires less force on the part of the horseman when tightening the cinch about the body of the horse to secure the saddle thereon. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a cinch and in particular a buckle therefore, for securing the saddle onto the body of the horse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The cinch buckle of the invention comprises a rigid frame preferably having a trapezoidal configuration with a base bar, an intermediate bar and an outer end bar extending between a pair of sloped side frame members providing two strap receiving apertures therein for looping a tightening strap therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The cinch buckle of the invention further has a pair of rollers rotatably mounted on two of the buckle frame bars to reduce the sliding friction as the strap is looped and tightened about the intermediate and outer bars of the buckle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention enables a locking tongue to be secured to the buckle by extending through a hole formed in the free end of the tightening strap to positively lock the strap in an adjusted position in the buckle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the invention is providing the cinch with a protective pad which extends beyond a pair of end buckles on the cinch to protect the horse&apos;s belly from contact with the metal buckles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Still another feature of the invention is providing a method of easily tightening a cinch about the body of a horse to secure the saddle thereon by providing rolling friction instead of the heretofore leather-to-leather sliding friction as the cinch strap is tightened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The foregoing advantages, construction and operation of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following description and accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A usual type of riding saddle is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and is indicated generally at <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Saddle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a western style saddle having a horn <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a relatively deep seat <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. However, the cinch buckle of the present invention is applicable to other types of saddles than that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and need not be limited to western type saddles. Saddle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a D-ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is rigidly connected to the saddle apron <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by rivets <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or other type of connections. A cinch indicated generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is shown in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and is connected by a strap <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to one side of saddle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by some type of attachment means either permanent or removable, such as a buckle or D-ring for a loop strap connection. Cinch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a protective pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> usually formed of felt or other type of soft material, to protect the underbelly of the horse and will have a short piece of flexible material or strap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> secured to pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, having a usual buckle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> permanently attached by a sewn hem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or the like at one end of strap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The improved cinch buckle of the present invention is indicated generally at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> attached by a sewn hem <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to strap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opposite of buckle <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, cinch buckle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a trapezoidal configuration with a base bar <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an intermediate bar <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and an outer end bar <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> all of which are connected or formed integrally with a pair of tapered side frame members <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> preferably have a circular cross sectional configuration as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. If desired, outer frame members <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, end bar <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and base bar <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be formed of a single piece of circular bar stocks secured together by a weld <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with intermediate bar <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> being welded at the ends thereof to side frame members <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Intermediate bar <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> forms a pair of apertures <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with spaced bars <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively. In further accordance with the invention, roller sleeves <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are rotatably mounted on frame bars <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively, so as to freely rotate thereon as best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. A locking tongue <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is movably mounted on base bar <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by a rolled end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> formed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The method of attaching saddle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a horse and manner of use of the improved cinch buckle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Cinch pad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has been removed for clarity. An elongated strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is secured to D-ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> such as by forming a loop at one end thereof and securing the same about ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by rivets <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Free end <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is placed through buckle aperture <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and formed into a loop about roller sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Pulling upwardly on strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> will begin tightening cinch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> about the horse&apos;s body. Free end <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is then inserted through the opening of D-ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and down and along a strap portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which extends between D-ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and roller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and then through aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The horseman then pulls again in a generally upward direction as shown by arrow F which will roll the strap along roller sleeve <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to tighten the cinch further around the horses body. The upward movement of strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> about sleeve <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> will also move the strap about roller sleeve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> until the desired initial tension is placed on the cinch and strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The free end of strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> will be pulled upward again to further tighten the cinch about the horses body. This tightening and retightening procedure may have to be repeated several times until the desired tension has been achieved on cinch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and straps <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> until the bloating of the horse has been overcome. However, each time an upward outward force is exerted on free end <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the strap loops will roll along sleeves <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> avoiding the heretofore leather-on-leather or leather-to-metal friction around a frame bar as in prior cinch buckle constructions. After the desired tension has been reached, tongue <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is then rotated until it extends through a selected hole <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> formed in strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and is forced against intermediate bar <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to lock the strap in its tightened position. The tension in the direction of arrow A on strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, will securely clamp the tongue in this locked position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is readily seen that the cinch and connecting straps can be repeatedly tightened by pulling outwardly upwardly on free end <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in a similar manner as with a usual buckle. However, the double looping of the strap about the two roller sleeves <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> considerably reduces the friction that must be overcome by the pulling force, enabling sufficient force to be applied to the cinch to tighten it about the horses body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If desired, free end <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of strap <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> could be looped through D-ring <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and wrapped about the upper part of the triple thickness strap and tied off in a locking loop eliminating the need for tongue <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> without affecting the concept of the invention or preferred manner of use of buckle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the improved cinch buckle and method of use is simplified, provides an effective, safe, inexpensive, and efficient device and method which achieves all the enumerated objectives, provides for eliminating difficulties encountered with prior devices and methods, and solves problems and obtains new results in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clearness, and understanding; but no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirement of the prior art, because such terms are used for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the description and illustration of the invention is by way of example, and the scope of the invention is not limited to the exact details shown or described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Having now described the features, discoveries, and principles of the invention, the manner in which the cinch buckle and method of use is constructed and used, the characteristics of the construction, and the advantageous new and useful results obtained; the new and useful structures, devices, elements, arrangements, parts, combinations and method steps are set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
