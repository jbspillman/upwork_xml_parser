<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to valves, more particularly to outlet valves to control the flow of liquid. It will be convenient to describe the invention in relation to outlet valves for cisterns, especially water cisterns for use in toilets although it will be appreciated that the invention may have wider application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Environmental concerns about the excessive use of water has lead to numerous domestic practices aimed at reducing water wastage. One such practice involves the use of more water-efficient toilet flushing systems, in particular cisterns which allow the user the option of flushing using a full volume of water or a reduced volume. Building regulations differ from country to country but generally such regulations specify the particular minimum and maximum volumes of water to be used, for example a full flush of 6 litres and a half flush of 3 litres. Although the terms &ldquo;full flush&rdquo; and &ldquo;half flush&rdquo; are used throughout the description and claims of this specification, it will be appreciated by the skilled addressee that &ldquo;half flush&rdquo; is not necessarily exactly half the volume of a &ldquo;full flush&rdquo; but, for example, a full flush may equate to 9 litres and a half flush to 6 litres. The term &ldquo;half flush&rdquo; should therefore be considered to refer to any desired reduced flushing volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of dual-flush cistern outlet valves have been proposed and used. Many of these comprise apparatus for dividing the cistern into two separate reservoirs each having separate outlet valves: when a half flush is required, one of the outlet valves is opened so that one of the reservoirs empties. When a full flush is required, both valves are opened so that both reservoirs empty. These and many other dual-flush apparatus generally require two separate actuating systems to open the two valves. It is desirable to reduce the number of separately manufactured parts for a dual flush system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a dual flush outlet valve which can be made using a minimum of separate moveable parts. It is a further object to provide a dual flush outlet valve which can be suitably adjusted to allow a variety of full and half flush volumes without the need for differently dimensioned components so that the one apparatus can be used throughout the world and adjusted easily to comply with differing regulatory requirements on flushing volumes. It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a dual flush apparatus which utilises a pivoting or &lsquo;flapper&rdquo; valve rather than a plunger valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Most known dual flush outlet valves also have limited scope to provide variable or extra capacity for overfilling relief from the reservoir, for example In the case of failure of the reservoir filling valve to shut-off when the reservoir has been filled to its desired level. It is an object of another aspect of the present invention to provide a dual flush outlet valve with added fixed or variable overflow protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention there is provided a dual volume discharge apparatus for selectively discharging a full flush or a half flush of liquid from a reservoir, said discharge apparatus including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> actuator means selectively moveable from a closed position to either a full flush position or a half flush position, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> sealing means moveable by said actuator means from a closed position to either a full flush position or a half flush position, said sealing means being biased toward said closed position when in said half flush position, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> liquid outlet which is sealed by said sealing means to prevent flow of liquid out of said reservoir when said sealing means is in said closed position and which allows flow of liquid out of said reservoir when said sealing means is in the full flush position or the half flush position, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> stop means co-operable with said sealing means and being biased towards position capable of holding said sealing means in said half flush position when said actuator means is moved to said half flush position until a predetermined volume of liquid has been discharged from said reservoir and then allowing aid sealing means to move to said closed position thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The actuator means is selectively moveable from a closed position to either a full flush position or to a half flush position. The actuator means preferably further includes means for selecting either the half flush or full flush functions. In a preferred embodiment the actuator means includes twin selection means, a first selection means being adapted to move said actuator means from the closed position to the half flush position, and a second selection means being adapted to move the actuator means from the closed position to the full flush position. Said means may be in the form of a dual press-button device where each button when depressed causes the actuator means to move a certain distance, the two buttons each moving the actuator means a different distance. Preferably the half flush position is intermediate the closed and full flush positions and the distance the first selection means moves the actuator means when depressed by the user is less than the distance the second selection means moves the actuator means when depressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The actuator means moves the sealing means from a closed position to either a full flush position or to a half flush position. In a preferred embodiment the sealing means is a flapper-type valve and the actuator means acts on the sealing means to cause the sealing means to pivot between said closed, half flush and full flush positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The sealing means seals the liquid outlet when the actuator means is in. the closed position. When the sealing means is moved to either of the flush positions, the liquid outlet is opened and liquid in the reservoir is able to flow by gravity out of the liquid outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When in the half flush position, the sealing means is biased toward the closed position. Preferably this bias is caused by the resolved static and dynamic fluid and gravitational forces acting on the sealing means when the sealing means is in the half flush position. When the sealing means has been moved from the closed position, liquid will flow out of the reservoir causing a venturi effect. This will result in a lower pressure acting on the lower surface of the sealing means and a greater pressure acting on the upper surface of the sealing means, the resultant net forces acting to urge the sealing means toward the closed position. Preferably when the sealing means is a flapper-valve, less pivotal movement of the sealing means away from the liquid outlet is required to put the sealing means in the half flush position than in the full flush position. In other words, when the actuator means is moved to the half flush position, the sealing means moves a first distance away from the liquid outlet, but when the actuator means is moved to the full flush position, the sealing means moves a further distance away from the liquid outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably when the sealing means is in the full flush position, the resolved forces acting upon it urge It to remain in that position, at least until the liquid level in the reservoir drops to a point where the sealing means is no longer covered with liquid. The sealing means may include a float which provides a buoyant force greater than any downward acting forces on the sealing means such that it remains in the full flush open position while there is still water in the reservoir but when the water level drops to below the float, the lack of buoyancy will cause the sealing means to close. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The apparatus further includes stop means co-operable with the sealing means. The stop means is biased towards a position capable of holding said sealing means in a half flush position when the actuator is moved to the half flush position. The stop means then holds the sealing means in the half flush position until a predetermined volume of liquid has been discharged from the reservoir. Thereafter, the sealing means moves to the closed position so that no more liquid is able to flow out of the liquid outlet. In a preferred embodiment, the stop means includes a cam which is capable of moving into a locking position when the sealing means is moved into the half flush position and there it is engaged by cooperating latching means associated with the sealing means. The stop means may move into the locking position by way of a float which biases the stop means toward the locking position when the float is providing upward buoyant forces, i.e. when there is liquid at least partially around the float. When the liquid level has dropped so that the float no longer provides upward buoyant forces the stop means may move away from the locking position so that the resultant forces acting on the sealing means cause the latter to move to the closed position and thus prevent further outflow of water from the reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a dual volume discharge apparatus for discharging liquid from a reservoir, said apparatus including: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> a main liquid outlet communicating between said reservoir and a discharge passage, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> valve means selectively moveable between a closed position where liquid is prevented from flowing out of said reservoir into said discharge passage through said main liquid outlet and an open position where liquid is able to flow out of said reservoir into a discharge passage through said main liquid outlet, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> a first overflow passage having an outlet into said discharge passage and an inlet positioned at a selected fill level in said reservoir, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> at least one additional overflow passage having an outlet into said discharge passage and an inlet positioned at a selected fill level in said reservoir, such that when said valve means is in said closed position and liquid in said reservoir reaches said selected fill level liquid will flow into said overflow passages and flow into said discharge passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Preferably the additional overflow passage or passages are connected to the apparatus in parallel with the first overflow passage. The additional overflow passages may connect to the apparatus in a modular fashion by for example, a friction fit into an openable port in the apparatus. The additional discharge passages may have a telescopic extension sleeve allowing adjustment of the height of the inlet.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, activator means <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> collectively comprises half flush button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, full flush button <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, push rod <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and connecting arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Sealing means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> collectively comprises float seal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Liquid outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is located in apparatus body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Stop means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> collectively comprises float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and float guide <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Half and full flush buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are biased toward an upper position where they do not apply any force to the head of push rod unless they are being depressed by the user. Half and full flush buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are preferably mounted on the cover (not shown) of the cistern, and are exposed and visible to the user. The remaining parts of the apparatus are most suitably housed within the cistern and may be submerged under water when the cistern is full as is conventional in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Push rod <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> has adjustment stop <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on its shank <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which rests on an shoulder <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in connecting arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Preferably the adjustment stop <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be screwed to a selected position along a thread <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> on shank <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> so that the push rod <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to an optimal position relative to connecting arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and half and full flush buttons <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Alternative arrangements to a screw thread may be provided for the adjustment stop <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, although it is considered that a screw thread will provide the greatest degree of adjustability. Push rod <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may pass through a guide <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> so as to keep its motion (when activated by either of the flush buttons) substantially linear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the apparatus is shown in the closed position. This position correlates to the situation where the cistern is filled with water to the desired level and is ready to be activated to provide either a half flush or a full flush. Connecting arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> transfers linear downward motion of the push rod <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to hinge point <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> where surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of connection arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> contacts actuating end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Preferably connecting arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> passes around body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which acts as a guide to keep the motion of connecting arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> linear. Desirably cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is hinged about pivot <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has pivotally mounted thereon float seal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which consists of sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and float <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Preferably seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes recesses <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> on the upper side <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, said recesses <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> being capable of retaining water therein when the cistern is empty so as to provide ballast to the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> after the cistern has been emptied by a full flush. This ballast is the amount of water which can be retained in the recesses <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> will preferably be sufficient so as to weight down the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to cause the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> fall and come into contact with annular outlet rim <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> may include a lip <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> adapted to bear upon part <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of the upper surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to assist in sealing liquid outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> between pivot <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is hollow and incorporates internal overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> which extends from overflow inlet <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> communicates with toilet pan (not shown) such that water flushed from cistern flows into the toilet pan. and water flowing down the overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> will also flow into the pan. Overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> includes telescopic extension sleeve <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> co-axial with the overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and capable of being adjusted up or down along the axis <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. Accordingly the height of inlet <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> may be varied as desired so that the level reached by water in the cistern may be selected and determined by the degree to which the telescopic extension sleeve <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> has been extended. Telescopic extension sleeve <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> may include O-ring seal <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to ensure water does not flow from the cistern into the overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> through any gap between the overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and the extension sleeve <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. The extension sleeve <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> also preferably includes a locking clip <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to ensure that once it has been extended to a desired height, it is locked into position. Guide <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be connected to and extend from telescopic extension sleeve <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The apparatus may further include one or more additional overflow passages <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> in parallel with the overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> previously described. The additional overflow passage <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> or passages may be connected in a modular fashion to chamber <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. Similar to the primary overflow passage <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, the additional passage(s) may have a telescopic extension sleeve (not shown) allowing adjustment of the height of the respective overflow inlet <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, or alternatively the additional overflow passages <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> may be of fixed length. The additional overflow passages <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> may be provided to give further protection against overflow of the cistern if the cistern filling valve should fail and water continues to enter the cistern despite reaching the selected filling level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When in the closed position and when the cistern is full, the weight of water acting on the upper surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> will hold the gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> against the annular outlet rim <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and this will cause the hinge point <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of actuating end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to act upon surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of connecting arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to keep connecting arm <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and hence push rod <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in an upper position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Apparatus also includes stop means <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which facilitates and is essential to the half flushing function of the apparatus. Stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> comprises a body <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having a cam end <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, a float end <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and a hinge point <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> intermediate said ends <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. The hinge point <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is preferably hinged to the body <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is capable of pivoting between a locking position and a release position. On float end <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> there is a float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> which is adjustably mounted to track <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be adjusted along track <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to a desired height. When cistern is full of water, float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will preferably be submerged below the surface of the water so that it provides a buoyant force acting upwardly on hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Cam end <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes three cam surfaces; a closed cam surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, a half flush cam surface <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and a full flush cam surface <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. When the apparatus is in the closed position cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> bears against the closed cam surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. In this position the downward force of water acting on the upper surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is sufficient to overcome any buoyant forces acting on the float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> so that the hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is held in a downwardly pivoted position. The half flush and full flush cam surfaces <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> will be described in more detail in relation to later figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, this figure illustrates the configuration of the apparatus when a half flush has been initiated by the user and the water level in the cistern is reducing from a full level to above the selected half flush level. The half flush position is initiated by the user depressing the half flush button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the half flush button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is depressed fully it presses upon the push rod <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which travels distance A and causes cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to raise float seal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> distance B. in the process of moving cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the half flush position, cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> ceases to beer upon the closed cam surface <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is able to pivot by virtue of the buoyant forces acting on float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> until half flush cam surface <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> comes into contact with cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The transition from the closed position to the half flush position will generally take only a fraction of a second, being the time it takes for a user to fully depress the half flush button <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The half flush button will then react to its normal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Once in the half flush position, water will evacuate from the cistern through the outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as the seal between the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the annular outlet rim <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> will have been broken. Accordingly, the level of water in the cistern will begin to drop. The outflow of water around the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and out of the outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> will result in a net downward force acting on the upper surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> such that it is urged towards the closed position. The downward forces may be made up of the mass of water above the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> acting downwardly on the upper surfaces <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of those components. Additionally it is considered that there will also be a significant venturi effect caused by flow of water out of the outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> resulting in a reduced pressure on the underside <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. This added to the other downward forces will urge the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> towards the closed position. In the half flush position however, the half flush cam surface <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The shape of the half flush cam surface <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> is such that when the hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is biased upwardly by float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> said surface engages with the cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> so as to prevent movement of the cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> towards the closed position. In other words the half flush cam surface <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> provides a temporary lock against which the cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> acts and is prevented from moving past. The locking action is sufficient to resist the downward acting forces on the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and float seal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as long as there is an upward force acting on the hinged stop by virtue of the float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> being immersed in water. Accordingly the locking action of the hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will remain to hold the cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and float seal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the half flush position until such time as the water level drops in the cistern to a point where the float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is no longer immersed in water. As described above, position of the float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be selected by moving it up or down along track <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. Therefore by selecting an appropriate position for the float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the track <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, this dictates the level at which the hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> ceases to provide the half flush locking function and thus the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> will close to prevent further flow of water out of the cistern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> When the water level has dropped to a point where the float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> no longer provides an upward force on the hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> will pivot back to the downwardly pivoted position, the same as when the apparatus is in the closed position. The half flush cam surface <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> will therefore move back away from the cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> allowing the cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to move to the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the apparatus in the full flush position. This position is adopted when the user depresses the full flush button <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The full flush button <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> moves push rod <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> distance C, which is greater than distance A. This causes cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to raise float seal <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> distance D. It can be seen that in the process of moving cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> into the full flush position, cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> moves past the half flush position until it bears on full flush cam surface <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. Again the transition from the closed position to the full flush position will generally only take a fraction of a second, being the time it takes for a user to fully depress the full flush button <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Full flush button then retracts to its normal position. The speed of actuation is such that half flush cam surface <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> of the hinged stop <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> does not have time to engage the cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> as the cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is moved from the closed position through the half flush position to the full flush position. The cam follower <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> may abut the full flush cam surface <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> although the action between this surface and the cam <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is not critical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When in the full flush position, water will evacuate from the cistern through the outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as the seal between the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the annular outlet rim <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> will have been broken. The level of water in the cistern will drop. In the full flush position, although water will be flowing around the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> will be positioned such a distance away from the any venturi effect described above such that there is little if any such downward force acting upon it. Further, float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will have an upwardly acting buoyancy force acting upon its surface because float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will be surrounded with water, unlike the situation in the half flush position. The net forces acting on the cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the full flush position while the water level is above the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> will cause it to remain in that position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As the water level drops to a point where the float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> no longer provides a dominant upward force, which will generally be when the water level has dropped to the position of the float <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the downward forces acting on the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> will cause the cantilever arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to move to the closed position. At such a point, a full flush volume of water will have been discharged from the cistern. Water trapped in the recesses <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the seal end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> will provide a mass to assist in moving the apparatus to the closed position. As the water level rises to fill the cistern in preparation for a future flush the mounting downward forces acting on the sealing gasket <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> will hold it in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The apparatus may be made from any suitable materials by any suitable means. For example, various components of the apparatus may be made by injection moulding of polymeric materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that various modifications, additions and or alterations may be made to the apparatus previously described without departing from the spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
