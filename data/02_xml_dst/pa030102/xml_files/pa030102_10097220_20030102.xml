<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to articles of clothing for an infant and, in particular, to clothing designed to provide additional traction for a crawling and/or walking infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Socks are one type of infant clothing. Dressing an infant with fabric socks is advantageous in many ways. Socks are aesthetically pleasing, keep the infant&apos;s feet warm and protect the infant&apos;s feet from minor cuts and abrasions. When the infant becomes ambulatory, however, socks can be disadvantageous on smooth floor surfaces, such as hardwood or linoleum floors, because there is a very low coefficient of friction between fabric material of the socks and the floor surface. This poses an increased risk of injury because the infant may slip and fall on the smooth surface while wearing only the fabric socks. Dressing the infant with shoes is one solution to this problem, but it is not always desirable, and is often difficult, to put shoes on an ambulatory infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This is a recognized problem, and many prior art infants socks, therefore, have been fitted with material that provides greater traction on the bottom of the sock. This material is also referred to as a gripper area. These prior art socks have worked well for those infants who have already progressed to walking, because the portion of the sock with the gripper area is in contact with the smooth floor surface. These prior art socks, however, have been disadvantageous for crawling infants, because typically the feet of crawling infants contact the floor surface with portion of the foot closest to the toes or the top of the foot, rather than the bottom of the foot. Because the top portion of the prior art socks did not contain a gripper area on the toes or top of the sock, the same problems were encountered as with socks without any gripper area, which results in an increased risk of injury to crawling infants wearing the prior art socks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to provide an article of infant clothing that will provide greater traction for crawling infants as well as for infants that are already walking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It also is desirable to provide infant apparel that will protect the knees and elbows of crawling infants as well infants that are already walking. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns infant apparel for use with a crawling and/or walking infant. For example, one article of infant apparel is a sock member with an upper surface, a lower surface, and a toe portion connecting and enclosing the upper and lower surfaces at a leading edge of the sock member. A traction device in the form of a gripper area is attached to the exterior portion of the sock member and preferably extends from the upper surface to the toe area and further to the lower surface. The gripper area is preferably a frictional material that has a greater coefficient of friction than the material forming the sock member. The sock member can be tubular or foot-shaped for ease of dressing the infant. Alternatively, the gripper area is formed in a tread pattern and can include transversely or circumferentially spaced ribs along the upper surface, toe portion, and lower surface. In either sock shape, the gripper area can extend to a side area of the sock to aid a crawling infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention recognizes that prior art socks were suitable neither for providing traction to crawling infants nor for reducing the risk of injury to crawling infants on smooth floor surfaces. With a gripper area at the top surface and toe portion of the sock member, the sock provides infants a greater ability to crawl on smooth surfaces, while reducing the risk of injury to the crawling infants. The present invention is also suitable for infants who have progressed to walking, because the gripper area extends to the lower surface of the sock member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition to socks, articles of clothing such as jumpers and pants can have the traction devices on both the feet and knee portions. Furthermore, pads can be provided in the knee portions to protect the infant&apos;s knees during crawling or in case of a fall during walking. The pads can be positioned on either the exterior or the interior of the material forming the article of clothing. The feet portions also can be detachable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a novel improvement over the prior art because while the prior art teaches many different varieties of infant socks, none of the prior art teaches an infant sock or foot portion with a gripper area extending to the toe, the side area and the upper surface of the sock member for the purpose of providing traction to crawling infants.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an article of infant apparel or clothing such as an infant sock is shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The infant sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a generally tubular sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having an exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, an exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an exterior toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the exterior thereof. The toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> defines an enclosed end of the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> opposite an open end for receiving an infant&apos;s foot (not shown). The sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed of a natural fabric material, such as cotton, or a synthetic fabric material, such as nylon or spandex, or a combination of such materials. Preferably the infant sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is latex free. The upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably consist of the same amount of fabric material so as to ensure a good fit on an infant&apos;s foot (not shown.) The infant sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably sized to fit an infant learning to crawl. A typical age for such an infant is about four months of age to about one year of age. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A traction device in the form of a gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adhered to the exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the exterior toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> covers a continuous area of the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including a lower portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending partially along the exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a toe portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extending along the exterior toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a top portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>extending partially along the exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The area covered by the gripper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably greater than the area covered by the gripper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably covers most, if not all, of the area of the exterior toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> covers a greater area on the exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> than on the exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Also, the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can extend along a side area where the surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> meet forming a side portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>The gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed of a material that increases the coefficient of friction with a floor surface, such as a rubberized material or the like, having a coefficient of friction greater than a coefficient of friction of the material from which the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is made. The material of the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is flexible and withstands laundering. The material of the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be adhered to the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a thermal process, such as an applique process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When crawling, an infant&apos;s feet are positioned upside down such that the toe portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>come into contact with the floor surface providing traction. Often, the infant will turn his/her toes in or out causing the side portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to contact the floor surface providing traction. When walking, the lower portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>contacts the floor surface providing traction. Thus, whether crawling or walking, the traction device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> aids the mobility of the infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> also includes an annular elastic band <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attached to the upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that forms the open end for receiving the infant&apos;s foot. The elastic band <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also aids in keeping the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in place on the infant&apos;s lower leg (not shown.) The elastic band <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> preferably includes a fabric sheath for comfort. A tubular entrance band <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is attached to the elastic band <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The entrance band <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed of the same material as the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and may include a typical knitting pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The knitting pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> preferably consists of multiple parallel ribs of knitted fabric that may be folded towards the toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as desired for aesthetic purposes. The sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> also includes an emblem or similar indicia <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The emblem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed of the same material as the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the emblem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is attached to the upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or to the entrance band <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an alternative embodiment of an infant sock is shown generally at <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>.
