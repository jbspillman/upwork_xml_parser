<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an evaluation system for evaluating a staff member for stocking articles. At a department store and a volume-sales shop, stocking of the articles, which is so-called &ldquo;preparations of articles&rdquo;, is quite important work that affects the business. This work is normally performed by staff known as buyers or distributors (who may be called shop salesclerks in some cases). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> What has hitherto been a general system for evaluating such a work is based on a sales volume and a profit of the articles sold. Then, the evaluation based on the articles sold does not account for a situation in which the article could not be sold though it would be sold in usual state. This is because the information on the article sold is easy to obtain, but the information on the article that was not sold is hard to obtain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Further, the information indicating a loss of sales chance such as &ldquo;this article would be sold if stocked&rdquo; does not simply raise a problem that the sales volume is short, but gives such a risky signal that the customer&apos;s trust might be lost on occasions or the customer might fleet to other retail shops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the buyer with a small quantity of losses of sales chance must be evaluated high, while the buyer with a large quantity of losses of sales chance must be evaluated low. According to the prior art, however, the evaluation is based on the articles sold, and therefore an achievement of the staff member such as the buyer etc was not necessarily evaluated in precision. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is a primary object of the present invention, which as devised to obviate the problems inherent in the prior art, to provide a technology capable of accurately evaluating the staff such as buyers etc by grasping a state of a loss of sales chance of an article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, an article staff evaluation system comprises a module (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) recording article information on an article, a unit (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) inputting occurrence information indicating an occurrence of a loss of sales chance of the article, and a unit (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) evaluating a article staff in charge of a trade of the article on the basis of the occurrence information and attributes of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Herein, the occurrence of the loss of sales chance implies that when there is, for example, an offer of purchasing the article at a retail shop of the article, there is no stock of this article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the article information may contain a sales price of the article, and the evaluation unit (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may evaluate the article staff in a way that reflects the sales price of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the article information may contain information indicating a continuity of a sales frequency of the article, and the evaluation unit (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may evaluate the article staff in a way that reflects the continuity of the sales frequency of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Herein, the article having the continuity of the sales frequency is, e.g., a so-called standard article that is sold continuously. Further, the article having no continuity of the sales frequency is an article of which a sales quantity and a sales count are largely fluctuate depending on, e.g., trends and seasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the article information may contain information indicating a retail presentation term of the article, the occurrence information may contain an occurrence date of the loss of sales chance, and the evaluation unit (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may evaluate the article staff in a way that reflects a relationship between the occurrence date and the retail presentation term. Herein, the retail presentation term is a term for which the article is put on sale at retail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the article staff evaluation system may further comprise a module (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) referring to information on a state of inventory of a supplier of the article, and the evaluation unit (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may evaluate the article staff in a way that reflects the state of inventory of the supplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the article staff evaluation system may further comprise a module (<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) referring to information on a state of inventory of the article in a competitor, and the evaluation unit (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) may evaluate the article staff in a way that reflects the state of inventory of the competitor. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">System Architecture </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the system architecture of the information processing system in this embodiment. This information processing system is configured by a POS (Point Of Sales) terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or a personal computer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (that will hereinafter be abbreviated to PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) installed in a retail shop, and a server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> installed in a head office. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used for inputting pieces of loss-of-sales-chance information. A loss of sales chance means that when a customer offers a purchase of a commercial article, there is no stock of this article in the retail shop, and the shop was unable to sell this article. In such a case, a staff worker at this retail shop inputs a piece of information indicating that the loss of sales chance occurs (which is called the loss-of-sales-chance information) on the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the case of inputting the same information on the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the staff worker at the retail shop searches for the article with no stock from an article management book. In the article management book, the respective articles are bar-coded with JAN (Japan Article Number) codes. The staff worker inputs, from a bar code reader of the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a bar code of the article of which the sales chance was lost, and transmits this bar code to the server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when inputting the above information on the PC <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the staff worker at the retail shop accesses the server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the PC <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and searches the databases of the server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the basis of a name of the article with no stock.

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The loss-of-sales-chance article code&rdquo; filed is registered with a JAN code of the loss-of-sales-chance target article. This JAN code is, as touched in the discussion in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, read from among the bar codes of the article management book or from the article master database <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and is entered in the loss-of-sales-chance information database <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;in-charge salesclerk code&rdquo; field and the &ldquo;in-charge salesclerk name&rdquo; field are registered with a code and a name that identify the salesclerk serving the customer when the loss of sales chance occurred. The code and the name of every salesclerk are preset on the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Then, when every salesclerk uses the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the salesclerk code of the salesclerk himself or herself is authenticated as an operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the salesclerk inputs the loss of sales chance the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> enters the now-authenticated salesclerk code and name in the loss-of-sales-chance information database <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;customer code&rdquo; field is registered with a customer code set by the sales clerk when the customer concerned is identified with a member who registered the customer code in the present information processing system. This setting is done by use of, e.g., a magnetic card or an IC card distributed to the registered customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is the diagram showing the data structure of the article master database <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Each line in the table in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> corresponds to one record in the article master database <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Each record consists of pieces of data about one single article, which are recorded in respective fields. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each record in the article master base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> consists of data entered in a &ldquo;JAN code&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;model number&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;color&rdquo; filed, a &ldquo;size&rdquo; field, an &ldquo;item&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;sales price&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;cost price&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;brand code&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;brand name&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;fashionability degree&rdquo; field and an &ldquo;article presentation term&rdquo; field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;JAN code&rdquo; is a number for uniquely identifying the article concerned. The JAN codes are defined as common article codes in Japan but are compatible with the international common article codes. The present information processing system involves the use of the JAN codes as article identifying codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;model number&rdquo; is an article model number set by the article provider (the maker or wholesaler). Further, the &ldquo;color&rdquo; and the &ldquo;size&rdquo; are a color and a size of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;item&rdquo; field is registered with information on an article category such as a fashion ring, a shirt, a one-piece and so on. The &ldquo;sales price&rdquo; and the &ldquo;cost price&rdquo; are a sales price and a purchase price of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;brand code&rdquo; and the &ldquo;brand name&rdquo; are a code and a name that identify the brand of the article. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;fashionability degree&rdquo; may be defined as data indicating how much the article is fashionable. According to the present information processing system, the fashionability degree is set lower as the article exhibits a higher popularity and a larger fluctuation in sales quantity. Further, this fashionability degree is set higher as the article exhibits a less fluctuation in sales quantity and a longer continuity of the sales chance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The present information processing system evaluates how much the sales chance is lost based on the fashionability degree. For example, the present information processing system judges that the responsibility of the buyer is not heavy even if the loss of the sales chance occurs with respect to the article exhibiting the large fluctuation in sales quantity. While on the other hand, it is judged that the responsibility of the buyer is heavier when the loss of the sales chance occurs with respect to the article exhibiting a smaller fluctuation in sales quantity and a longer continuity of the sales chance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;article presentation term&rdquo; is a term for which the article concerned is presented at retail. The article master database <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> retains pieces of data with respect to a plurality of presentation terms 1 through 5 into which the article presentation term is further divided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The present information processing system evaluates the degree of the loss of sales chance in terms of a relationship between the date when the loss of sales chance occurs and the presentation term of the article. For example, even if the loss of sales chance occurs at the end of the presentation term, the responsibility of the buyer is judged light. By contrast, if the loss of sales chance occurs at the beginning of the presentation term, the responsibility of the buyer is judged heavy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the data structure of the buyer master database <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Each line in the table shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> corresponds to one record in the buyer master database <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, each record consists of pieces of data about one single buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each record in the buyer master database <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> consists of data entered in a &ldquo;buyer code&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;buyer name&rdquo; field, an &ldquo;in-charge division code&rdquo; field, an &ldquo;in-charge supplier code&rdquo; field, an &ldquo;in-charge brand code&rdquo; field and an &ldquo;in-charge brand name&rdquo; field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;buyer code&rdquo; is a code for uniquely identifying each buyer. The &ldquo;buyer name&rdquo; is a name of the buyer. The &ldquo;in-charge division code&rdquo; and the &ldquo;in-charge supplier code&rdquo; are codes indicating a division and a supplier which the buyer takes charge of. The &ldquo;in-charge brand code&rdquo; and the &ldquo;in-charge brand name&rdquo; are codes specifying a brand and a name of this brand which the buyer takes charge of. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the presentation term degree file. This presentation term degree file is contained in the evaluation information database <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This presentation term degree file is stored with an evaluation degree (which may be called a presentation term degree) when the loss of sales chance occurs in each of the presentation terms 1 through 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, according to this embodiment, &ldquo;5&rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo;m &ldquo;3&rdquo;, &ldquo;2&rdquo;, &ldquo;1&rdquo; are set as the presentation term degrees in the presentation terms 1 through 5. This implies that the responsibility of the buyer becomes heavier as it is closer to the beginning of the article presentation term. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> While on the other hand, after the article presentation term has expired, &ldquo;0&rdquo; is set as the presentation term degree, which means that the buyer is not called to take the responsibility. Further, the presentation term degree &ldquo;5&rdquo; is set for articles requiring no presentation term, i.e., the articles that should be prepared at all times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the data structure of the supplier inventory factor file. This supplier inventory factor file is also contained in the evaluation information database <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The supplier inventory factor file is utilized for reflecting information on whether the supplier had a stock when the loss of sales chance occurred, in evaluating the buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, when having the stock, the supplier inventory factor is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and when having no stock, the factor is set to &ldquo;0.5&rdquo;. It can be therefore comprehended that the responsibility of the buyer is relieved (the degree is 0.5) even if the loss of sales chance occurs when the supplier has no stock. By contrast, it can be understood that the supplier has the stock, and, nevertheless, if the loss of sales chance occurs, the responsibility of the buyer is not relieved (the degree is 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Note that the information on whether the suppliers having given their consent to provide the information about their own inventories have the stocks, is obtained via a network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the data structure of the competitor inventory factor file. This competitor inventory factor file is likewise contained in the evaluation information database <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, when having the stock, the factor is set to &ldquo;3&rdquo;, and when having no stock, the factor is set to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. It can be therefore comprehended that the competitor has the stock, and, nevertheless, if the loss of sales chance occurs, the responsibility of the buyer is called to take a weighted responsibility (the degree is 3). By contrast, it can be understood that even if the loss of sales chance occurs when the trader has no stock, the responsibility of the buyer is not weighted (the degree is 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the data structure of a loss-of-chance detailed file. This loss-of-chance detailed file is also contained in the evaluation information database <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The loss-of-chance detailed file is utilized as an operation-oriented intermediate data area for evaluating the buyer on the basis of the loss-of-sales-chance information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the loss-of-chance detailed file has a &ldquo;detailed record No.&rdquo; field, an &ldquo;occurrence date&rdquo; field, an &ldquo;occurrence shop code&rdquo;, field, an &ldquo;occurrence shop name&rdquo;, field, an &ldquo;occurrence sales counter code&rdquo; field, an &ldquo;occurrence sales counter name&rdquo; field, an &ldquo;article code&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;minus point&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;fashionability degree&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;presentation term degree&rdquo; field , a &ldquo;supplier inventory factor&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;competitor inventory factor&rdquo; field, a &ldquo;brand code&rdquo; field and a &ldquo;buyer code&rdquo; field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;occurrence date&rdquo;, the &ldquo;occurrence shop code&rdquo;, the &ldquo;occurrence shop name&rdquo;, the &ldquo;occurrence sales counter code&rdquo; and the &ldquo;occurrence sales counter name&rdquo; among those items, are the same data as those described in the loss-of-sales-chance information database. Further, the &ldquo;article code&rdquo; is the same as the loss-of-sales-chance article code in the loss-of-sales-chance information database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Further, the &ldquo;fashionability degree&rdquo;, the &ldquo;brand code&rdquo; and the &ldquo;buyer code&rdquo; are the same data as those specified in the article master database <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the &ldquo;presentation term degree&rdquo;, the &ldquo;supplier inventory factor&rdquo; and &ldquo;competitor inventory factor&rdquo; are the degree and factors determined in a presentation term degree file, a supplier inventory factor file and a competitor inventory factor file, depending on a date when the loss-of-sales-chance occurs, a state of the supplier inventory, and a state of the competitor inventory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the &ldquo;detailed record No.&rdquo; is a unique number for identifying each record in the loss-of-chance detailed file. Further, the &ldquo;minus point&rdquo; is defined as a buyer evaluation point determined from the sales price in the article master database <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the fashionability degree, the presentation term degree, the supplier inventory factor and the competitor inventory factor. This evaluation point, however, indicates an evaluation based on the loss of sales chance and a minus point representing a point deducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The present information system evaluates each buyer on the basis of this loss-of-chance detailed file. Then, the evaluated results are gathered and outputted to the Terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or the printer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> If unable to obtain the information on whether the supplier has the stock or whether the competitor has the stock, however, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is set in the corresponding factor, i.e., the supplier inventory factor or the competitor inventory factor. A process of calculating the option evaluation is called an option process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a layout of the degree setting screen. This degree setting screen is displayed on the Terminal <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and is used for the administrator of the information system to set the variety of degrees and factors in the formula 1. This degree setting screen contains, from an upper area on the screen, a fashionability degree setting window <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, a presentation term degree setting window <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, a supplier inventory factor setting window <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, a competitor inventory factor setting window <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and a sales chance loss count factor setting window <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A fashionability degree is set in the fashionability degree setting window <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. This fashionability degree is specified corresponding to a degree of how much the sales quantity of the article changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In an example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> degree &ldquo;1&rdquo; is set for a fashion article such as lady&apos;s wear etc sold out at a short cycle.

<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, according to the present information processing system, the buyer can be objectively evaluated based on the state where the loss of sales chance occurs. In the present information processing system, on the occasion of evaluating the buyer, the characteristics of the target article stored in the article master database <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are referred to. The evaluation reflecting the sales price and the demand of the target article, the degree of change in the sales quantity and the time within the retail presentation term, can be thereby performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Further, the present information processing system involves obtaining as much information on the inventories of the suppliers and the competitors as possible. Then, the evaluation of the buyer reflects the states of how much and whether or not the suppliers and the competitors have the stocks when the loss of sales chance occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> With this contrivance, the responsibility of the buyer is set heavy when the supplier has the stock and set light when having no stock, thus evaluating the buyer. Further, the responsibility of the buyer is set heavier when the competitor has the stock and set lighter when having no stock, thus evaluating the buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The information on the article sold out has hitherto been easy to obtain, while the information on the article unsold has hitherto been hard to obtain. According to the present invention processing system, however, pieces of information such as &ldquo;this article would be sold if stocked&rdquo; are systematically collected. Therefore, the present information processing system has such an effect that it is possible not only to simply prevent a decrease in sales volume but also to grasp the situations where the customer&apos;s trust might be lost and the regular customers might fleet to other competitors (shops). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Then, the present information processing system has the scheme that the evaluation of the buyer with a less loss of sales chance is enhanced, while the evaluation of the buyer with a greater loss of sales chance is degraded. With this scheme, the objectivity of the buyer evaluation increases to stimulate a buyer&apos;s enthusiasm about the work, whereby the business efficiency rises. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Modified Example </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The information processing system in the present embodiment is configured by the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> installed at the counter of the shop, and the server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for managing the plurality of shops in concentration. The embodiment of the present invention is not, however, limited to this system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> For example, a shop server ranked between the server <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> etc may be provided at every shop. The shop server may manage pieces of information peculiar to the shop concerned such as a shop code, a shop name, a sales counter code and a name of the sales counter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In such a case, unlike the embodiment discussed above, there is no necessity of presetting the shop code, the shop name, the sales counter code and the name of the sales counter on the POS terminal <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or the PC<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The shop server at every shop may manage those items of data batchwise. Then, when the loss of sales chance occurs, the POS terminal or the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may inquire of the shop server about those items of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment discussed above, the minus point is calculated each time the loss of sales chance occurs, and the minus points are gathered monthly. The embodiment of the present invention is not, however, limited to this procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> For example, whenever the loss of sales chance occurs, the loss-of-sales-chance information of every article is accumulated and gathered at an interval of a predetermined period, and, after collecting these pieces of information, the minus points may be calculated. That is, normally, the loss-of-sales-chance information may be accumulated and gathered for the evaluation at the interval of the predetermined period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> According to the embodiment discussed above, the minus points are collected monthly. The embodiment of the present invention is not, however, confined to this procedure. The above interval of the collection period may be properly set corresponding to the system user. For instance, the information may be gathered every week, every ten days, at an interval of a plurality of months, every season, semi annually and annually. </paragraph>

Accordingly, the data communication signal embodied in the carrier wave may be any one of a modulated broadband signal and an unmodulated base band signal (corresponding to a case of setting a DC signal having a voltage of 0 as a carrier wave). </paragraph>
