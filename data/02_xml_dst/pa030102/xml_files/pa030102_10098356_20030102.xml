<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a mounting structure and a method for mounting and holding a card-type electronic device in a predetermined position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Modern electronic apparatuses, such as personal computers, use various electronic devices for expansion, storage, etc. A card-type hard disc drive (hereinafter referred to as HDD) for use as one such electronic device is screwed directly or indirectly to a seating portion within the case of a personal computer by utilizing tapped holes in the base of the HDD. Alternatively, the HDD is fixed by means of a fixing member that is screwed to the case. In either case, vibrational shock that acts on the HDD can be reduced by placing a cushioning member of an elastic material between the HDD and the seating portion of the case or between the HDD and the fixing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Usually, the cushioning member includes a plurality of cushioning members that are arranged at the four corners of the HDD, on its upper and lower surfaces, and near screw junctions. In mounting the HDD on the case side, therefore, the cushioning members must be located between the HDD and the case or between the HDD and the fixing member. Thus, mounting or removing the HDD is troublesome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the case where the HDD is not fixed directly to the seating portion side, as in the case of an ultra-compact HDD, it can be easily mounted and removed from the case side of the personal computer. On the other hand, in this case, adequate protection can not be provided for the HDD against external vibration. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been contrived in consideration of these circumstances, and its object is to provide a mounting structure and a method for mounting a card-type electronic device, in which the electronic device can be attached and detached with ease and protected against external vibrational shock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the above object, a mounting structure according to an aspect of the present invention is used to mount and hold the card-type electronic device having a connector on one side edge portion thereof. The mounting structure comprises: a cushioning member formed of an elastic material, detachably attached to the card-type electronic device so as to cover at least the four corner portions of the electronic device, and having a thickness greater than that of the electronic device; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> a seating portion having a seating surface opposed to a surface of the card-type electronic device; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> a retaining member opposed to the seating surface and clamping the cushioning member on the card-type electronic device between the seating surface and the retaining member to hold the electronic device in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, a mounting method for a card-type electronic device according to another aspect of the invention comprises: detachably attaching cushioning member, having a thickness greater than that of the card-type electronic device and formed of an elastic material, to the electronic device and covering at least the four corner portions of the electronic device; opposing the card-type electronic device having the cushioning member thereon to a seating surface of a seating portion; and opposing a retaining member to the seating surface and clamping the cushioning member between the retaining member and the seating surface to hold the card-type electronic device on the seating portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to the mounting structure and mounting method for a card-type electronic device arranged in this manner, a card-type electronic device can be attached to and detached from the seating portion in a manner such that the detachable cushioning member is attached to the peripheral edge portion of the electronic device. In installing or removing the card-type electronic device, therefore, neither of the cushioning members need be permanently fixed to the seating portion, enabling the card-type electronic device to be installed or removed with ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Further, the card-type electronic device is fixed by means of the cushioning member that is held between the seating portion and the retaining member. If vibrational shock acts on the seating portion, therefore, the cushioning effect of the cushioning member can reduce the shock to the electronic device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the card-type electronic device can be securely fixed in a predetermined position by means of the cushioning member. The shock-absorbing properties of the cushioning member, which is formed of an elastic material such as rubber, can prevent the electronic device from being dislocated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A personal computer that is furnished with a mounting structure for a card-type electronic device according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An HDD for use as the card-type electronic device will be described first. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in the form of a flat, substantially rectangular card with a thickness of 5.0 mm. The HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed of a rectangular metal plate, a platelike top cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that covers the upper surface of the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provided on the bottom side of the base, and a bottom cover <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that covers the bottom side of the printed circuit board and the base. These elements are stacked in layers to form a card-type structure as a whole. A frame-shaped seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for airtightly-sealing the inside of the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is interposed between the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the top cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are provided a 1.8-inch magnetic disc <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that serves as an information recording medium, a spindle motor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for use as a drive motor for supporting and rotating the magnetic disc, and a plurality of magnetic heads for writing to/reading information from the magnetic disc. On the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are further provided a head actuator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that supports the magnetic heads for movement with respect to the magnetic disc <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a voice coil motor (not shown) for rocking and positioning the head actuator, a ramped loading mechanism, an inertia latch mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a substrate unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a head IC or the like, an air filter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The printed circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is provided on the outer surface of the bottom wall of the base <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, is mounted with a connector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is connected to the substrate unit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for connecting the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to an external apparatus. The connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> projects from one side edge of the HDD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, a personal computer is furnished with the mounting structure for mounting and holding the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the personal computer comprises a seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a part of the case. The seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a flat seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Four L-shaped positioning projections <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> protrude from the seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The projections <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are located so as to position the four corner portions of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A main printed circuit board (hereinafter referred to as main PCB) <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is provided in the case of the personal computer so as to adjoin and face the seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A seating-side connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is mounted on the main PCB <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> so as to face the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Further, the mounting structure comprises first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that are detachably attached to the peripheral edge portion of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed of an elastic material such as rubber. The thickness of each cushioning member is greater than the thickest portion of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are of the same shape and are substantially U-shaped, to match the shape of the longitudinally opposite end edge portions of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, the cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be attached to the HDD to cover its four corner portions and the longitudinally opposite end edge portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Each of the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has an aperture corresponding to the connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the first cushioning member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be attached to either end edge portion of the HDD such that the connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is exposed through the aperture <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further, the mounting structure comprises a trunk connector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, which connects the connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the seating-side connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and a retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (mentioned later). The trunk connector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes a first connector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected to the seating-side connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a second connector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connected to the connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the aperture <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the first cushioning member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and a flexible printed circuit board (hereinafter referred to as FPC) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that connects the first and second connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In mounting the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the personal computer, the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are first attached to the longitudinally opposite end edge portions of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. Subsequently, the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed on the seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so as to be aligned with the positioning projections <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the first connector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the trunk connector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is connected to the seating-side connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, while the second connector <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected to the connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the aperture <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the first cushioning member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Thereupon, the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is located in a predetermined position on the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and is connected electrically to the main PCB <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by means of the trunk connector <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the seating-side connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, the first cushioning member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has the aperture <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> through which the connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is exposed, so that the connector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the personal computer can be connected and disconnected without disengaging the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Since the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>have the same shape, moreover, they may be interchange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Then, the retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, in the form of a plate, is located over the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The case of the personal computer can be used as the retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, for example. Further, the retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a plurality of bosses <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that project toward the seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and surround the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It is to be desired that the height of each boss <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is greater than the thickness of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and less than the thickness of each of the cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is secured to the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by means of a plurality of screws <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and the bosses <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are therefore brought into contact with the seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Thereupon, the retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is opposed parallel to the seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at a given distance therefrom and attached to the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that are thicker than the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are held and fixed between the retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Thus, the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is mounted on the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by means of the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Although the seating surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are intimately in contact with the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in this mounted state, they can never be directly in contact with the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to this mounting structure and mounting method arranged in this manner, the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be attached to and detached from the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the personal computer with the first and second detachable cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are attached to the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In installing or removing the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, therefore, neither of the cushioning members need be permanently fixed to the seating portion, enabling the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be installed or removed with ease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Further, the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fixed by means of the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that are held between the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the retaining member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. If vibrational shock acts on the seating portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, therefore, the cushioning effect of the cushioning members can reduce the shock to the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In consequence, the HDD can be better protected from damage. Since the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are mounted so as to surround the peripheral edge portion of the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, moreover, they can produce a high cushioning effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the HDD <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be securely fixed in the predetermined position by means of the first and second cushioning members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The shock-absorbing properties of the cushioning members, which are formed of an elastic material such as rubber, can restrain the HDD from being dislocated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there can be provided a mounting structure and a method of mounting a card-type electronic device, in which the electronic device can be attached and detached with ease and protected against external vibrational shock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
