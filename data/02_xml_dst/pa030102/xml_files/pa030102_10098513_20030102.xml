<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Development in the teaching and learning educational field has progressed very slowly. Pupils are still taught in traditional ways, to a very large extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Firstly, it is difficult to obtain an overall picture of existing educational processes and what they involve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Secondly, there is at present no way of ensuring the quality of education/competence development. How shall the interface/interactivity and quality between pupils and teachers be ensured, regardless of whether the educational process/competence development takes place online or offline&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Document U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,865 describes a pedagogic instrument which creates the possibility of creating a given degree of interactivity between pupil and teacher on the basis of a defined teaching plan. The educational process or section of the course taken is aided and supported by sound and pictures, for example. This document deals solely with the teaching section in the absence of logic. On the other hand, the document fails to touch upon the full competence development process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Document U.S. Pat. No. 6,157,808 describes a so-called Teacher&apos;s Platform, where the object has been to create different modules within the area of competence development with the intention of creating a communicative forum. There is no well-reasoned logic that supports the so-called competence development process, but that the functions, figuratively speaking, constitute a leaf diagram in which the individual leaves are described in the document as modules, in the absence of any coherent logic process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The document U.S. Pat. No. 6,157,808 includes essentially a conceived content of so-called commercially established certificates. In principle, the function provides a possibility of creating a so-called gap analysis concerning the competence of an employee in relation to certificate requirements. This concerns primarily a so-called Human Resource tool which enables a company to keep track of the employee&apos;s competence. </paragraph>

The individual automatically receives an own digital CV or logbook for immediate access and communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The distributed computer network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be the Internet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or a Wide Area Network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>(WAN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the inventive control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the first memory devices <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the third memory devices <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the fourth memory devices <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are comprised of a second server (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> According to one preferred embodiment of the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, each computer device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>includes a reproduction device or display (not shown), wherein different cursors are presented on the display to indicate different statuses of an individual&apos;s course section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a first cursor indicates that a course section is complete, a second cursor indicates that a course section is ongoing, and a third cursor indicates that a course section has been commenced but not yet completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The various cursors may be comprised of different icons, which may be of mutually different colours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to one preferred embodiment of the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a fourth cursor is used to start and stop registration of the time spent in respect of a course section the recording device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to one preferred embodiment of the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an individual is able to communicate with a teacher in writing, by means of a fifth cursor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The aforedescribed control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also enables the management of resource bookings and economy accounts within the competence development sector in the form of, e.g., personnel, localities, educational material, equipment, courses, occupied/unoccupied times, quotations, tenders, invoicing accounts, and so on. This synergy creates conditions for making the competence development sector more efficient, this sector being at present very traditional, where duplication, the poor use of resources, and difficulties in follow-ups are more of a rule than an exception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The inventive control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is able to develop the value chain in the education sector, where a separate individual can be coupled to the entire chain by education suppliers, product suppliers, and branch organisations. In the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, all interested parties/suppliers constitute the described components/modules that can be readily transferred to an individual competence development plan. For instance, a specific trade union is able to link in its own information document sandwiched with external educational material and use the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for keeping touch with and following-up the competence development of all members, and to ensure that the information has reached its destination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The inventive control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is devised for use generally within the entire educational field, regardless of professional field, competence field, subject content or language. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enables an individual to obtain access to material that may lie in different databases anywhere in the world, via links. This is made possible when the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Content development and revision is made more efficient, by virtue of the fact that the memory devices of the control system are reached simultaneously from several entities responsible for development/quality, regardless of time and space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> It is possible by means of the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to fetch information that indicates when a person needs to supplement, e.g., a certificate, either because the time is about to expire/has expired, or because a grade needs to be raised in respect of a section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Presence/time reports concerning competence development can be readily fetched from the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and distributed when, for instance, a company desires continuous reports. Alternatively, the reports may be fetched personally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also enables a search to be made for persons that have a specific competence, e.g. persons that have a competence within 3D CAD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Because the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adapted to a web solution, it is possible, in principle, for an individual to pay a fee for access to study material that has been pre-packed in a quality-ensured fashion. This is important, since the development moves towards the individual himself/herself governing his/her own competence development. In Sweden, the political parties are agreed on so-called competence accounts, and Skandia has already introduced competence insurance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A quality manual that describes precisely how the competence development process is achieved, can be created in a quality-ensured fashion with the use of the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> makes it possible to co-operate with several content suppliers who are able to supply complete courses or individual modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> enables a time and a price to be set for each module included. This means that when the individual competence development plan has been completed, the price for the whole of the delivery will also have been paid-up. Additional costs can be readily billed if the time is exceeded. Alternatively, it may be necessary for the individual to place a new order. With regard to the competence account of an individual, a statement can be given as to the amount of money used in the account and the amount of money remaining in said account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> It will be obvious that the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include the function of communicating with the teacher via sound and/or pictures (images), for instance via voice mail or a video conference, either online or offline. Moreover, the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can also be used in a so-called traditional classroom scenario as a strong support for the teacher, who will function more as a coach and supervisor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also enables the establishment or supplementation of company-specific targets and course sections that may be related to set knowledge proficiency or production targets, which are then broken down to an individual level where a team may be deliberately given different competence development plans which lead towards the company targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The web solution will make the control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> available via many different media, e.g. so-called thin clients, which do not possess their own intelligence but where a common server solution supplies all contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may also provide quick and correct reports, for example reports relating to time, presence (attendance), educational status, preliminary calculations (estimates), costing, deviations and economy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating a method of achieving quality ensured competence development in accordance with the present invention. The method starts at block <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with the step of selecting a course section from a first memory device which is included in the control system and which is operable to store all sections of different courses and also an ideal time taken to complete each course section, wherein the course sections chosen form an individual-adapted course plan which is stored in a third memory device in the control system. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with the step in which study material affiliated with the chosen course section from a second memory device included in the control system and operable in storing all study material. The method is then continued at block <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with the step of calculating and indicating a planned completion date for said course plan with the aid of a control device included in the system and with the aid of said ideal time for different course sections and the time spent by the individual for each course section. In block <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, there is asked the question as to whether one or more course sections or a course plan has/have been completed. If the response to this question is negative, the step according to block <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is repeated. If the answer to the question is positive, the method continues at block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in which the completed course section and/or course sections is/are stored in a fourth memory device included in the control system. The method is terminated at block <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> According to one preferred embodiment of the inventive method, each individual obtains access to the control system through the medium of a computer device which can be connected to a distributed computer network and which includes a reproduction device or display. The method also includes the steps in which </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> a first cursor is displayed on the display device to indicate that a course section is ready; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> a second cursor is shown on the display device to indicate that a course section is ongoing; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> a third cursor is shown on the display device to indicate that a course section has been commenced but not yet completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the inventive method, the control system includes at least one recording or registering device which is operable to record the time spent by each individual on difference course sections. The method also includes the steps in which a fourth cursor is used to start and stop recording of the time spent for a course section by the recording device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the inventive method, the method also includes the step of enabling an individual to communicate in writing with a teacher, through the medium of a fifth cursor shown on the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The distributed computer network may consist of the Internet or a Wide Area Network (WAN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the inventive method, the method also includes a step in which when study material has been revised in the second memory device, the revised study material is distributed to those individuals who have chosen the course section affiliated with said study material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The method according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may, for instance, be carried out with a control system according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating a method of achieving quality ensured competence development in accordance with the present invention. The method starts at block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> with the step of an individual/student fetching information directly from the Internet for example, or in consultation with a supervisor. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with the step in which the individual/student makes a self-appraisal of his/her competence directly on, e.g., the Internet and in consultation with a supervisor either online or offline. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with the step in which there is established a validation plan in consultation with a supervisor either online or offline. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the step in which validation of theoretical competence, professional competence and possibly co-worker competence is carried out directly on, e.g., the Internet and in consultation with a supervisor, either online or offline. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> with the step in which an individual competence development plan is set-up against a target and with a starting point from the validation result directly on, e.g., the Internet and in consultation with a supervisor, either online or offline. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with the step in which the time and cost involved are calculated and a business confirmation/agreement is finalised directly on, e.g., the Internet or physically. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> with the step in which an individual competence development plan inclusive of digital study material is downloaded directly on the Internet. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with the step in which competence development is carried out directly on the Internet in accordance with an established competence development plan and with access to resources and support according to the business agreement/contract. The method is then continued at block <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with the step in which the question is asked as to whether the competence development is complete in accordance with the goal that has been set. If the answer is in the negative, the step according to block <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is repeated. If, on the other hand, the answer is positive, the method is continued at block <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in a step in which costs are calculated and reports and printouts of, e.g., grades and certificates are made directly on the Internet. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> with the step in which payment routines are carried out, i.e. payment obtained directly over the Internet or through the medium of invoices. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> with the step in which the finalised course plan is stored. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> with the step in which questions asked and answered are documented in a database as a query bank. The method is terminated at block <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of the process for validating pupil competence requirements. In the illustrated case, two pupils, pupil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and pupil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, have the goal of achieving competence corresponding to the course CNC technology, level <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the course sections included in the study plan for CNC technology, level <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Both pupils are given, e.g., a validation test to establish their previous knowledge. This validation test gives rise to individual study plans for the two different pupils. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> example, it is apparent that pupil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> needs to read four different course sections, whereas pupil <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> needs to read five different course sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates schematically the competence development process for pupil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the course section relating to CNC technology can be obtained from supplier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or from a combination of these suppliers. The course section relating to CAD/CAM can only be obtained from supplier <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates schematically a certifying process concerning pupil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. When pupil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has studied the course sections given in the course plan, it is time for a final examination/certification. When this step has been completed, i.e. when pupil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has shown sufficient competence, the individual course &ldquo;CNC technology, level 1&rdquo;, including all unique material that has been generated over the duration of the course is stored in a course archive for pupil <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating the validation part of the method for achieving quality ensured competence development in accordance with the present invention. The method starts at block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> with the step in which an individual/student fetches information/instructions directly from the Internet, for instance. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> with the step in which an individual test is created by automatic copying. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> with the step in which the individual/student takes the test, i.e. answers the questions asked in the test. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> with the step of automatically marking the answers. The answers are presented in the form of a marking template which shows which questions have been answered correctly by the individual/the student and those which have been answered incorrectly. The marking template is the same as an individual study plan with respect to the theoretical questions. A unique feature of the present invention is that the assumptions can be integrated and a practical test carried out where the result is marked or graded together with the theoretical test. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with the step of creating a random list in which the practical items are placed in a chronological order in accordance with the production process or the station system chosen for the test. All of the instructions, drawings, NC programs, etc., are now entered into the system with regard to each practical item, in the same way as that described under the competence development phase. The method then continues at block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> with the step in which the individual/student carries out a section of the practical item in accordance with the random list. Certain practical tests will have a maximum time entered in the system, which means that if the task is not completed within the time that has been set, the individual (student) will not be accepted. This is sensed by the system automatically. In these cases, the method continues at block <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with the step in which it is asked whether or not the task has been completed within the time set. If the answer to this question is negative, the step according to block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is repeated. On the other hand, if the answer to the question is positive, the method continues at block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> with the step in which it is asked whether or not the individual/student has been accepted with regard to the practical test section concerned. A supervisor marks the test accepted or not accepted, e.g., through the medium of a handheld computer (laptop) or a stationary computer in the workshop/examination room. The system marks each completed item/section, by showing a green tick on the screen. If the answer is negative, the step according to block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is repeated. On the other hand, if the answer is positive, the method continues to block <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in which it is asked whether or not all practical sections have been completed. If the answer to this question is negative, the method continues at block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, in which the step of passing to the next section is carried out. The method then continues by repeating the steps according to blocks <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, if the answer to the question is positive, the method continues at block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> with the step in which it is asked whether or not the individual/student has obtained a pass on the collected result. If the answer to this question is positive, the method continues with the step according to block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, in which a certificate/grade is issued. On the other hand, if the answer to the question is negative, the method continues to the step according to block <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in which an individual competence development plan is automatically created. The method is then terminated at block <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the method is terminated at block <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> after block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
