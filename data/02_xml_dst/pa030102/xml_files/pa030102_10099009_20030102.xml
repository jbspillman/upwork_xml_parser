<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This is a non-provisional application of provisional application Serial No. 60/290,538 filed May 11, 2001. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of projection television receivers and displays in general, and in particular, to projection television receivers and displays utilizing imagers having random row access, for example liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) imagers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Liquid crystal imagers, for example LCOS imagers, are often made with more rows than are wanted for a given application. The nature of a liquid crystal imager, particularly a normally white LCOS imager, is that used pixels cannot simply be left blank or empty, but must be driven to the blackest black level possible. It is necessary to write these unwanted rows with a black level as well as write the desired rows with video in order to avoid degradation of the imager. This might be necessary when a picture having a wide screen aspect ratio of 16:9 is displayed using an imager having an aspect ratio of 4:3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Inserting black rows is usually done by writing all the black rows needed at the top of the picture, followed by writing the desired video rows, followed by writing more black rows at the bottom of the picture. The desired rows are thus written in a shorter time period than they are formed by the incoming signal after it is processed by the formatting circuits. As a result, at least a partial field memory must be used to speed up the desired signal so that there is time to write the black rows. This requires substantial extra memory capacity and memory bandwidth to perform this function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is always a need in developing video display systems to reduce memory requirements and bandwidth, so that circuits can be simplified and costs can be reduced. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Extra rows of an LCOS imager can be written with black in accordance with the inventive arrangements by utilizing an imager with random row access and by speeding up the writing of desired image rows with a line memory and using the time remaining to write the black rows. The rows can be written by writing a black row for every one, two, or three, etc. image rows. The inventive arrangements make it possible to populate the unused rows of the imager at the black level and the active rows of the imager within the same time interval needed to display each field without the use of an unnecessarily large memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect of the present invention, an black line insertion system for an imager having random row access comprises a speedup line memory for reading out from the memory a plurality of horizontal lines as an output signal at a speed being a predetermined proportion faster than the speed the plurality of horizontal lines are written into the memory, whereby a proportionate time enhancement (further described below) is achieved and means for inserting a black line into the output signal during the proportionate time enhancement of the speedup line memory to provide a modified output signal. The system can include a means for presenting the modified output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the present invention, a method of modifying an input video signal to accommodate an overly tall imager comprising the steps of increasing the horizontal frequency of a modified output signal by a predetermined ratio, multiplexing an output signal with a black line input signal to provide the modified output signal, wherein the predetermined ratio determines a periodicity of the multiplexed black line input signal, and presenting the modified output signal on the overly tall imager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect of the present invention, a method of modifying an input video signal to accommodate an overly tall imager comprises the steps of reading out from memory a plurality of horizontal lines as an output signal at a speed being a predetermined proportion faster than the speed the plurality of horizontal lines are written into the memory, whereby a proportionate time enhancement is achieved and periodically multiplexing a black line input signal with the output signal during at least a portion of the proportionate time enhancement to provide a modified output signal. The method can also include the step of presenting the modified output signal on the overly tall imager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a fourth aspect of the present invention, a method of black line insertion for overly tall imagers having random row access comprises the steps of periodically writing in a predetermined number of input video lines into a memory, speeding up the reading of the predetermined number of input video lines out from said memory to provide a time enhancement. and multiplexing a black input line with the sped-up predetermined number of input video lines during the time enhancement to provide an output image. The method in accordance with this embodiment can further include the step of presenting the output image on the overly tall imager. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With reference to the video display system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the input video is written into a speedup line memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the speedup factor is 1.5, and the input has a horizontal scanning frequency of f<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, for example, the output lines will have a period, for example, of {fraction (1/1.5)} f<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>. After &frac23;rds of a line is written, the line memory starts to be read out as a first input to a multiplexer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The multiplexer selects the reading output of the line memory to be displayed. The multiplexer has a black pixel level as a second input. A controller <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> selects the proper row in the display or imager for the line to be written to the display. The reading speed (reading out of the line memory), as noted, is faster than the writing speed (into the line memory). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> After reading out or displaying two lines in this manner, using four-thirds of a line period when a 1.5 speedup factor is employed, the controller instructs the display to write a black row. This black row is displayed for another &frac23; of an input line period. This cycle then repeats, allowing up to one-third of the lines written to be black-insertion lines at the top and bottom of the picture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A timing diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the sequence. As line <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is written into the line memory, a first black line is supplied to row <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the imager. Image lines <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are supplied to the imager, each in &frac23; of an input line period. Three image lines (two image lines and one black line) are supplied to three rows of the imager in the time it would otherwise take two image lines to be written into the line memory. In a similar fashion, a second black line and image lines <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, are supplied to the image in the same time period needed to write two lines into the memory. The cycle repeats until the imager is fully loaded with picture data and black lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As an alternative, it is possible to write the black rows alternately to the top and bottom of the imager, rather than filling in the top black bar entirely before filling in the lower black bar. It should also be understood within contemplation of the present invention that the black lines could be inserted all on the top or all on the bottom or in a proportion divided between the top and bottom as desired using a random row access imager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> flow chart illustrating a method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of modifying an input video signal to accommodate an overly tall imager is shown. Method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> preferably comprises the step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of increasing the horizontal frequency of an output signal by a predetermined ratio, periodically multiplexing at step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> the output signal with a black line input signal to provide a modified output signal, wherein the predetermined ratio determines a periodicity of the multiplexed black line input signal. The method further comprises the step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of presenting the modified output signal on the overly tall imager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> flow chart illustrating a method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of modifying an input video signal to accommodate an overly tall imager is shown. The method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> preferably comprises the step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of reading out from memory a plurality of horizontal lines as an output signal at a speed being a predetermined proportion faster than the speed the plurality of horizontal lines are written into the memory, whereby a proportionate time enhancement is achieved. The time enhancement is evident in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by the shortening of time occupied by the first two lines at the output versus the time occupied by the first two lines at the input. At step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, a black line input signal is periodically multiplexed with the output signal during at least a portion of the proportionate time enhancement to provide a modified output signal. If the predetermined proportion is 3 to 2 for example, then up to a third of a total number of horizontal lines of the overly tall imager can be filled with black lines. At step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, the modified output signal can then be presented or displayed on the overly tall imager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> flow chart illustrating yet another method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of black line insertion for overly tall imagers having random row access is shown. The method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> preferably comprises the step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of periodically writing in a predetermined number of input video lines into a memory and the step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> of speeding up the reading of the predetermined number of input video lines out from to memory to provide a time enhancement. The method further comprises the step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> of multiplexing a black input line with said sped-up predetermined number of input video lines during the time enhancement to provide an output image. Preferably, the step of speeding up includes a speedup factor that will result in an output line period that is inversely proportional to the number of lines in the overly tall imager. Finally, the method can include the step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of presenting on the overly tall imager the output image using the random row access of the imager to place the lines in the correct vertical position. </paragraph>
