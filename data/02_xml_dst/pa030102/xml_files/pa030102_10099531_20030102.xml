<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Optical interconnection devices such as optical wave guides have been designed for application of chip-to-chip connections and other electrical components. The advantages of the use of organic polymer films are the large signal band widths and reduced propagation delay, and are amenable to solution spin casting and other techniques. Organic polymers have lower dielectric constants and can have large electro-optic or other nonlinear optical responses that are electronic in origin and therefore have low losses even in high frequency regimes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Standard lithography processes, together with dry etching, have been used to create experimental integrated optical wave guides. Optical wave guides have been formed in organic films by inducing refractive index changes by ultraviolet light in methods such as: (1) photochemical crosslinking, followed by dissolution of the remaining uncross linked material; (2) &ldquo;photo-locking&rdquo; i.e. photochemical attachment, dimerization or polymerization of high refractive index monomer in a transparent polymer matrix film, followed by baking to remove the remaining volatile monomer from non-irradiated areas; (3) pattered argon ion laser irradiation; (4) thermal annealing; and (5) electron beam radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Formation of wave-guide structures in optical organic materials through the photochemical transformation disclosed, for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,783,136, 4,889,405 and 5,054,872. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Past methods and active media for controlled production and optical access of data include controlled differences in absorption characteristics of molecules at selected regions. This involves the use of at least two intersecting beams of radiation which are matched to selected optical properties of an active media. A bit of data at a selected portion of a region of active media is accessed by directing a first beam having a first electromagnetic radiation characteristics matched to a first optical characteristic of the media at the region to change the condition of the media to a second characteristic. This second characteristic may be of either low or high optical reactivity, depending on the bit valve at programmed portions of the region. The second characteristic is relative to a second radiation characteristic, other than the first radiation characteristic, then directing a second beam matched to the second electromagnetic radiation characteristic to intersect the region at a selected portion containing the bit of data to be accessed to permit optical sensing of the state of the bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Optical type elements perform information processing on an input signal light beam through the use of light beams including the signal light beam and an auxiliary light beam for assisting operation. The optical element includes aggregates which are dispersed within the optical element as optical functional aggregates, and which are composed of a single kind or multiple kinds of compounds including a single species of atoms or molecules. Aggregates are dispersed within a transparent polymer film and are responsive to auxiliary light beam to perform a function on an input signal light beam to produce an output signal beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This invention is designed to process information using optical materials in a complex network structure which is referred to as the interconnecting network structure, herein referred to as the &ldquo;optical cell&rdquo;. Other patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,136,682 and 5,273,863, document the use of polymeric materials to form optical films for interconnecting opto-electric devices and systems. The present invention is based on the total optical process that does not require any such interconnection of opto-electric processing devices and/or systems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Although the disclosure hereof is detailed and exact to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the physical embodiments herein disclosed merely exemplify the invention which may be embodied in other specific structures. While the preferred embodiment has been described, the details may be changed without departing from the invention, which is defined by the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> To build the optical circuit device, an interconnecting network based on optical fiber parameters must be designed. This goal is accomplished by identifying and calculating the total internal reflection required to transmit the selected frequency of light used as the main signal source. The formula is &thgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;(sin/1)n<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/n<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Here, &thgr;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>is the maximum angle at which a light beam can enter an optical pathway, while n<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and n<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are the refractive indices of the core and clad layer, respectively. The materials selected to construct the optical interconnection are based on the urethane acrylates, acrylate esters, epoxy acrylates, elastomeric acrylates, methacrylates, triacrylates, diacrylates and dimethylacrylates. Plasticizers, crosslinking agents, photoinitiators, radical scavengers, organic optical polar materials, photo-reactive materials, phosphorescent and fluorescent materials, inorganic optical materials, which undergo curing by UV light are incorporated into these compositions as required to form the structure. The first step is to select the base layer with a lower refractive index than the core material. For example, in formulating the base clad material with Ebecryl 810 (from Radcure) a reflective index of 1.4641 is obtained. In formulating the core material using Ebecryl 3700 as the acrylic polymer, a refractive index of 1.5555 is obtained. A starting composition for the base is as follows:

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Using the above-noted base formula, it is possible to formulate various compositions to give different index of refraction values to create the desired wave guide characteristics. It is to be understood that the foregoing composition formulae are intended as examples only, and that many other formulas may be substituted depending upon the desired ratios or desired index of refraction. In the formation of an optical polymer composite, which forms the optical &ldquo;circuit board&rdquo; and optical gate structure, the materials must satisfy a number of requirements and properties. Among the numerous properties the composite formula must produce high optical transparency at wavelengths from 200-2000 nm (preferably, 405-2000 nm range), rapid and complete curve characteristics, workable fluid phase precursor, selective and specific refractive indices. These composite formulations must also be able to adhere securely to various substrate materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> These materials will produce an interconnecting network that will allow a light signal to be transmitted. To construct the optical circuit, a photo tool is constructed using standard lithographic processes incorporating the physical principles of phase relation between two light signals. In the formation of the core design, the optical coherence which is constructive and destructive interference are the main principles used to calculate the design of the optical wave guides. The formula for constructive interference is sin &thgr;m&equals;m&lgr;/d and for destructive interference is Sin &thgr;m&equals;(m&plus;&frac12;)&lgr;/d, where Sin &thgr;m is the angle of the light path where the light beams intersect, m is an integer representing the actual frequency, &lgr; is the frequency of light, and d is the distance between each light beam if the light is passing through a slit film. In the case of fiber optic or wave-guide, the d factor is the length of the optical cell or pathway. These formulae are used to calculate the design of the signal path which will create the first part of an optical logic gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A simplified gate design is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> wherein light source A is split into two coherent beams by an internal beam splitter imbedded into a wave-guide, the two split signals traverse path B and C and superpose at point D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Using the formula for destructive interference, the signal from path B will be out of phase from that of path C by 180&deg;. At point D the signal will be canceled. At this point the device is at a continuous &ldquo;off state&rdquo;. To create the &ldquo;on-off state&rdquo; optically active materials, specifically phosphorescent or fluorescent materials, are incorporated into paths B and C. These optically active materials react to the respective split beams by which they are impacted to produce secondary light beams having frequencies dependent upon the specific phosphorescent or fluorescent materials selected. The optically active materials may also include filters, mirrors, photo-reactive chemicals, or polarizing material. It is preferred that each node B and C include a light polarizing structure in order to limit the light waves to a single plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Phosphors are thus an integral part of the optical gate as they are the main switching components. Phosphors are materials, which emit UV, visible, or infrared light when exposed to an energy source. Conventional phosphors are either self-activated or impurity-activated. Using these types of materials in combination with the wave-guide structure creates the &ldquo;on-off state&rdquo;, which in turn provides a functional logic gate structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Using the previous design and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as an example, a light signal is split at point A into beam components which traverse path B and C, respectively. In path C, a phosphor material is imbedded which has a phosphorescent time of 1 second. As the light signal is superposed at point D a one-second pulse is created. An &ldquo;on-off state&rdquo; is thereby created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Using this basic design, numerous possible combinations may be created using polarized filters, optical fibers, optical materials, multi-channeling systems, matrix-matrix designs, matrix-vector designs, or other optical systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Optical traces consisting of many individual cells of the general type depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each with embedded optical chemicals and or components, thus are combined to create an optical processing matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to optical devices and systems constructed either wholly or in part by methods disclosed herein, that are based on light transmissive pathways of the type shown. The pathways are preferably formed by exposing a photographic film along a pattern matching the dimensions of the desired pathway. The film is then used as a mask for exposing a cast polymer layer with photoinitiating radiation through the exposed regions of the mask to form a partially cured polymeric shape having the desired dimensions. The optical device is thus formed in the acrylate polymeric composition by exposing predetermined areas to sufficient actinic radiation to form the structure of the desired shape and dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The polarizing devices are then positioned in the polymer at locations where they will intercept the light beams prior to entering the nodes B and C. The selected phosphors are then inserted at point B and C to form the nodes. The polymers may be adhered to a base material and curing completed. In the finished matrix, the matrix pathway material may be interfaced with air on its exposed sides or, if desired, an polymer having a lower refractive index that the matrix material may be cast thereover and cured. As noted, to form a functional data processing device, it is contemplated that a large number of matrix cells of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be interconnected using connector devices such as fiber optic strands connected to the input and output points of each of the optical pathways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As noted, the preferred materials for forming the light transmissive pathways are urethane acrylates, acrylate esters, epoxy acrylates, elastomeric acrylates, methacrylates, triacrylates, diacrylates, dimethacrylates and acrylates. Plasticizers, crosslinking agents, photoinitiators, radical scavengers and the like may be used as is known in the polymer art. In devising a specific optical processor device, various organic optical polar materials, proteins, photo-reactive materials, phosphorescent materials, fluorescent materials, inorganic optical materials, which may or may not undergo change in refractive index and in structure upon exposure to actinic radiation, may also be incorporated into the structures. By combining these optical materials and acrylate polymers in a predetermined structure, an interconnecting optical network structure can be formed into an optical processor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As noted, the fabrication of polymeric optical devices of this invention use the foregoing industrial polymers, which are also preferred. In the formation of an optical polymer composite, which forms the optical network processor structure, the materials must satisfy a number of requirements and manifest certain requisite properties. Among the numerous properties such material must posses: high optical transparency at wave lengths of interest 200-2000 nm (especially the 400-2000 nm spectral region); rapid and complete cure characteristics; workable fluid phase precursor consistencies prior to placement and cure; and selective and controllable refractive indices (especially the 1.4606-1.555 refractive index region). Further, it is preferred that materials to be used exhibit an adhesive characteristic able to adequately secure to the various substrates. In the fabrication of the interconnecting optical network structure, the aforementioned optical polymer materials form the substrate structure and the optical materials form the optical network processor structure. The optical network processor structure which allows computations to be performed is formed by the substrate structure in combination with the optical materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Optical computers of this invention are based on optical phenomena. That is, in the context of optical computing, the most basic characteristic in the transmission of information is light, specifically light which occupies a rather narrow band width between 10E14 cps and 10E15 cps. Optical computers operate in this range because of the selectivity of photo-reactive materials in this range. In describing a lightwave used to transmit information, three parameters are commonly used: frequency, amplitude, and phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For optical computation purposes the amplitude and the phase are sometimes linked together to form one complex value A: the modulus is the amplitude and the argument is the phase. This is referred to as the complex amplitude of the wave. When two waves combine, it is referred to as interference. If the crests in one wave coincide with the crests in the other, the waves reinforce each other, this is referred to as constructive interference. If the crest in one wave matches the trough in the other, the waves cancel out. This is referred to as destructive interference. These principles of light waves are important in optical computers for the manipulation of data. Optical processing systems use many different types of operations to manipulate data such as: multi-channel systems, which is a bipolar data stream which are represented by two unipolar data streams, one of positive value and the other a negative value; spatial carrier modulation, which is a pattern of high spatial frequency imposed on the cross section of the light beam; matrices and matrix operations; matrix-vector multiplication; systolic arrays; crossbar switch; matrix-matrix multiplication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Other optical devices which enable optical processing systems to operate are photo-refractive optical storage devices and systems. Photo-refractive storage devices are based on the photo-refractive effect which refers to the spatial modulation of the refractive index in electro-optic crystals under non-uniform illumination of light. The following processes are generally involved: 1. Generation of charged carriers from some impurity level to conduction or valence band; 2. Migration of the free carriers due to diffusion and/or drift; 3. Capturing of the charged carriers by some trap centers in the dark regions; 4. Formation of non-uniform ionic charge distribution and association non-uniform space charge field; 5. Modulation of the refractive index by space charge field via linear electro-optic effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As stated previously in this disclosure, various industrial polymeric materials are available for the formation of the base structure in the optical cell. Examples of polymers of this type include acrylic monomers which are used to provide diluents to the polymeric formation and enhance cure speed and physical properties of the polymeric structure. Additionally, acrylate epoxy oligomers are considered which provide resistance to a number of chemicals and have a fast cure speed with good hardness value. Acrylate aliphatic urethane oligomers may be used and provide non-yellowing polymers having good light transmittance, toughness, flexibility and exterior durability. Acrylate aromatic urethane oligomers provide flexibility and toughness. Acrylated polyester oligomers provide low viscosity and fast cure speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Specialty polyester oligomers improve formation characteristics for lithographic processes and adhesion to substrates. Acrylated acrylic oligomers provide non-yellowing, solvent resistance, and promote adhesion to difficult substrates. B-carboxyethyl acrylate is a reactive monomer containing both acrylate and carboxylic acid functionality, predominantly as the acrylic dimer, which contributes to low glass transition temperature and promotes adhesion. Isobornyl acrylate is a high purity, low color monofunctional diluent monomer, moisture resistant and electrical resistant, provides high Tg when actinic radiation is used to cure, and may increase hardness and abrasion resistance. Octyl/decyl acrylate mixtures of monofunctional monomers consisting of linear eight and ten carbon acrylate esters have good diluent properties, high flash point, low Tg characteristics, and good adhesive applications. Oxyethylated acrylate monomer, have low viscosity, low Tg, good ultraviolet light and electron beam cure process. 1, 6 hexanediol diacrylate is difunctional monomer for the purpose of but not limiting to, improved elasticity, weathering, adhesion, to metal and glass. Tripropylene gylcol diacrylate is a difunctional monomer with branched alkyl polyether backbone, which has the purpose of flexibility, water resistance, low viscosity and cure speed. Bisphenol-A derivative diacrylate monomer is for high reactivity and low volatility. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate is a trifunctional monomer which contributes to rapid cure response, hardness, chemical and abrasion resistance; Acrylated trifunctional monomer based on glycerol derivative has low viscosity, good flexibility, fast cure speed and excellent hardness. Pentaerythritol triacrylate a multifunctional monomer which provides a high degree of crosslinking and residual hydroxyl functionality, with rapid cure response. Trimethylolpropane ethoxy triacrylate is a trifunctional monomer which is more flexible than TMPTA and retains hardness and abrasion resistance. Acrylated dipentaerythritol is a multifunctional monomer which is used to increase cure speed and abrasion resistance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The sulfides of the alkaline earths (Ca, Sr, and Ba), Zn and Cd are photo-conductive, while oxide phosphors are not. The photo conductors are much more sensitive to impurities than non-photoconductive materials. Concentrations of added impurities must be low in the range of 0.01 to 0.05% wt. Greater concentrations reduce the effect, causing a quenching effect. The best activators are Cu, Ag, Mn, and Eu&plus;2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The function of this material is to create complex information transmission signals in the optical cell for data manipulation when activated by the primary light beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The polar material (polarizers and optical filters) which are incorporated into the optical cell structure in this invention are preferably of four main types. These types are glass, gelatin, plastic, and blocking filters, but it is to be understood that this disclosure is not to be limited to any particular filter type. The preferred materials are in the form of these plastic films which are positioned transversely to the optical pathway. The wave lengths required to form the polarized structures for the optical cell range from 220 nm to greater than 1000 nm. Some examples of the types of commercially available filters are; HU-330, C 9863, HU-340, HUV-28, HB-380, HUV-30, C 5850, C 5330, PUV-4, S BG series, C 4380, C4305, C4784, H L-38, VG12, W O, W 38, W 1A, W38A, GG19, S UG19, S UG11, P 18A, S UG series, C 4000 series, C 5000 series, Ch OB series, B 12, C 48, W 36, B series, W series, S VG series, H series, GG series, H Y series, S GG series, S OG series, Ch OY series, P 16, C 3482, Ch OR series, H R-72, P 89B, C 2408, H RM-90, H RM-90, and S BG 23 (Dow or Kodak). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The optical cell structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be formed by the combination of a predetermined formulation(s) of polymeric materials with additives to form the basic foundation. The placement of the optical material in a predetermined structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (in the primary layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>), which is cured with actinic radiation, in a preferred method, forms the optical cell structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The method of forming the optical cell structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> 1. Forming a layer of primer base polymer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having a refractive index less than the primary polymeric layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> used to form the optical cell structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> 2. Applying to a substrate and partially curing the primer layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by exposure to actinic radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> 3. Mechanically placing optical components <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which are preferably phosphors producing, when activated, a secondary light beam of a preselected frequency. Polarizing materials <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are positioned after points A and B, respectively, so that the secondary beams are limited to a single plane in the optical pathway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> 4. Depositing the polymeric material <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to form the optical cell structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> 5. Partially curing the layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> through a photographic film of similar mask to form the desired shape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> 6. Incorporating the optical components <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into the optical cell structure in specified areas A and B of the optical cell (as an alternative to Step 3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> 7. Finalizing the cure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The optical cells of this invention can be connected to holographic storage devices without the use of a conventional multiplexer. The multiplexing function can be incorporated into a structure which is formed by a matrix of cells of this invention. Such matrix could include at least 100 and preferably several thousand individual cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Holographic data recording and subsequent readout can be used to establish a massive interconnection network between the optical cell structures, in an input/output plane to array or matrix structures. Volume phase holograms are ideal for multiple storage because of their large storage capacity. </paragraph>

Exposure time is preferably 30-50 seconds, although it is within the realm of the present invention to include other cure times. Exposure to the ultraviolet light forms a rigid structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which encapsulates the fluorescent material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the pre-determined, calculated node locations A and B.

A ball lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used to connect fiber optic material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to polymer layer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The light excites the fluorescent material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and induces light having a pre-determined frequency.

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the ball lenses <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>will each only be in contact with one ball lens, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e, </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f, </italic></highlight>of the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at any given time.

For example, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the light from ball lens <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will travel from ball lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>across pathway <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to ball lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, rotation of microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can be configured for a plurality of different pathways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> planar side-view of the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is shown. A motor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the underside of the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by way of an industrial-type adhesive having similar characteristics as the polymer to be used. The motor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> allows the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to rotate. A preferred source of power for the motor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is a photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be comprised of a group of cells made from silicon materials or similar materials that will be able to deliver an electrical current. The current from the photovoltaic cell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be regulated so as to control the speed at which the motor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> rotates the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, and as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the power source for the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be based on a magnetic disk or wafer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is set in motion by an electromagnetic device powered by a photocell <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or other photoconductive material, such as a photochromophore.

In this manner, the disk <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is redirected to another alignment. The magnetic wafer is preferably fabricated from a composite material consisting of 5-10 nm magnetic iron-oxide particles lodged in a polymer matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, and as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the system may be powered by use of a photochromophore material <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>that is, material that may be expanded or contracted with light. As seen, the light signal may pass through the polymer trace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and after diversion by a beam splitter <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, activate a photochromophore <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which then either contracts or expands, thereby activating and redirecting the magnetic disk <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> polymer pathway <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is shown.

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The spinning of the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> allows for a device that could be used as an electronic timer of predetermined time lengths, similar to timing devices used in computers and calculators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the light source allows for the entrance of light rays at two separate ball lenses, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The first signal at <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can proceed along one of the polymer paths of the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The second signal at <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be used to rotate the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> a specific distance, allowing the first signal to be transmitted to another location. The new position may be along a new pathway, or may be orientated to interact with another microdisk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, may also be stacked upon one another or, alternatively, arranged in a flat array as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Stacking of the microdisks <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> adds another available dimension that can be controlled for more precise functions. The optical circuit of a single microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may now be used with other microdisks <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to form an optical array circuit. The plurality of pathways may now be created by the light signals traveling across the polymer trace of one microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, or traveling from one microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to another microdisk <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by the specific alignment of the microdisks <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
