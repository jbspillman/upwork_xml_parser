<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to multipotent stem cells (MSCs) purified from peripheral tissues including peripheral tissues containing sensory receptors such as skin, olfactory epithelium, mucosa, and tongue. The invention also relates to cells differentiated from these multipotent stem cells. The invention includes pharmaceutical compositions and uses of either the multipotent stem cells or the differentiated cells derived from such stem cells. Additionally, business methods based on the multipotent stem cells or the differentiated cells are contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> There are a number of diseases of the central nervous system (&ldquo;CNS&rdquo;) which have a devastating effect on patients. These diseases are debilitating, often incurable, and include, for example, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, Huntington&apos;s disease, Parkinson&apos;s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> By way of example, Parkinson&apos;s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of unknown cause. In healthy brain tissue, dopaminergic neurons extend from the substantia nigra of the brain into the neighboring striatum. In Parkinson&apos;s disease, these dopaminergic neurons die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are a number of methods to treat Parkinson&apos;s disease. One method is to treat humans having Parkinson&apos;s disease with L-DOPA. A second method is to transplant cells into the substantia nigra or striatum. Transplanted cells replace endogenous cells that are lost as a consequence of disease progression. An animal model of Parkinson&apos;s disease is an MPTP-treated non-human primate. The MPTP-treated animals have been transplanted with dopamine-rich embryonic neurons with some success. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To date, the cells used for neural transplant have been collected from the developing brains of aborted fetuses. Aside from the ethical considerations, the method from a practical standpoint is unlikely to provide a sufficient amount of neural tissue to meet the demands. Thus, another source of cells for transplantation is desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that exist in many tissues of embryos and adult organisms. In embryos, blastocyst stem cells are the source of cells which differentiate to form the specialized tissues and organs of the developing fetus. In adults, specialized stem cells in individual tissues are the source of new cells, replacing cells lost through cell death due to natural attrition, disease, or injury. Stem cells may be used as substrates for producing healthy tissue where a disease, disorder, or abnormal physical state has destroyed or damaged normal tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Weiss et al., 1996 summarizes the five defining characteristics of stem cells as the ability to: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Proliferate: Stem cells are capable of dividing to produce daughter cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Exhibit self-maintenance or renewal over the lifetime of the organism: Stem cells are capable of reproducing by dividing symmetrically or asymmetrically to produce new stem cells. Symmetric division occurs when one stem cell divides into two daughter stem cells. Asymmetric division occurs when one stem cell forms one new stem cell and one progenitor cell. Symmetric division is a source of renewal of stem cells. This permits stem cells to maintain a consistent level of stem cells in an embryo or adult mammal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Generate large number of progeny: Stem cells may produce a large number of progeny through the transient amplification of a population of progenitor cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Retain their multilineage potential over time: Stem cells are the ultimate source of differentiated tissue cells, so they retain their ability to produce multiple types of progenitor cells, which will in turn develop into specialized tissue cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Generate new cells in response to injury or disease: This is essential in tissues which have a high turnover rate or which are more likely to be subject to injury or disease, such as the epithelium of blood cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, the key features of stem cells are that they are multipotential cells which are capable of long-term self-renewal over the lifetime of a mammal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> MSCs may be used as a source of cells for transplantation. The stem cells may themselves be transplanted or, alternatively, they may be induced to produce differentiated cells (e.g., neurons, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, or astrocytes) for transplantation. Transplanted stem cells may also be used to express therapeutic molecules, such as growth factors, cytokines, anti-apoptotic proteins, and the like. Thus, stem cells are a potential source of cells for alternative treatments of diseases involving loss of cells or tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The safest type of tissue graft (using stem cells or otherwise) is one that comes from self (an autologous tissue source). Autologous tissue sources are widely used in procedures such as bone transplants and skin transplants because a source of healthy tissue is readily accessible for transplant to a damaged tissue site. In brain diseases, such as Parkinson&apos;s disease, healthy dopaminergic neuronal brain tissue may exist at other sites in the brain, but attempts to transplant these neurons may harm the site where the healthy neurons originate. Multipotent stem cells that can be differentiated into dopaminergic neurons may be available at other sites from which they may be transplanted, but the CNS, particularly the brain, is physically difficult to access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In several tissues, stem cells have been purified and characterized. For example, neural stem cells have been purified from the mammalian forebrain (Reynolds and Weiss, Science 255:1707-1710, 1992) and these cells were shown to be capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. PCT publications WO 93/01275, WO 94/16718, WO 94/10292 and WO 94/09119 describe uses for these cells. It could be impractical or impossible, however, to first access brain or other CNS tissue for biopsy and then again for transplant in patients with weakened health. It would be very useful if there were accessible stem cells capable of differentiating into CNS cell types, such as dopaminergic neurons; such cells would be a source of cells for autologous transplants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a clear need to develop methods for identifying from accessible tissues multipotent stem cells that can act as a source of cells that are transplantable to the CNS, PNS, or other tissues in vivo in order to replace damaged or diseased tissue. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention relates to preparations of purified multipotent stem cells that are obtained from peripheral tissue of mammals, preferably from postnatal mammals such as juvenile and adult mammals. We have identified epithelial tissues, such as skin, as convenient sources of multipotent stem cells, and provide methods for the purification of epithelial-derived MSCs, thus simplifying the harvesting of cells for transplantation relative to previous methods. The MSCs possess desirable features in that they are multipotent and self-renewing. The cells can be repeatedly passaged and can be differentiated into numerous cell types of the body including derivatives of ectodermal and mesodermal tissue. The MSCs of this invention are positive for nestin protein, an immunological marker of stem cells and progenitor cells, as well as fibronectin protein, but are negative for vimentin and cytokeratin when assayed by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the MSCs of the present invention grow as non-adherent clusters when cultured by the methods herein disclosed, and one of skill in the art will readily recognize that such cells will grow as non-adherent clusters when cultured on a variety of substratum including but not limited to uncoated plastic or plastic coated with a neutral substrate such as gelatin or agar. In certain embodiments, the MSCs of this invention are negative for the neural crest stem cell marker p75. These characteristics distinguish the cells of this invention from other stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells and neural crest stem cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the cells are capable of differentiating as dopaminergic neurons, and thus are a useful source of dopaminergic neurons for homotypic grafts into Parkinson&apos;s Disease patients. The MSCs can also differentiate as numerous mesodermal derivatives including smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, cartilage, bone, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle, and are expected to be capable of producing other mesodermal derivatives including kidney and hematopoietic cells. Additionally, we show that the MSCs can express markers of endodermal differentiation, and are expected to differentiate to cell types including pancreatic islet cells (e.g., alpha, beta, phi, delta cells), hepatocytes, and the like. To our knowledge, the MSCs of the invention represent the first adult stem cell capable of differentiating to cell derived from all three germ layers. The subject cells may also be used for autologous or heterologous transplants to treat, for example, other neurodegenerative diseases, disorders, or abnormal physical states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention features MSCs substantially purified from a peripheral tissue of a postnatal mammal. In preferred embodiments, the peripheral tissue is an epithelial tissue including skin or mucosal tissue. In a second embodiment, the peripheral tissue is derived from the tongue. In still another embodiment, the tissue is derived from skin. The postnatal mammal may be either a juvenile or adult mammal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, the invention features a cell that is the progeny of a MSC substantially purified from a peripheral tissue of a postnatal mammal. The cell may be a mitotic cell or a differentiated cell (e.g., a neuron, an astrocyte, an oligodendrocyte, a Schwann cell, or a non-neural cell). Preferred neurons include neurons expressing one or more of the following neurotransmitters: dopamine, GABA, glycine, acetylcholine, glutamate, and serotonin. Preferred non-neural cells include cardiac muscle cells, pancreatic cells (e.g., islet cells (alpha, beta, phi and delta cells), exocrine cells, endocrine cells, chondrocytes, osteocytes, skeletal muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells, and adipocytes. These non-neural cell types include both mesodermal and endodermal derivatives. In a preferred embodiment, the differentiated cells are substantially purified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, the invention features a population of at least ten cells, wherein at least 30% of the cells are MSCs substantially purified from a peripheral tissue of a postnatal mammal or progeny of the MSCs. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing aspects of the invention, it is appreciated that the MSCs of the invention can proliferate in culture, and differentiate to derivatives of all three germ layers. Therefor, the MSCs provide novel compositions of adult stem cells which have therapeutic applications in treating conditions which affect wide range of cell types derived from all three germ layers. Recognizing the ability of these cells to differentiate to derivatives of all three germ layers, in a fifteen aspect, the invention includes a cellular composition of adult stem cells which (i) will proliferate in an in vitro culture, (ii) maintains the potential to differentiate to derivatives of endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm tissues throughout the culture, and (iii) is inhibited from differentiation when cultured under proliferative conditions. </paragraph>

The non-stem cell progeny of a single MSC are capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes. Hence, the stem cell is &ldquo;multipotent&rdquo; because its progeny have multiple differentiative pathways. The MSC also has the potential to differentiate as another non-neuronal cell type (e.g., a skin cell, a hematopoietic cell, a smooth muscle cell, a cardiac muscle cell, a skeletal muscle cell, a bone cell, a cartilage cell, a pancreatic cell or an adipocyte). </paragraph>

Additionally, therapeutic proteins include receptors for and the intracellular components of signal transduction pathways. These signal transduction pathway are well known in the art (hedgehog pathway, Wnt pathway, BMP pathway, Notch pathway, FGF, etc), and one of skill will recognize that expression and/or treatment with components (ligands, receptors, or intracellular components) of a signal transduction pathway can modulate signaling via that pathway with subsequent effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or survival. </paragraph>

Any of these parameters may be altered individually or in combination, and combinations of these parameters can be manipulated at the same time or at different times. Additionally, it is understood, that the MSCs can be sorted prior to plating, such that a sub-population of MSCs are subjected to the differentiation conditions. Sorting of the MSCs may be based on the expression (or lack of expression) of a gene or protein. Furthermore, sorting of the MSCs may be based on cellular characteristics including cell adhesion, or morphology. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and the claims. It will be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of example only, and various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> We have substantially purified multipotent stem cells (MSCs) from peripheral tissues of mammals, including skin, olfactory epithelium, and tongue. These cells proliferate in culture, so that large numbers of stem cells can be generated. These cells can be induced to differentiate, for example, into neurons, astrocytes, and/or oligodendrocytes by altering the culture conditions. They can also be induced to differentiate into non-neural cells such as smooth muscle cells, cartilage, bone, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipocytes. The substantially purified neural stem cells are thus useful for generating cells for use, for example, in autologous transplants for the treatment of degenerative disorders or trauma (e.g., spinal cord injury). In one example, MSCs may be differentiated into dopaminergic neurons and implanted in the substantia nigra or striatum of a Parkinson&apos;s disease patient. In a second example, the cells may be used to generate oligodendrocytes for use in autologous transplants for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. In a third example, the MSCs may be used to generate Schwann cells for treatment of spinal cord injury, cardiac cells for the treatment of heart disease, or pancreatic islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. In a fourth example, MSCs may be used to generate adipocytes for the treatment of anorexia or wasting associated with many diseases including AIDS, cancer, and cancer treatments. In a fifth example, MSCs may be used to generate smooth muscle cells to be used in vascular grafts. In a sixth example, MSCs may be used to generate cartilage to be used to treat cartilage injuries and degenerative conditions of cartilage. In still another example, MSCs may be used to replace cells damaged or lost to bacterial or viral infection, or those lost to traumatic injuries such as bums, fractures, and lacerations. If desired, in any of the foregoing examples, the cells may be genetically modified to express, for example, a growth factor, an anti-apoptotic protein, or another therapeutic protein. Similarly, the proliferation, differentiation, or survival of the MSCs of the invention can be influenced by modulating the cell culture conditions including increasing or decreasing the concentration of serum in the culture medium and increasing or decreasing the plating density. Additionally, modulating the cell culture conditions includes contacting the MSCs (by adding to the culture medium) with an agent or agents that influence proliferation, differentiation, or survival. Exemplary agents include therapeutic proteins (i.e., growth factors, cytokines, cell-fate determining proteins, and anti-apoptotic factors), small molecules which may agonize or antagonize the effects of any of the foregoing proteins, and pharmacological agents. In one embodiment, the MSCs are presorted prior to plating and differentiation such that only a sub-population of MSCs are subjected to the differentiation conditions. Presorting of the MS Cs can be done based on expression (or lack of expression) of a gene or protein, or based on differential cellular properties including adhesion and morphology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The MSCs display some similarities to stem cells derived from mammalian forebrain, but also possess some distinctive differences. Firstly, non-adherent clusters of the proliferating MSCs of the invention are morphologically distinct from CNS derived neurospheres. Additionally, when the MSCs of the present invention differentiate in the presence of serum, about 5-20% of the differentiated cells express neuronal markers, whereas differentiated forebrain stem cells generate only a small percentage of neurons. Moreover, significant numbers of dopaminergic neurons are found in differentiated cultures of MSCs of the present invention, whereas such neurons have not been observed in cultures of forebrain stem cells differentiated in serum. Furthermore, we have not observed any significant effects on the proliferation, differentiation or survival of the stem cells of the present invention when cultured in the presence versus the absence of LIF. Thus, the MSCs of the invention represent a novel stem cell population which can differentiate to form both neural and non-neural cell types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Cell Therapy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The multipotent stem cells of this invention may be used to prepare pharmaceutical compositions that can be administered to humans or animals for cell therapy. The cells may be undifferentiated or differentiated prior to administration. Dosages to be administered depend on patient needs, on the desired effect, and on the chosen route of administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The invention also features the use of the cells of this invention to introduce therapeutic compounds into the diseased, damaged, or physically abnormal CNS, PNS, or other tissue. The MSCs thus act as a vector to transport the compound. In order to allow for expression of the therapeutic compound, suitable regulatory elements may be derived from a variety of sources, and may be readily selected by one with ordinary skill in the art. Examples of regulatory elements include a transcriptional promoter and enhancer or RNA polymerase binding sequence, and a ribosomal binding sequence, including a translation initiation signal. Additionally, depending on the vector employed, other genetic elements, such as selectable markers, may be incorporated into the recombinant molecule. The recombinant molecule may be introduced into the stem cells or the cells differentiated from the stem cells using in vitro delivery vehicles such as retroviral vectors, adenoviral vectors, DNA virus vectors and liposomes. They may also be introduced into such cells in vivo using physical techniques such as microinjection and electroporation or chemical methods such as incorporation of DNA into liposomes. Such standard methods can be used to either transiently or stably introduce heterologous recombinant molecules into the cells. The genetically altered cells may be encapsulated in microspheres and implanted into or in proximity to the diseased or damaged tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the MSCs are used for the treatment of neurological disease. In another aspect the MSCs of the present invention may also be used as a source of non-neural cells, for example adipocytes, bone, cartilage, and smooth muscle cells. As an example, PCT publication WO99/16863 describes the differentiation of forebrain MSCs into cells of the hematopoietic cell lineage in vivo, The MSCs of the present invention appear to be more plastic and thus are highly likely to also be capable of differentiating into non-neural cell types, such as hematopoietic cells. Accordingly, the invention features methods of treating a patient having any disease or disorder characterized by cell loss by administering MSCs of the present invention (or cells derived from these cells) to that patient and allowing the cells to differentiate to replace the cells lost in the disease or disorder. For example, transplantation of MSCs and their progeny provide an alternative to bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat blood-related disorders. Other uses of the MSCs are described in Ourednik et al. (Clin. Genet. 56:267-278, 1999), hereby incorporated by reference. MSCs and their progeny provide, for example, cultures of adipocytes and smooth muscle cells for study in vitro and for transplantation. Adipocytes secrete a variety of growth factors that may be desirable in treating cachexia, muscle wasting, and eating disorders. Smooth muscle cells may be, for example, incorporated into vascular grafts, intestinal grafts, etc. Cartilage cells have numerous orthopedic applications to treat cartilage injuries (i.e., sports injuries), as well as degenerative diseases and osteoarthritis. The cartilage cells can be used alone, or in combination with matrices well known in the art. Such matrices are used to mold the cartilage cells into requisite shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Transplantation and delivery of MSC&apos;s and their progeny may be at the actual site of cell damage or via the blood stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The following examples describe (i) the derivation of MSCs from postnatal and adult mouse and rat tissue, (ii) the derivation of MSCs from human tissue, (iii) the differentiation of MSCs in vitro to both ectodermal and mesodermal derivatives, (iv) clonal analysis demonstrating that single MSCs are multipotent, (v) the effects of modulating culture conditions on the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of MSCs, (vi) the transformation of MSCs with exogenous DNA, (vii) the in vivo differentiation of MSCs following transplantion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Purification of MSCs from Postnatal Mouse Olfactory Epithelium </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> MSCs from mouse olfactory epithelium were purified as described below. Postnatal mice were stunned with a blow to the head and then decapitated. The heads were sagitally sectioned with a razor blade, and the olfactory epithelia of about six postnatal (P1-P9) mouse pups were stripped from the conchae, nasal septum, and vomeronasal organs using watch-maker forceps. This tissue was placed into 3 mL of medium (DMEM/F-12 3:1) supplemented with 2% B-27 (Gibco, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; Collaborative Research, Bedford, Mass.), 0.1% fungizone, and 0.5 mL/100mL penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Following collection, the epithelia were teased apart with watchmaker forceps, releasing a large number of single cells and small cell clusters. The cell suspension was transferred to a 15 mL tube, and 7 mL of additional medium was added. The clusters were dissociated into single cells by manual titration with a 10 mL plastic pipette and passed through a 60 micron filter (Gibco). Typically, dissociated cells from the olfactory epithelia from six pups were plated into two 50 mL tissue culture flasks and cultured in a 37&deg; C., 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tissue culture incubator. Two days later, most cells in the cultures were dead or dying. A small number (less than 1% of the initial cell number) of large, phase bright cells were present, however, most of which were attached to the flask bottom. Over the next two to six days, these cells divided and produced spherical clusters, which became larger over time. At four to five days in culture, there were approximately 500 clusters of dividing cells per pup used in the original purification. Most of these cell clusters detached from the flask surface over the next few days. These non-adherent cell clusters continued to grow and fused together to become macroscopic, reaching approximately 100 &mgr;m in diameter following 10 DIV. After 12 DIV, the non-adherent cell clusters became macroscopic, reaching approximately 200 &mgr;m or greater in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> If EGF was not added to the medium, small clusters of dividing cells were still seen by 4 DIV, indicating that the cells themselves were producing trophic factors in quantities that, in some cases, was sufficient to maintain their proliferation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Greater than 95% of the cells in the dividing clusters expressed nestin, a marker for stem cells and neural stem cells. These nestin-positive cells could be repeatedly passaged, indicating that the cells were stem cells. Six days after purification, the medium (5 mL) was removed from the flasks. This medium contained many clusters of non-adherent stem cells that had detached from the flask surface. The detached cells clusters were manually triturated with a fire-polished pipette, thereby dissociating many of the cell clusters into single cells. The medium containing the cells was then placed in a second flask with an additional 15 mL of fresh medium (total volume&equals;20 mL). After a further six days, one quarter of the medium was removed and the non-adherent clusters of cells were again triturated and transferred to a new flask with 15 mL fresh medium. These cells have been successfully passaged more than twenty times without losing their multipotency. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Differentiation of Mouse MSCs into Neurons, Astrocytes and Oligodendrocytes </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> After the cellular clusters of Example 1 had been generated, they could be differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Clusters from cultures 7 to 14 days after purification were plated onto polylysine coated 35 mm culture dishes or 4 multiwell culture dishes, in DMEM/F12 media containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) and 2% B-27 (containing no EGF). The medium was changed every three to four days. Over the next six to nineteen days, cells migrated out of the clusters onto the dish surface. Some of these cells had the morphology of neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. We determined the phenotype of these cells using the following antibodies: GFAP for astrocytes; neurofilament 160 (NF-160), MAP-2, &bgr;III tubulin, and NeuN for neurons; and GC for oligodendrocytes. Antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were used to identify dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic neurons. Dopamine-hydroxylase (DBH) was also used for noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes were all found to differentiate from the MSCs of this invention, indicating that the cells were multipotent. We also cultured MSCs from transgenic mice which express &bgr;-galactosidase off of the neuron specific T1 &agr;-tubulin promoter, which allowed us to use staining with the ligand X-gal or antibodies for &bgr;-galactosidase as an additional neuronal marker. We observed &bgr;-galactosidase-positive cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Since the majority of differentiated cells remained in clusters, it was not possible to determine the percentage of cells expressing each marker. The majority of cells that migrated out of the clusters were GFAP positive, while a large number of cells were either NeuN or &bgr;-galactosidase positive. A lower number of cells were GC positive. Therefore the MSCs could differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. TH-positive cells were also identified. These TH-positive cells are most likely dopaminergic neurons and not noradrenergic or adrenergic neurons, since no cells were found to be DBH positive. Significantly, no TH, GFAP or GC positive cells have ever been reported in vivo in the nasal epithelium. Therefore the olfactory epithelium-derived nestin-positive MSCs are capable of differentiating into cell types (e.g., oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, GABAergic neurons, and dopaminergic neurons) never found in the olfactory epithelium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Like the originally-purified olfactory MSCs, MSCs passaged from two to twenty times could also differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. MSCs which had been passaged were plated on polylysine-coated dishes. Cells migrated from the clusters and spread out over the surface of the dish. After 16 DIV, cells that were immunopositive for GC, GFAP, &bgr;III tubulin, NeuN, lacZ, or TH could be identified. Moreover, the proportion of cells positive for the various markers was similar to that seen in the differentiated cultures from the original cultures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Purification of MSCs from Olfactory Epithelial Tissue of Adult Mice and Rats </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Similar to the foregoing results, MSCs were also purified from adult mouse and rat olfactory epithelium and vomeronasal organ using the methods described in Examples 1 and 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Adult mice and rats were anaesthetized with an overdose of somnitol, and then decapitated. The olfactory and vomeronasal organ epithelia were stripped from the conchae and nasal septum and incubated in DMEM/F12 medium for one to two days after their dissection and prior to the rest of the purification procedure. After this incubation, the epithelia were dissociated in an identical manner as the epithelia from juvenile mice. Two days after the isolation, the majority of the cells were dead with the exception of a very few large phase bright cells. These cells divided over the next few days, forming small clusters of dividing cells similar to those described in Example 1. These small clusters grew to give rise to the large clusters that detached from the culture dish surface. After approximately six divisions, cells in some of these clusters began to differentiate and spread out over the flask&apos;s surface, while some other clusters, which had been floating, reattached to the surface and then produced differentiated cells. In some cases, cells multiplied to produce small clusters of cells, but did not grow to form large cell clusters like the postnatal cultures. We have passaged these cells twenty times using the same procedure as that described above with respect to the cells purified from juvenile olfactory epithelium. These proliferating cells from the adult were also nestin-positive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> After the cell clusters derived from adult tissue had been generated, the cells could be differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Seven days after isolation, clusters were plated onto polylysine-coated 35 mm culture dishes or multi-well culture dishes, in medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 2% B-27, but no EGF. Over the next month, cells migrated from the cell clusters and onto the dish surface. We determined the phenotype of these cells using antibodies to astrocytes, neurons, dopaminergic neurons, and oligodendrocytes as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Neurons (including dopaminergic neurons), astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes were found, although the number of these cells was much lower than the number obtained from the juvenile. The cells purified from adult olfactory epithelia are self-renewing and multipotent, and thus are MSCs. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> We derived MSCs from the tongue, another peripheral tissue that contains sensory receptors. The tongue was dissected to remove the epithelial layer that contains the sensory receptors and their underlying basal cells. This layer of tissue was triturated to produce single cells and the single cells were plated in flasks containing DMEM/F12 media supplemented with B-27 and EGF, TGF , and/or bFGF, as described for the olfactory epithelium. After two to three days in a 37&deg; C., <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tissue culture incubator, greater than 99% of the cells in the culture were dead or dying.

The cells in these clusters were nestin-positive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> These nestin-positive MSCs can be passaged using the same techniques as used for the multipotent stem cells derived from the olfactory epithelium.

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Skin from neonatal mice aged 3-15 days was dissociated and cultured in uncoated flasks containing 20 mg/mL EGF and 40 mg/mL bFGF. Over the subsequent one to five days, many (&gt;90%) of the cells die. A small population of cells hypertrophy and proliferate to form small cell clusters growing in suspension. Some of these cells first attach to the tissue cluster plastic, hypertrophy and proliferate, and then detach as the clusters become of sufficient size. Other cells never attach to the tissue culture plastic and instead proliferate in suspension from the beginning. After four to five days, the cell clusters are small but easily distinguishable as clusters of non-adherent, proliferating cells. By seven to ten days, many of the cell clusters reach diameters of as much as 100 &mgr;m, while by two weeks, the cell clusters are macroscopic if left unperturbed. Many cells adhered to the plastic, and many died, but by about three to seven days, suspended, non-adherent clusters of up to about 20 cells formed. These suspended or floating cells were transferred to a new flask seven days after initial culturing; again, many cells adhered, but the cells in the floating clusters proliferated to generate larger clusters of more than about 100 cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, top panel). These larger clusters were then isolated, dissociated and passaged. By this process of selective adhesion, substantially pure populations of floating clusters were obtained after 3 to 4 weeks. Cells that generated these clusters were relatively abundant; 1.5 to 2 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>of abdomen skin was sufficient to generate six 25 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>flasks of floating clusters over this period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> To determine whether clusters contained MSCs, we dissociated the clusters and plated the cells onto poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated dishes or chamber slides without growth factors and, 12 to 24 hours later, immunostained them for the presence of the neural precursor-specific marker nestin. After three passages, the majority of the cells expressed nestin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, top panel), a property they maintained over subsequent passages. They did not, however, express the p75 neurotrophin receptor, a marker for neural crest stem cells, as detected either by immunocytochemistry or western blots. Additionally, they are negative, as detected by immunocytochemistry, for two proteins characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells: vimentin and cytokeratin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> We also determined whether the skin-derived MSCs expressed fibronectin. Four lines of skin-derived MSCs cultured from either adult (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>; left two columns) or neonatal (right two columns) mouse skin, cultured for either long term (first and third columns) or short term (second and fourth columns) were each dissociated, plated for two days in DMEM/F12 (3:1) containing 2% B-27 supplement, and then immunostained for nestin and fibronectin. As is demonstrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the majority of cells expressed both markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> To determine whether clusters of cells could be generated from adults, skin of adult mice was dissociated and cultured as described above. Similar to neonatal mouse skin, most cells adhered to the flask or died when first cultured. After three to seven days, however, clusters of up to approximately 20 cells were observed that subsequently increased in size. When these cells were passaged at least three times (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, bottom panel), and plated onto poly-D-lysine/laminin overnight in the absence of growth factors, they too were immunopositive for nestin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, bottom panel) and fibronectin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The nestin-positive cells from adults and neonates have been passaged in this manner for over 30 passages, during which time the number would have theoretically expanded at least 10<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>-fold (assuming a doubling time of approximately one week). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> To determine whether these nestin-positive, fibronectin-positive cells from skin could generate neural cell types, we analyzed neonatal skin-derived cells after three or more passages and greater by plating them on poly-D-lysine/laminin in the absence of growth factors. Immunostaining (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</cross-reference>) and western blot analysis (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) revealed that the skin-derived cells expressed neuronal markers. At seven days, a subpopulation of morphologically-complex cells coexpressed nestin and neuron-specific &bgr;III-tubulin, a profile typical of newly-born neurons (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>). At later time points of 7-21 days, cells also expressed neurofilament-M (NF-M) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D, 3A</cross-reference>), neuron-specific enolase, and NeuN, three other neuron-specific proteins. Finally, some neurofilament-positive cells expressed GAD (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference>), a marker for GABAergic neurons, which are not found in the PNS. Similar results were obtained for adult skin-derived MSCs, although at early passages some of the &bgr;III-tubulin and neurofilament-positive cells were less typically neuronal in morphology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Immunostaining and western blots revealed that both neonatal and adult MSCs generated cells expressing the glial markers GFAP and CNPase at seven to twenty-one days after plating (FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>D-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>F, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A). Double-labeling for these proteins demonstrated the presence of (i) cells that were GFAP- positive but not CNPase-positive (potentially astrocytes), (ii) cells that expressed CNPase but not GFAP (potentially oligodendrocytes or their precursors), and (iii) a small subpopulation that were bipolar and expressed both CNPase and GFAP (potentially Schwann cells) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</cross-reference>). A subpopulation of GFAP-positive cells also expressed nestin, a finding previously reported for developing CNS astrocytes. Additionally, some cells were positive for A2B5, a marker for oligodendrocyte precursors (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Like GAD-positive neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are normally found only in the CNS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Double-labeling studies supported the following additional conclusions. First, glial versus neuronal markers were expressed in distinct subpopulations of MSCs progeny. Second, after twenty passages, skin-derive MSCs were still able to differentiate into neurons and glial cells. Finally, skin-derived MSCs were able to generate smooth muscle cells (as determined by both expression of smooth muscle actin (SMA) and morphology; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</cross-reference>), adipocytes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>), cartilage, bone, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MSCs Originate from the Dermal Layer of the Skin </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The two major layers of the skin are the epidermis and the dermis. To determine the origin of the skin-derived MSCs, we dissected and cultured P7, P14, and P18 mouse epidermis and dermis. The two layers of the skin were separated by incubating the skin pieces (1&times;2 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) in 0.2% trypsin at 40&deg; C. for about 24-36 hours, or until the dermis could be separated from the epidermis. The cells in each layer were dissociated separately and then cultured in DMEM/F12 (3:1) with B-27 supplement, EGF (20 ng/mL) and FGF (40 ng/mL). Only the cells derived from the dermis generated clusters of cells similar to those derived from whole skin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>). No viable cells were obtained from the epidermis. To characterize the dermis-derived cell clusters, the clusters were cultured for four weeks and then plated onto tissue culture chamber slides coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin. After 24 hours, the cells were then processed for immunocytochemistry. Like MSCs derived from whole mouse skin, the dermis-derived cells coexpressed nestin and fibronectin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> To determine whether skin-derived MSCs are multipotent, we isolated single cells by limiting dilution of cells from clusters that three months prior had been derived from neonatal mice. We cultured the cells for five weeks in medium from the same culture line and containing growth factor, and then differentiated the cells for two weeks in medium lacking growth factor but containing 3% rat serum. The cells were then processed for immunocytochemistry. As is demonstrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, single clones of cells contained NF-M-and CNPase-positive cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>), and GFAP- and CNPase-positive cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Western Blot Analysis of Skin-Derived MSCs </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> For western blot analysis of skin-derived MSCs, four cultures (one adult-derived line and three neonate-derived lines) that had been passaged from seven to 40 times were analyzed either as clusters or following differentiation by plating in medium containing 1% FBS, B-27 supplement, and fungizone for 14 days in 60 mm dishes coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin. Cell lysates were prepared, and equal amounts (50-100 &mgr;g) of protein from each culture were separated on 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to membrane, and then probed with anti-nestin monoclonal antibody (1: 1000; Chemicon), anti NF-M polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Sigma), anti GFAP polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Dako), or anti fibronectin polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Sigma). As positive controls, we used cortical progenitor cells cultured in the presence of CNTF (which results in astrocytic differentiation) or in the absence of CNTF (which results in neuronal differentiation) and adult mouse cortex. As negative controls, we used sympathetic neurons and liver. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, western blotting confirmed the expression of GFAP and NF-M in cultures differentiated from both adult and neonate skin-derived MSCs. Similarly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> illustrates the expression of both nestin and fibronectin in adult and neonate skin-derived MSC clusters. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">MSC Differentiation can be Modulated by Plating Conditions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As is illustrated above, when clusters of skin-derived MSCs are dissociated and plated in medium containing FGF and EGF, most of the nestin-positive cells become neurofilament-positive. We have found that when the cells are plated in medium containing 10% FBS, the cells adopt a morphology similar to that displayed by adipocytes. The adoption of the adipocyte cell fate was confirmed by staining with Oil Red O (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The ability of 10% FBS to induce adipocyte differentiation was true for both adult and neonate skin-derived MSCs (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates both the ability of skin-derived MSCs to differentiate to mesodermal cell types, and the significant effects of plating conditions on the proliferation, differentiation and survival of skin-derived MSCs. In addition to serum concentration, other plating conditions can be altered to influence the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of these cells. Such plating conditions include plating density, the addition of pharmacological agents to the culture media (i.e., pharmacological inhibitors,), the addition of therapeutic protein(s) to the culture media (i.e., growth factors, cytokines, anti-apoptotic proteins), and the addition of small molecules that agonize or antagonize the function of a protein(s) and/or modulate signaling through a signal transduction pathway important in regulating the proliferation, differentiation, or survival of the skin-derived MSCs. These parameters can be altered individually, or in combination to influence the proliferation, differentiation or survival of the skin-derived MSCs. For example, one or more therapeutic proteins can be added to the culture media Furthermore, therapeutic proteins can be added in combination with changes in plating density. Still another embodiment combines the addition of therapeutic protein(s) with the addition of a small molecule. Additional plating conditions include the co-culture of the skin-derived MSCs with other cells or cell types, and the pre-sorting of the skin-derived MSCs prior to plating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Examples of the effects of altering several different plating conditions are presented below. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Pharmacological inhibitors affect survival and proliferation of skin-derived MSCs </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> When skin-derived MSCs are plated for three days in proliferation medium containing FGF, they typically exhibit a spherical morphology characteristic of their proliferative state (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). We tested the ability of pharmacological agents to alter this phenotype. Supplementing the medium with PD098059 (an inhibitor of the ERK MAPK pathway) caused proliferating cells to flatten and differentiate (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), while supplementing with LY294002 (an inhibitor of the PI-3-K pathway), caused the cells to die (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 had no observed effect on the proliferating skin-derived MSCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> These and other pharmacological agents could be added to the culture media to influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Pharmacological agents can be added alone or in combination, and combinations of agents can be co-administered or administered at different times. Additionally, pharmacological agents can be administered in combination with one or more therapeutic proteins or small molecules to influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Such combinations of pharmacological agents and therapeutic proteins can be co-administered or administered at different times to influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Purification of Nestin-Positive Cells from Adult Human Skin </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> We have purified nestin-positive cells from human scalp. To purify MSCs from human skin, we utilized tags of scalp tissue generated by placement of a stereotactic apparatus during neurosurgery. Scalp tags totalling 1 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or less from each of eight individuals were used. The skin included dermal and epidermal tissue. Tissue was cut into smaller pieces that were then transferred into HBSS containing 0.1% trypsin for forty minutes at 37&deg; C. Following trypsinization, tissue samples were washed twice with HBSS and once with DMEM:F12 (3:1) supplemented with 10% rat serum to inactivate the trypsin. Trypsinized tissue was then mechanically dissociated by trituration in a pipette and the resulting dispersed cell suspension was poured through a 40 &mgr;m cell strainer into a 15 mL tube. The tube was then centrifuged for five minutes at 1000 rpm (&tilde;1200&times; g). The cells were resuspended in DMEM:F12 medium containing 40 ng/mL bFGF, 20 ng/mL EGF, 2% B-27 supplement, and antibacterial and antifungal agents, and then cultured in 12 well plastic tissue culture plates. Every seven days, the cell clusters are harvested by centrifugation, triturated with a fire-polished pasteur pipette, and cultured in fresh medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As for the use of rodent skin, most cells (&gt;75%) adhered to the plastic or died, but after seven days, small floating clusters of cells were observed. These clusters were then partially dissociated and transferred to new wells, where they slowly increased in size. After additional passaging, clusters were plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin in 3% FBS with no growth factors, and analyzed for the presence of neural markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Within two weeks, greater than 30% of the cells within the cell clusters were nestinpositive. Immunolabeling of four to six week old cultures also revealed that many of the cells in the clusters were nestin-positive with the percentage varying from less than 50% to greater than 80% two to three days after plating, and that greater than 70% of the cells were fibronectin positive. Double-label immunocytochemistry at the same or longer time-points revealed that, in all cultures, some nestin-positive cells also expressed &bgr;III-tubulin and displayed elongated neurites. Thus, adult human skin is a source for nestin-positive and fibronectin positive MSCs cells that, when differentiated, can express neuron-specific proteins. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Purification and Differentiation of MSCs Derived from other Human Peripheral Tissues Containing Sensory Receptors </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> MSCs can be purified from human olfactory epithelium using the same procedures as described for the purification of stem cells from rodent olfactory epithelium. Source material is acquired by surgical removal of olfactory epithelial tissue from the donor. Because the MSCs are capable of proliferation and self-renewal, little source tissue is required. Preferably, the amount is at least about 1 mm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Conditions for culturing human cells are described in Example 11, above. Other conditions are known to those skilled in the art, and can be optimized for proliferation or differentiation of neural stem cells, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> We can purify MSCs from other peripheral tissues containing sensory receptors, other than the olfactory epithelium, tongue, and skin, using techniques described herein.

Other peripheral tissues containing sensory receptors include, for example, mucosal membranes from the mouth or reproductive system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Transformation of MSCs </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> In therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, it may be desirable to transplant cells that are genetically modified to survive the insults that caused the original neurons to die. In addition, MSCs may be used to deliver therapeutic proteins into the brain of patients with neurodegenerative disorders to prevent death of host cells. Exemplary therapeutic proteins are described herein. In still another example, MSCs can be induced to differentiate into a desired cell type by transfecting the cells with nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins that regulate cell fate decisions (e.g., transcription factors such as Isl-1, en-1, en-2 and nurr-1, implicated in regulating motorneuron and striatal phenotypes). Using such a method, it is possible to induce the differentiation of the specific cell types required for transplant therapy. Therefore, it would be advantageous to transfect MSCs with nucleic acid molecules encoding desired proteins. We have previously used recombinant adenovirus to manipulate both postmitotic sympathetic neurons and cortical progenitor cells, with no cytotoxic effects. We now have established that olfactory epithelial-derived MSCs and skin-derived MSCs can each be successfully transfected with high efficiency and low toxicity. MSCs can be transfected either transiently or stably using not only adenoviral mediated methods, but also using lipofectamine or electroporation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Differentiation of MSCs into the Appropriate Cell Type in vivo Following Transplantion into Adult Rodent Brain </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> One therapeutic use for the MSCs of the present invention is autologous transplantation into the injured or degenerating CNS or PNS to replace lost cell types and/or to express therapeutic molecules. We demonstrate below that the MSCs can differentiate into neurons when transplanted into the adult brain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> If desired, the dopaminergic innervation of the adult striatum can be unilaterally destroyed by a local infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine under conditions in which noradrenergic neurons are spared. Several weeks later, MSCs are transplanted into both the intact and lesioned striatum. Altenatively, the cells can be transplanted into unlesioned animals. The fate of the transplanted MSCs is then determined by immunohistochemistry. Exemplary transplantation studies are described below. These studies demonstrate that transplanted MSCs can differentiate into neurons in vivo, as they can in vitro. In the former case, differentiation and cell fate choice is controlled by the local environment into which each cell is placed. Both in vitro-differentiated and undifferentiated cells are useful therapeutically in the treatment, for example, of neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Parkinson&apos;s disease and multiple sclerosis) or spinal cord injury. For example, dopamingeric neurons differentiated from MSCs, or the MSCs themselves, may be transplanted into the substantia nigra or the striatum of patients having Parkinson&apos;s disease. If desired, the MSCs may also be genetically-modified to express a desired protein. Such genetic modification may help influence the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the MSCs. In one embodiment, the genetic modification protects the transplanted cells from the conditions which caused the degeneration of the endogenous cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In one example, the dopaminergic innervation to adult rat striatum was first unilaterally lesioned with the chemotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, and the efficacy of the lesions was tested two weeks later by amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Two days prior to transplantation, rats were immunosuppressed with cyclosporin. MSCs, produced from olfactory epithelia as described herein, were then stereotactically injected into the caudate-putamen complex on both the lesioned and unlesioned sides. Sixteen days following transplantation, animals were sacrificed, and sections of the striatum were analyzed for nestin-and TH-immunoreactivity. Five of eight animals received successful injections of MSCs in the striatum. Of these, four animals showed evidence of a nestin-positive tract on both the lesioned and unlesioned sides, although tracts on the lesioned side appeared to be more intensely nestin-immunoreactive. On adjacent sections, TH-positive cells were observed confined to an area close to the transplant tract on both the lesioned and unlesioned side. As many as 25-30 TH-positive cells were identified on each section. Cell morphology varied from small, round cells lacking processes to neurons that were morphologically complex with multiple fine processes. In some cases, the processes of these TH-positive neurons extended into the striatum for distances of up to 300 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> To confirm that these TH-positive neurons derived from the MSCs, we performed two sets of experiments in which the transplanted cells were detectably-labeled. In one set of experiments, transplanted MSCs were derived from T 1:nlacZ transgenic mice, in which the neuron-specific T 1 &agr;-tubulin promoter drives expression of a nuclear-localized &bgr;-galactosidase marker gene. Immunohistochemical analysis of animals receiving the transgenic MSCs revealed the presence of &bgr;-galactosidase-positive neurons within the transplant tract, confirming that the transplanted MSCs generated neurons in vivo, as they did in vitro. In a second set of experiments, MSCs were labelled with BrdU for 18 hours, washed to remove the BrdU label, and then transplanted unilaterally into the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned striatum of animals (10 rats, 4 mice) prepared as described herein. Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-BrdU antibody revealed that all animals showed evidence of BrdU-positive transplant tracts. Immunocytochemistry with anti-GFAP revealed that, in both xenografts and allografts, GFAP-positive cells with heterogeneous morphology were concentrated at the transplant site, but were also present in moderate amounts over the entire ipsilateral hemisphere, with additional scattered reactive astrocytes seen in the contralateral hemisphere. GFAP-BrdU double-labelled cells were present mainly within or close to the transplant tract, and varied in morphology from small, round cells with only a few processes, to large polygonal or fusiform cells with multiple processes. Immunohistochemistry with anti-TH revealed that TH-BrdU double-labeled cells were also present, although these were few in number relative to GFAP-BrdU positive cells. BrdU-TH double-labeled cells were mainly small to medium-sized without processes, although some examples of double-labeled cells with processes were found within and adjacent to, the transplant tract. Thus, MSCs generated astrocytes and neurons in vivo, and a subpopulation of the latter were TH-positive. Together, these findings show that peripheral tissue-derived MSCs are capable of generating cell types that are never found within olfactory tissue, including oligodendrocytes and TH-positive neurons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> To determine whether skin-derived MSCs also generate differentiated neural cell types in vivo, we tagged adult mouse skin-derived MSCs with (i) BrdU, and (ii) a recombinant adenovirus expressing GFP, and then transplanted them as cell clusters of about 20 to about 100 cells into the lateral ventricles of P2 rats. Immunostaining fourteen days later revealed that, in all animals analyzed (n&equals;8), transplanted cells had migrated extensively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>). In particular, tagged cells had integrated into the cortex, the hypothalamus and the amygdala in all, and into the hippocampus in two of the transplanted brains (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</cross-reference>). In the cortex, GFP-positive cells were located in patches (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A, 11B</cross-reference>) or occasionally as single cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference>), including some that had integrated into and adopted the morphology of layer V pyramidal neurons (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11B, 11C</cross-reference>). These cells had triangular-shaped soma, and projected a presumptive apical dendrite from layer V towards layer I, in a manner similar to the endogenous layer V neurons. That these cells were neurons was demonstrated by double-labeling for neuron-specific enolase (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>). Immunocytochemical analysis also confirmed that these were transplanted cells, as BrdU-positive cells were present in the same locations as GFP-positive cells in all brains (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In both the amygdala and hippocampus, transplanted cells also displayed neuronal morphology. In the amygdala, GFP and BrdU-positive cells were large, with prominent nuclei, and extensive processes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</cross-reference>). In the hippocampus, transplanted cells had integrated into both the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layers, and their morphology was typical of the endogenous granule and pyramidal cells, respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A, 11E</cross-reference>). GFP-positive staining was also seen within the molecular layer. Finally, GFP- and BrdU-positive cells were observed in other locations, such as the hypothalamus, where the morphology of many cells was not typically neuronal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Skin-derived MSCs tranplanted into adult rats also survive and integrate. We labeled adult mouse skin-derived MSCs that had been passaged more than thirty times with the nuclear dye 33258, washed extensively, and then injected the cells stereotactically into the brains of adult rats that were immunosuppressed with cyclosporin. Four weeks later, we sacrificed the animals by perfusion and processed the brains for histological examination. Hoeschst-labeled cells were present in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and striatum. From these data, we conclude that the transplanted skin-derived MSCs are capable of survival following transplantation. Moreover, cells are capable of migrating from the site of injection to numerous brain regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Skin-derived MSCs are also capable of survival, migration, and integration following transplantation into a hemisected adult mouse spinal cord. In this example, the cells were injected into the injured sides of hemisected spinal cords. Eight days later, the animals were sacrificed and the spinal cords processed for histological analysis. Hoechst-labeled cells were present at the site of the initial injection, and had also migrated extensively into the injured spinal cord. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In addition to being capable of differentiating as neural cells (i.e., neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and Schwann cells), the peripheral tissue-derived MSCs are capable of differentiating as non-neural cells that are normally not found in the tissue from which the cells were derived. For example, we have demonstrated that the skin-derived MSCs can differentiate as smooth muscle cells, cartilage, bone, muscle, and adipocytes. It is likely that the cells described herein have even greater potential. Conditions for the differentiation of the MSCs into smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, cartilage, bone, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle are described herein. Additionally, we show that the skin-derived MSCs can express RNA transcripts consistent with endodermal differentiation. These findings demonstrate that the skin-derived MSCs have potential to differentiate along all three germ layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Signals or conditions sufficient for inducing MSCs to differentiate as other cell types (e.g., lymphocytes, cardiac muscle cells, skeletal muscle cells, melanocytes, and pancreatic cells) are known in the art. For example, unique signals induce neural crest-derived stem cells to become melanocytes, cartilage, smooth muscle cells, or bone (for review, see LaBonne and Bronner-Fraser, J. Neurobiol., 36:175-189, 1998; Sieber-Blum, Intl. Rev. Cytol. 197:1-33, 2000). Conditions for inducing CNS-derived neural stem cells to differentiate as non-neural cells such as smooth muscle cells, skeletal muscle cells, hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells, osteocytes, and chondrocytes have similarly been elucidated (Bjornson et al., Science 283:534-537, 1999; Tsai and McKay, J. Neurosci. 20:3725-3735, 2000; Keirstead et al., J. Neurosci. 19:7529-7536, 1999; Mujtaba et al., Dev. Biol. 200:1-15, 1998; Clark et al., Science 288:1660-1663, 2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Our recent discovery that MSCs maintain the potential to produce both neural and non-neural cell types has been accompanied by the discovery that non-neural stem cells such as bone marrow-derived stem cells (i.e., stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells) also have the potential to produce a wide variety of neural and non-neural stem cells (Ferrari et al., Science 279:1528-1530, 1998; Gussoni et al., Nature 401:390-394, 1999; Peterson et al., Science 284:1168-1170, 1999; Pereira et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:4857-4861, 1995; Prockop, Science 276:71-74, 1997; Kessler and Byme, Annu. Rev. Physiol. 61:219-242, 1999; Pittenger et al., Science 284:143-147). The peripheral tissue-derived MSCs described herein can be induced to differentiate into both neural and non-neural cells that are not normally found in the tissue from which the MSCs were derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> a. MSCs can differentiate to smooth muscle: For induction of differentiation into smooth muscle cells, the cell clusters were centrifuged, the growth factor-containing supernatant removed, and the clusters resuspended in fresh media containing B-27 supplement and either 3% rat serum or 1-3% fetal bovine serum. The clusters were then plated onto dishes coated with poly-D-lysine/laminin, and the medium was changed every 3 to 7 days. Smooth muscle cells were identified by immunocytochemistry with an antibody to smooth muscle actin (SMA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> b. MSCs can differentiate to adipocytes: For induction of differentiation into adipocytes, the cell clusters were centrifuged, the growth factor-containing supernatant removed, and the clusters resuspended in fresh media containing B-27 supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum. The clusters were plated onto dishes coated with D-lysine/laminin. Differentiated adipocytes were identified by OilRed staining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> c. MSCs can differentiate to a skeletogenic fate:: For induction of differentiation along a skeletogenic lineage, the cell clusters were centrifuged, the growth factor containing supernatant removed, and the clusters resuspended in fresh media containing B-27 supplement with 15% fetal bovine serum including skeletogenic supplements. The skeletogenic supplement includes dexamethasone (100 nM), ascorbic acid (50 nM), and b-glycerophosphate (10 mM). After 2 weeks, Alcian Blue staining of the cultures reveals nodules of staining characteristic of chondrocytes. Alcian Blue staining indicates that the chondryocytes produce acidic proteoglycans (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). After 3 weeks, calcium accumulation is observed in the cultures indicative of osteoblast activity. The calcium accumulation is assayed by Alizarin Red S staining (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). Alcian Blue/Alizarin Red co-staining at 3 weeks demonstrates that the calcium accumulation occurs within a layer of chondrocytic proteoglycans (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). Finally, by about 4-5 weeks, optically dense deposits, indicative of bone formation, are observed in the culture (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> d. MSCs can give rise to muscle: To assess the ability of the skin-derived stem cells of the invention to differentiate along a muscle lineage, we co-cultured GFP-labelled skin-derived stem cells with either cardiac myocytes or with C2C12 skeletal myoblasts. After several days of co-culture the skin-derived stem cells were analyzed based on both morphology and on protein expression. Cells co-cultured with cardiac myocytes express fetal cardiac actin, and the fetal cardiac actin expression co-localizes with GFP (indicating that the expressing cells are derived from the skin-derived precursors) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>). Fetal cardiac actin is expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, and the morphology of these cells is consistent with either two cardiac muscle cells or with a single multinucleated skeletal myotube. However these results indicate that skin-derived stem cells can differentiate to a muscle cell type. Cells co-cultured with C2C12 cells give rise to desmin positive cells, and desmin expression co-localizes with GFP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). The morphology and protein expression of the skin-derived stem cells cultured in this manner is consistent with their differentiation to skeletal muscle. These experiments indicate that skin-derived stem cells can differentiate to produce skeletal muscle, and likely can also differentiate to produce cardiac muscle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> e. MSCs can express endodermal markers: We have shown that the skin-derived MSCs of the invention can differentiate to give rise to both neural and non-neural cells. We have presented six examples of mesodermal cell types that arise from differentiation of the MSCs. We now present evidence that the MSCs can also express transcripts consistent with endoderm differentiation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows RT-PCR analysis demonstrating that MSCs express the endodermal marker GATA-4. In a second experiment, skin-derived MSCs were cultured under standard proliferation conditions in the presence or the absence of B-27 supplement. Cells were dissociated and plated in media supplemented with nicotinamide. Differentiated cells were analyzed by RT-PCR for the expression of several endodermal markers including GATA-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, HNF3&agr;, Is11, AFP, HNF3&bgr;, Ngn3, Pdx-1, and Insulin. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> summarizes the results of this experiment which demonstrates that cells differentiated in the presence of nicotinamide express markers of endodennal differentiation. Additionally although endodermal differentiation is observed in cells that were proliferated in either the presence or the absence of B27 supplement, the cells proliferated in the presence of B27 expressed higher levels of endodermal markers than cells proliferated in the absence of B27. This data demonstrates that the skin-derived MSCs of the invention can differentiate to cell types derived from all three germ layers. Additionally, these experiments demonstrate that the modulating of multiple plating conditions (in this case the addition of both B27 supplement and nicotinamide), at different times, can effect the differentiation of the skin-derived MSCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Skin-derived MSCs can differentiate to cell types of both neural and non-neural lineages. We demonstrate that the MSCs can give rise to several different non-neuronal cell types including smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, cartilage, bone, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle. Additionally, we show that the skin-derived MSCs can express transcripts consistent with endoderm differentiation. The tremendous differentiative potential of skin-derived MSCs suggests that in addition to the many cell types shown here, MSCs can also give rise to other mesodermal and endodermal cell types. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that changes in plating conditions (i.e., alterations in serum concentrations, the addition of pharmacological agents and small molecules, and/or co-culturing cells with other cell types) can have dramatic effects on cell proliferation, differentiation and/or survival. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Contacting MSCs with Agents to Influence Differentiation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> As described in detail above, the proliferation, differentiation, or survival of the cells of the invention can be influenced by modulating the culture conditions. For example, we have shown that changes in the plating conditions, or the addition of pharmacological agents to the culture medium influences the proliferation, differentiation and/or survival of MSCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> We show that the proliferation, differentiation or survival of MSCs can also be influenced by contacting the cells with a therapeutic protein including one or more cytokine, growth factor, extracellular protein, etc. One of skill will recognize that the concentration of these agents can be altered to determine the optimal dose. Additionally, the therapeutic proteins may be added alone, or in combination, and combinations of proteins may be administered simultaneously or at varying timepoints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Skin derived MSCs were obtained and cultured as described in detail above. To induce differentiation, cells were plated in the presence of 5% serum supplemented with either retinoic acid or BMP-7. Neuronal differentiation was analyzed using a polyclonal anti-neurofilament antibody. Addition of either retinoic acid or BMP-7 enhances the number and complexity of neurofilament positive cells, in comparison to cells differentiated in the presence of serum alone (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Skin-Derived MSCs are a Distinct Population of Stem Cells </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> We have demonstrated that the skin-derived multipotent stem cells of the invention can differentiate to produce both neural and non-neural cell types. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that these skin-derived stem cells can produce at least six mesodermal cell types (smooth muscle, adipocyte, cartilage, bone, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle). The ability of the stem cells of the invention to differentiate along mesodermal lineages is a characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells previously isolated from sources including bone marrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Although previous experiments using mesenchymal stem cells indicate that such cells are selectively adherent (in contrast to the skin-derived cells of the invention), we performed morphological and immunocytochemical analysis to demonstrate that the skin-derived cells of the invention are distinct from the mesenchymal stem cells previously identified. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from BioWhittaker, and were cultured under the conditions described herein for skin-dervied stem cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> When grown under identical conditions, the two cell populations have significantly different morphology and growth characteristics. The mesenchymal stem cells do not proliferate in suspension when cultured under conditions which allow the skin-derived stem cells to grow as non-adherent clusters as described in detail herein. The cells were dissociated and plated overnight under the conditions described for the skin-derived cells. The two cell types are morphologically distinct: the skin-derived cells are considerably smaller while the mesenchymal stem cells have a more flattened appearance. Additionally although mesenchymal stem cells rapidly proliferate in standard mesenchymal cell medium, they survive but do not readily proliferate under the conditions used here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Immunocytochemical analysis further illustrates the differences between these two cell types. Cells were dissociated, plated overnight, and analyzed immunocytochemically for the expression of vimentin, cytokeratin, nestin, and fibronectin. Both mesenchymal stem cells and the skin-derived multipotent stem cells of the invention express fibronectin. However, the two cell types differed in the expression of the other three markers analyzed. Skin-derived stem cells express nestin (mesenchymal stem cells do not). Mesenchymal stem cells express vimentin, and a sub-set of the mesenchymal stem cells in culture express cytokeratin (skinderived stem cells express neither vimentin nor cytokeratin) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Despite the ability of skin-derived stem cells to differentiate along several mesodermal lineages, the stem cells of the invention are distinct from previously identified mesenchymal stem cells. These differences are demonstrated by the differential morphology and protein expression observed when mesenchymal stem cells are cultured under the conditions described herein for the proliferation and differentiation of skin-derived stem cells. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Isolation of Skin-Derived Multipotent Stem Cells from Human Foreskin </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> We have previously demonstrated that the multipotent stem cells of the invention can be isolated from both rodent and human skin. Exemplary samples have been obtained from the scalp, back, and abdomen of donors. One of the unique advantages of the present invention is that skin represents a plentiful and easily accessible source of autologous or heterologous stem cells for transplantation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> However, in addition to autologous or heterologous skin samples taken specifically to generate stem cells for transplantation, skin samples are routinely harvested from healthy donors in the course of many medical procedures. Such samples represent a plentiful source of tissue for the generation of skin-derived stem cells. Such stem cells, or the differentiated progeny thereof, could be used for research purposes, as well as for autologous or heterologous transplantation. Exemplary procedures which generate excess skin include circumcision and cosmetic surgery (e.g., face lifts, liposuction, and &ldquo;tummy tucks&rdquo;). Typically, the excess tissue generated following these procedures is removed and discarded from otherwise healthy patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, stem cells can be isolated and cultured from said excess tissue. Such stem cells, or the differentiated progeny thereof, can be used immediately for transplantation or research purposes. Alternatively, the stem cells, or the differentiated progeny thereof, can be banked for later use by the donor (autologous transplantation), or for the treatment of a related or unrelated recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, stem cells are harvested from the foreskin of a male patient. The stem cells, or the differentiated progeny thereof, can be stored for later use by either the same male patient or his blood relatives. Alternatively, the stem cells, or the differentiated progeny thereof, can be used for the treatment of an unrelated recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Foreskin samples from human patients were obtained from surgeons performing circumcisions. The samples were taken from males ranging in age from newborns to adolescents. We note that we have generated proliferating cultures of non-adherent skin-derived stem cells from 21 samples, and have not observed any significant differences in the survival, proliferation, or differentiation characteristics among the cultures based on the age of the donor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The quantity of tissue obtained following circumcision is relatively small. Accordingly, we reasoned that the number of stem cells in said tissue may be relatively low, and that the survival of cultures derived from these samples may improve if the stem cells could be enriched in relation to non-stem cells in the sample. Previous studies demonstrated that skin-derived stem cells reside in the dermal layer of the skin. Thus, we employed a novel method for isolating and culturing stem cells from limiting quantities of tissue. Briefly, foreskin samples were first cut into pieces and then enzymatically digested to separate the dermal and epidermal layers. Specifically, we digested the tissue for 24-48 hours at 4&deg; C. in an enzyme blend containing collagenase and either Dispase or thermolysin. However, one of skill in the art can readily select from among commercially available proteases to choose one or more enzymes which would achieve a similar effect. Following separation of the dermal and epidennal layer, the dermal layer was dissociated by further digestion in the enzyme blend for 30 minutes at 37&deg; C. followed by trituration to release single cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> We cultured the cell suspension, as previously described, in non-adherent vessels in the presence of EGF and FGF2. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> demonstrates that skin-derived stem cells harvested from human foreskin proliferate as non-adherent clusters. The clusters are morphologically indistinguishable from skin-derived stem cells derived from rodent tissue. Skin-derived clusters are loosely compacted, and the cells can be readily dissociated manually without the use of proteases. Such characteristics appear to distinguish skin-derived clusters from CNS-derived neurospheres. Note that we have cultured these proliferating skin-derived stem cells in the presence and absence of LIF, and have observed no significant differences in their proliferation, differentiation or survival characteristics. Furthermore, we have currently passaged and maintained foreskin derived stem cells as proliferating cultures for greater than three months. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> One of the characteristics of skin-derived stem cells isolated from rodents or other human tissue is the differentiation capacity of these cells. We have previously demonstrated that skin-derived stem cells can differentiate along a range of neuronal and non-neuronal fates. Similarly, foreskin-derived stem cells can differentiate along a wide range of neuronal and non-neuronal fates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The expression of various neural and non-neural markers was assayed following differentiation of foreskin-derived stem cells. Briefly, proliferating, non-adherent clusters were dissociated and plated on an adherent substratum in the presence of proliferation medium. After several days, the medium was changed to differentiation medium (5% fetal bovine serum/no mitogens), and marker expression was analyzed during this differentiation phase. Our results indicate that foreskin derived stem cells can differentiate along a wide range of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. These results are consistent with our finding for the differentiation potential of skin-derived stem cells obtained from rodents and other human tissue samples. For example, under differentiation conditions, foreskin derived stem cells can express nestin, fibronectin, bIII-tubulin, neurofilament-M, GFAP, CNP, S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, peripherin, and smooth muscle actin (FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). The expression of bill-tubulin and neurofilament-M, in combination with the morphology of these cells, is indicative of the formation of highly complex neurons (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>). The expression of GFAP and CNP demonstrate the ability to give rise to glial cell types (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>). The expression of S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and peripherin indicates that foreskin-derived stem cells can generate additional neuronal cell types including bipolar cells (S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) and peripheral neurons (peripherin) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>). Finally, the expression of the normeural marker smooth muscle actin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>) indicates that, as has been observed for other skin-derived stem cells, foreskin-derived stem cells have extensive differentiation capacity and can give rise to both neural and non-neural cell types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> The foregoing experiments were performed using the following methods, except where otherwise noted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> Skin-Derived MSC Culture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> For neonatal (three to 14 days) and adult (two months to one year) mice, skin from abdomen and back was carefully dissected free of other tissue, cut into 2-3 mm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>pieces, washed three times in HBSS, and then digested with 0.1% trypsin for 40 minutes at 37 C, followed by 0.1% DNAase for one minute at room temperature. Tissue pieces were then washed twice with HBSS, once with media (DMEM-F12, 3:1, 1 g/ml fungizone, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) containing 10% rat serum (Harlan Bioproducts), and twice with serum-free media. Skin pieces were then mechanically dissociated in media, and the suspension poured through a 40 M cell strainer (Falcon). Dissociated cells were centrifuged, and resuspended in 10 ml media containing B-27 supplement, 20 ng/ml EGF and 40 ng/ml bFGF (both Collaborative Research). Cells were cultured in 25 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>tissue culture flasks (Coming) in a 37 C, 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tissue culture incubator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> To culture human skin-derived MSCs, two to three pieces of scalp tissue ranging between 4-9 mm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>(generated by placement of the stereotaxic apparatus for neurosurgery) were washed with HBSS, any subcutaneous tissue was removed, and the skin was cut into small pieces 1-2 mm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>in size. Tissue pieces were transferred to 15 mL Falcon tubes, washed three times with HBSS, and enzymatically digested in 0.1% trypsin for 40 minutes at 37 C, and then washed as for mouse tissue. Dissociated cells were suspended in 5 mL of the same media used for mouse cultures, with the addition of 20 ng/ml LIF (R&amp;D Systems Inc.). The cell suspension was placed in Falcon 6-well tissue culture plates and maintained in a 37 C, 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tissue culture incubator. Cells were subcultured by partial dissociation of the clusters that formed every 7 to 10 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> To passage floating clusters of cells, the medium containing the cell clusters was centrifuged, the cell pellet mechanically dissociated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, and the cells reseeded in fresh media containing B-27 supplement and growth factors as above. Cells were passaged every 6 to 7 days. For induction of differentiation into smooth muscle cells, the cell clusters were centrifuged, the growth factor-containing supernatant removed, and the clusters resuspended in fresh media containing B-27 supplement and either 3% rat serum or 1-3% fetal bovine serum. The clusters were then plated onto 4-well Nunclon culture dishes coated with poly-D-lysine/laminin, and the medium was changed every 3 to 7 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Transplantation of Olfactory Epithelium-Derived MSCs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Olfactory epithelium-derived MSCs were purified and cultured as described herein. Female Sprague-Dawley rats or CD1 albino mice (Charles River, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) weighing 180-200 g or 25-30 g, respectively, were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) (intraperitoneal) prior to stereotactic injections of 24 &mgr;g of 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (dissolved in 5 &mgr;L of 0.9% saline containing 0.2 mg/ml ascorbate) into the right medial forebrain bundle (Tooth bar:-2.4 mm; A:-4.4 mm; L: 1.0 mm; V:7.5 mm). Two weeks after the lesion, animals were tested for rotational behavior. Animals were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) once a day until the day of sacrifice. For MSC transplantation, anaesthetized animals were mounted in a Kopf stereotactic apparatus, and 2&times;2.5 &mgr;L aliquots of MSCs were injected unilaterally into the lesioned caudate putamen or bilaterally in some animals. The injections were made using a 5 &mgr;L Hamilton syringe at the following coordinates: Tooth bar, &minus;2.4 mm; A: 0.2; L: 3.0; V: 5.5-6.0. Injections were performed over a period of three minutes, a further five minutes was allowed for diffusion, and the needle was then retracted. These 5 &mgr;L injections contained MSCs derived from one neonatal pup cultured for 7 to 14 days. For the BrdU experiments, BrdU (10 &mgr;M) was added to culture media for 18 hours, after which the MSCs were washed three times with fresh media to remove the BrdU, and then transplanted one day later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> Transplantation of Skin-Derived MSCs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Labeling of skin-derived MSCs was performed as follows. Three days prior to transplantation, free-floating cell clusters were partially dissociated by gentle trituration, and then exposed to 50 MOI of a recombinant adenovirus expressing GFP, using standard techniques. Twenty-four hours later, the MSCs were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium containing 2 &mgr;M BrdU for an additional two days. Prior to transplantation, MSCs were rinsed five times with fresh medium and resuspended to a concentration of 50,000 cells/&mgr;l. At the time of transplantation, approximately 75% of the MSCs expressed GFP, while 95% were BrdU positive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> MSCs labeled with BrdU and GFP were stereotaxically injected into the right lateral ventricle of cryoanaesthetized two day old rat pups (co-ordinates from Bregma: lateral 1.5 mm, ventral 3.3 mm). Approximately 50,000 cells were injected over a three minute period in a volume of 1 &mgr;L. Fourteen days following transplantation, mice were perfused with 50 mL 4% formaldehyde buffered with PBS. Fifty micron coronal sections through the forebrain were cut using a freezing microtome and analyzed immunocytochemically. All eight animals receiving cell transplants showed extensive labeling for tagged cells. No evidence of tumor formation was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Immunostaining </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Immunostaining of olfactory epithelium-derived MSCs was performed as follows. With the exception of GC immunocytochemistry, culture dishes were washed twice with Trisbuffered saline (TBS; 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8), then fixed with 4% formaldehyde, washed three times with TBS, blocked with TBS plus 2% goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Mississuagua, Ontario, Canada), and 0.1% Triton-X (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis Mo.) for 30 minutes, then incubated with primary antibody in TBS plus 2% goat serum. Following primary antibody incubation, the dishes were washed three times with TBS, incubated in secondary antibody in TBS plus 2% goat serum, washed three times, and then viewed with a fluorescence inverted microscope. The antibodies to GFAP (Boehringer Mannheim,Laval, Quebec, Canada), &bgr;III tubulin (Sigma), NeuN (Dr. R. Mullen), MAP-2 (clone AP-20; Sigma), and NF-160 (American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas Va.) were monoclonal antibodies used at concentrations of 1:200; 1:25; 1:10, and 1:1 respectively. Antibodies to nestin (a gift from Dr. Ron MacKay (National Institutes of Health), TH (Eugenetech Eugene, Oreg.), and DBH (Eugenetech) were rabbit polyclonal antibodies used at concentrations of 1:1000, 1:200, and 1:200 respectively. Secondary antibodies Cy3 conjugated goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Cy3 conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and were used at 1:1500. For double-labelling experiments, we used FITC goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> For GC immunocytochemistry, living cultures were incubated in DMEM containing HEPES, 5% heat inactivated horse serum (HS), and 1:10 GC antibody for 30 min at 37 C, washed three times with the medium/HEPES/HS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes, rinsed three times in TBS, incubated in Cy3 conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1500) for two hours, and finally washed three times in TBS.
