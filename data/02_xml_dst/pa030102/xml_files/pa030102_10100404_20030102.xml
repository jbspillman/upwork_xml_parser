<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A method for printing an image from an external memory such as smart media brought to a photography studio, or the like by a user, and a method for utilizing a communication circuit to make an order for a print output have been proposed as a digital photo service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The following system is disclosed, for example, in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-4311. In the system, a transfer request means of a server computer periodically accesses each image handling apparatus, or transmits a request to the apparatus, and a transfer means of each image handling apparatus transfers a digital image in response to each access or request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Moreover, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-15737 discloses the following system. That is, in the system, for at least one of data recording regions of a recording medium, an access right is set such that the user cannot write data. The access right of at least one another data recording region is set such that the user can write the data. Thereby, a digital input image transferred to a laboratory by the user can be recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-88577 discloses a photograph processing system in which data from various media can be input, various output forms can be handled, and a client&apos;s demand can efficiently be satisfied. </paragraph>

The image memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is attached to the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the memory is not detachable. Moreover, after the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> photographs an image, the camera is incorporated into an image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> described below. Here, the digital camera incorporated in the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is handled as a photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is an apparatus for printing out image data from the photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a camera insertion port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through which the photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is to be inserted into the apparatus. The image data from the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is supplied to a CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via a connector (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> controls the whole image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to an image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, user instruction section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, charging box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The data incorporated in the image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is output to a monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and displayed as a corresponding thumbnail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the user instruction section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is a user interface for a user to designate a print size, the number of prints, a frame to be printed for partial print, and the like. The charging box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> charges a fee in accordance with the printer size, the number of prints, and the like, and has an amount display portion and a payment port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> prints out the image stored in the image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes an image processing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Moreover, the image processing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the printer performs JPEG extension, Y conversion suitable for the printer, printer control, and the like. An output image <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> printed out under control of the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the user instruction section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is realized by input means such as a keyboard, button, and lever. Moreover, the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be for a general purpose, and a printer of an ink jet type, heat transfer type, or the like is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> An operation of the digital camera system according to the first embodiment will next be described with reference to a flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is now assumed that the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> photographs the image, and the photographed image is stored in the image memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is first judged in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> whether or not the photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has been inserted into the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through the camera insertion port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Here, when the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is inserted, the flow shifts to step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>inserted through the camera insertion port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is brought to a set state in which the camera is connected to a connector (not shown). Moreover, the CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> downloads data such as image data and photography date into the image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the image memory <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> attached to the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the image data incorporated in the image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is displayed as the corresponding thumbnail in the monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Here, the user instruction section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> judges in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> whether or not there is an input indicating various requests from the user. The user designates, for example, the print size, the number of prints, and the like. When there is no request input, the flow shifts to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the set digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is removed from the image hand Thereafter, the flow shifts step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when there is the user request input in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an amount charged in accordance with designated input information is displayed in the display portion of the charging box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, it is judged in step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> whether or not the user has paid the displayed amount into the box. Here, when the designated amount is not paid, in step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> the set digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is removed from the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the flow shifts to step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When the designated amount is paid via the charging box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the charging is settled in step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, when the settlement is confirmed, in the following step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> starts printing the image in accordance with the designated information. Thereafter, in step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the printed-out output image <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is discharged from the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When the photographed digital camera is inserted into the image handling apparatus in this manner, the output image corresponding to the image data is printed out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the digital camera is inserted into the image handling apparatus. For example, an interface such as RS232C may be used to connect the apparatus to the digital camera via a cable, or the data may be downloaded from the digital camera via infrared communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the present invention will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing a constitution of a main part of a recycle system of a camera using the digital camera according to the second embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Additionally, in the second embodiment described below, the same constituting elements as those of the first embodiment are denoted with the same reference numerals, and description thereof is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> An image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has the camera insertion port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through which the photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be inserted, CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, user instruction section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, charging box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and further includes a communication apparatus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a containing section <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The communication apparatus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> informs the outside of information such as the number of recovered digital cameras. Moreover, the containing section <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a section in which the recovered digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is temporarily contained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the constitution, the photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is inserted into the camera insertion port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Then, the CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> downloads the data such as image data and photography date of the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The image downloaded in the image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is displayed as a thumbnail in the monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Then, the user refers to the image displayed on the monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and operates the user instruction section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, so that the user can designate the information such as the print size and the number of prints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> When the information is designated, the corresponding charged amount is accordingly displayed in the display portion of the charging box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Here, when the user pays the displayed amount into the box, the image processing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>processes the image, and the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> prints the output image <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>subjected to the print-out is recovered in the containing section <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> without being returned to the user. The data in the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be deleted upon or after recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, a recovered digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>recovered in the containing section <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is periodically recovered by a recoverer. Alternatively, data of the recovered digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is one-dimensionally managed, and the digital camera may be recovered by the recoverer as occasion demands using a communication function of the communication apparatus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> After the image data in the digital camera is printed out in this manner, the digital camera is recovered, and memory deletion, battery replacement, cleaning, and the like are performed. Therefore, recycling is performed. A serviceman may periodically collect the recovered digital cameras, or may collect the cameras as the occasion demands. In the latter case, the number of digital cameras recovered by each digital camera system is checked through a communication circuit. Since a recyclable component is used in this manner, the cost of the digital camera is advantageously lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the following examples of a charging system are considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In one example, a first camera is sold at a price from which a profit can be obtained, and an amount obtained by subtracting a rental fee from the price is returned at a time of recovery. In this case, payment may be performed by cash, or a credit card, debit card, prepaid card, and the like may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In another example, the first digital camera is sold at the price from which the profit can be obtained, and a second new digital camera is sold only at the rental fee at the time of recovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of the present invention will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the constitution of the main part of the digital camera system according to the third embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In the third embodiment, an image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has the camera insertion port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through which the photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be inserted, CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, user instruction section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, charging box <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and further includes an external memory <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as an external storage medium. </paragraph>

Subsequently, when the thumbnail is displayed in the monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the user can designate the information such as the print size and the number of sheets through the user instruction section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When the information is designated, the corresponding charged amount including the print fee and the fee of the external memory <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is displayed in the display portion of the charging box <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Here, when the user pays the displayed amount into the box, the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> prints the output image <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In this case, depending upon selection of the user, when the amount including the fee of the external memory <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is paid into the charging box <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the image data to be printed out is stored in the external memory <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and outputted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the third embodiment, after the image data in the digital camera is transferred to the user via the external memory, the digital camera is recovered, the memory deletion, battery replacement, cleaning, and the like are performed, and the recycling is thus achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the user instruction section <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is operated in order to select a compression ratio of the image data stored in the external memory <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the image data to be stored, so that the user can select a small-capacity storage medium. Therefore, a unit price of the external memory can be saved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>subjected to the print-out may be recovered without being returned to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A fourth embodiment of the present invention will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the constitution of the main part of the digital camera system according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the fourth embodiment, an image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has the camera insertion port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through which the photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is to be inserted, CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, external memory <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, user instruction section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, charging box <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and communication apparatus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The user instruction section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes a keyboard and monitor. The user instruction section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can input the information on the print-out, such as the print size and the number of prints, information on the external memory <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and an address for transferring the image data to a user&apos;s personal computer (PC) <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The personal computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is owned by the user, and has a communication function. A user&apos;s printer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is operated via the personal computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the charging box <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, in addition to the print fee, a communication fee is charged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the containing section for the recovered digital camera may be disposed similarly as the constitution of the recycle system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the constitution, the photographed digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is inserted into the camera insertion port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Then, the CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> downloads the data such as the image data and photography date of the digital camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into the image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the apparatus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, when the thumbnail is displayed in the monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the user can designate the information such as the print size and the number of prints through the user instruction section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In this case, depending upon the user&apos;s selection, the image data can be transferred and stored onto storage mediums such as a hard disk drive (HDD) of the user&apos;s personal computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (or a designated personal computer) via electronic mail. That is, the user&apos;s (or designated) address is input via the user instruction section <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and communication is performed via the communication apparatus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, so that the image data is transferred to the user&apos;s personal computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (or the designated personal computer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> When the image data is transferred in this manner, the charged amount including the fee determined in accordance with the print size and the number of prints and the communication fee for transferring the data to the personal computer is displayed in the display portion of the charging box <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Here, when the user pays the displayed amount into the box, the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> prints the output image <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the image data is transferred to the personal computer via the communication apparatus <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the user may only transfer the image Adata to the user&apos;s personal computer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> without obtaining the output image from the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In this case, the user can obtain the output image from the image data using the user&apos;s printer <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Additionally, in this case, only the communication fee is charged in the charging box <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> According to the fourth embodiment, an output means for printing out the photographed image data is given a function of transferring the data via the communication circuit. When the user designates a user&apos;s mail address in the output means, the photographed data desired by the user can be transferred. Thereby, the user can take the data into the memory of the user&apos;s personal computer without purchasing any external memory, and the cost is advantageously lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing one example of the constitution of the main part of a general digital camera which is applied to the digital camera system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> digital camera <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes: a lens <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>; an image sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> such as an imager; an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for converting analog data from the image sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> into digital data; an image processor <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> for processing each digital image; an image memory <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>; a JPEG processor <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> for compressing/extending the image; a liquid crystal monitor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> for checking the image to be photographed or the photographed image; an external memory <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> as an attachable/detachable external storage medium; a CPU <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for performing various controls of the digital camera; a timing generator (TG) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for controlling the image sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>; and a group of switches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> including various switches such as a power switch and shutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the digital camera <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a subject image taken via the lens <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is controlled by the CPU <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and timing generator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and photoelectrically converted by the image sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the image data converted into an electric signal is taken into the image memory <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> via the analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and image processor <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The image taken into the image memory <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is displayed in the liquid crystal monitor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Additionally, after the JPEG processor <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> compresses/extends the image, the image is stored in the external memory <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Since the image sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is constituted of a CMOS sensor in this manner, a low cost and low power consumption can be realized. The power consumption of the CMOS image sensor is generally {fraction (1/10)} of the consumption of the conventional sensor, and it is therefore possible to miniaturize a battery and the camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the image processing circuit such as a driving circuit and image compression circuit or the image memory is disposed in a chip of the CMOS image sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, further lower cost and lower power consumption can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In the digital camera system, even when the image memory <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is defined, for example, for 24 or 36 frames of image, there is no problem. Therefore, a constitution of one chip is realized. Furthermore, in the present digital camera system, when a storage capacity is set, for example, for about 24 frames (similarly as the current disposable camera), the power for use can be saved more than expected. Therefore, the battery can have minimum necessary cost or size, and the camera cost can be saved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing one example of the constitution of the main part of a digital camera exclusive for the recording which is applied to the digital camera system of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> digital camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes the lens <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, image sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, image processor <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, JPEG processor <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, image memory <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, CPU <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, timing generator (TG) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and group of switches <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and further includes an interface connector <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The interface connector <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is a connector required for outputting the image data taken into the image memory <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to the outside of the digital camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, because the digital camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> does not have any external memory. Therefore, in order to constitute the camera which is exclusive for the recovery, the special interface connector <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is used. On the other hand, when a general-purpose interface connector is used, a special image format is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> For the digital camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, to constitute the digital camera exclusive for the recording, the liquid crystal monitor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and external memory <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are omitted from the digital camera <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. That is, the digital camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has substantially the same capability as that of the current 35 mm film camera, so that the cost is reduced. Since the digital camera is recycled, the camera can inexpensively be set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the CMOS sensor as the image sensor. When an artificial retina LSI is used in the image sensor, a peripheral function can be integrated, and a low voltage and low power consumption can be achieved. For example, in M64270P (trade name) manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corp., in addition to the image sensor, image processing functions such as color correction, &ggr; conversion, black level correction, and noise reduction, an eight-bit analog-to-digital converter, and a control circuit are built in one chip. Therefore, the digital camera can be realized by a microcomputer and memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is also possible to use a monochromatic image sensor in the image sensor. In the monochromatic image sensor, with the same pixel number, a resolution is tripled at maximum as compared with a color image sensor. Moreover, with the same resolution as that of the color image sensor, the pixel number can be reduced, and the cost can be lowered. The image processing is also simplified as compared with a color image processing, and a circuit cost can therefore be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> According to the digital camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the camera function is limited to a recording function. Concretely, the liquid crystal monitor for preview or reproduction display, external memory terminal, and the like are omitted. This can produce an effect that the camera is recycled and the digital camera is inexpensively manufactured. Moreover, a connection terminal may be disposed so that an external monitor of a cellular phone, PDA, or the like can be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> A fifth embodiment of the present invention will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the constitution of the main part of the digital camera system according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an attachable/detachable external storage medium <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> such as smart media is attached to a digital camera <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It is recorded in the external storage medium <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that the camera has been purchased via an image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is an apparatus for printing out the output image corresponding to the image data from the external storage medium <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> detached from the digital camera <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a memory insertion port <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> through which the photographed external storage medium <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is to be inserted into the apparatus. The image data from the external storage medium <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> inserted through the memory insertion port <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is supplied to the CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> via the connector (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> controls the whole image handling apparatus <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The CPU <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to the image memory <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for downloading and storing the photographed data recorded in the external storage medium <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, monitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, user instruction section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, charging box <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The image processing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> performs JPEG extension, &ggr; conversion suitable for the printer, printer control, and the like. Under the control of the image processing circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the printed-out output image <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is obtained from the printer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
