<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an emission cleaning installation for cleaning and eliminating emissions, and to an emission cleaning method which uses this emission cleaning installation, and more particular to an emission cleaning installation which can be fitted into existing large-scale incineration furnaces and is able to oxidatively break down environmental pollutants which are contained in the emissions expelled from an incineration furnace and of which dioxins, dibenzofurans, coplanar PCBs, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the like are representative examples, by the photocatalytic action of a photocatalyst, without control of the emission temperature, and still more particular to an emission cleaning method which uses this emission cleaning installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, emission cleaning installations which involve cleaning the emissions expelled from incineration furnaces have been proposed as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. A Cleaning installation whereby the emission supply duct is provided with electrostatic separators or bag filters or cyclones and the like, in order to physically eliminate dioxins from the emissions; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. A Cleaning installation which is filled with an adsorption agent comprising activated carbons, activated charcoals and the like, in order to eliminate by adsorption environmental pollutants of which the dioxins contained in the emissions are representative; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 3. A Device which mixes photocatalysts for breaking down environmental pollutants in the emissions by oxidation, by means of the photocatalytic effect of the photocatalyst with the emissions, and introduces them into an emission decomposition tower, and which recovers the photocatalyst by means of dust separators downstream of the emission decomposition tower after the photocatalyst has been photoexcited by means of ultraviolet light emitted from a low-pressure mercury lamp, thus revealing its photocatalytic effect (patent application JP-H05-285342). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, the emission cleaning installation which is described in patent application JP-H05-285342 is an installation which mixes the photocatalyst into the emissions, and if a large amount of photocatalysts is mixed into the emissions, the transmission through the emissions deteriorates (because the light is reflected, and consequently the light transmission deteriorates). Although it is possible for exciting light which is radiated from the light source to be radiated to a sufficient extent with respect to the photocatalyst situated relatively close to the light source, and therefore the photocatalyst can be photoexcited, thus revealing the photocatalytic action (&equals;photocatalytic function), the exciting light (which is emitted from the light source) cannot be radiated to a sufficient extent with respect to the photocatalyst situated at a distance from the light source. Therefore, because the photocatalyst cannot be sufficiently photoexcited, the photocatalytic function of these photocatalysts cannot be sufficiently displayed and, overall, it is known that there are problems with the efficiency of the emission cleaning method brought about by the photocatalytic action (&equals;photocatalytic function) of the photocatalyst being reduced considerably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There were also further problems relating to the cleaning installation overall becoming complicated and therefore more expensive, since the photocatalyst had to be separated back out of the decomposition gas after treatment, for example by means of separators and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, there are elimination problems with devices provided with electrostatic separators or bag filters or cyclones and the like and there are also problems with eliminating and recovering dioxins and the like in the emissions using such devices. Specifically, of the dioxins contained in the emissions, although it is possible to eliminate the dioxins contained in fly ash, together with dust materials, the dioxins adhering to very fine fly ash low-boiling, gaseous dioxins and the like cannot be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, since the emissions expelled from incineration furnaces are generally at elevated temperatures, a control unit is required if such environmental pollutants are eliminated and recovered, for example by means of separators, in order to provide rapid, considerable cooling of hot emissions by means of cooling devices and the like before they are fed to the separator. This led to problems in terms of the emission cleaning installation overall becoming complicated and more expensive. Moreover, similar problems are encountered with emission cleaning installations which use bag filters or cyclones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, it has been proposed to initiate decomposition processes by oxidation using a metallic catalyst made from titanium, vanadium, platinum and the like as an additional agent. However, since in this decomposition process by oxidation carried out by the metallic catalyst, the effective temperature of the atmosphere is in the region of 230&deg; C. and also the temperature range which will be effective is narrow, it is necessary for the emissions to be quickly and considerably cooled by means of a cooling device or the like before they are fed to the separator or bag filter or the cyclone, yet at the same time it is necessary for the cooled emissions to be heated and for their temperature to rise again; this makes temperature control of the emissions very troublesome and laborious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, in elimination methods carried out by absorption agents comprising the abovementioned activated carbons or activated charcoals, although in theory it is possible for the low-boiling, gaseous dioxins to be eliminated, it is also necessary for the used waste adsorption agent which has absorbed dioxins to be fed for secondary treatment. Additionally, because the emission temperature is in the region of greater than 150&deg; C., dioxins which have been absorbed with great difficulty become separated from the adsorption agent and are then deposited, or because the adsorption capacity of activated carbons falls, and then the desired elimination by adsorption can no longer be achieved, or because the emission temperature generally fluctuates readily and constantly, various problems are always encountered, involving the dioxins which have been adsorbed at high temperature becoming separated and then dispersed in the emissions once again, etc. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the photocatalyst pellets are coated onto the surface of the porous support, or onto the surface of woven fabric which comprises heat-resistant fibres, or onto the surface of nonwoven, knitted fabrics, or onto the surface of any other type of fibrous structures with a titanium oxide coating in the anatase form as the crystalline form, or are attached to fine titanium oxide particles in the anatase form as the crystalline form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Porous supports which may be mentioned include porous metals, of which nickel-cadmium, stainless steel, permalloy, aluminium alloys, copper and the like are representative examples, and porous ceramics, of which activated carbon, activated alumina, silica gel, porous glass materials and the like are representative examples. Moreover, it is also possible for the surface of the titanium oxide coating in turn to be coated with a metal coating of platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, palladium, iron, silver, copper, zinc and the like, and in addition it is also possible to use woven fabric, which comprises heat-resistant fibres mixed with photocatalyst, nonwoven, knitted fabric or any other type of fibrous structure. With a view to achieving a larger surface area and with regard to cost, it is advantageous to use porous ceramics made from activated carbons, activated aluminas, silica gel and the like as the support, and they may be in the shape of grains, platelets, cylinders, prisms, cones, spheres, rugby balls and the like, and may be in any form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Within the context of the present description, the term &ldquo;titanium oxide&rdquo; may be replaced by a mixture or more than two mixtures selected from groups consisting of titanium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, vanadium oxide, dibismuth trioxide, tungsten trioxide, ferric oxide, strontium titanate and cadmium sulphide, and can be understood as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If the photocatalyst is titanium oxide, photocatalyst pellets can be produced by coating, for example, either titania sol which can be obtained by suspending fine titanium oxide particles in water or titania sol which can be obtained by hydrolysis of organic titanate onto the surface of the abovementioned porous support by means of dip-coating processes, dropping processes, spraying processes and the like and then firing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is possible to coat the surface of the titanium oxide coating, thereby covering the surface of the porous support with an additional metal coating of platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, palladium, iron, silver, copper, zinc and the like by means of a photo-electrodeposition process or CVD process and PVD processes of cathode sputtering or vacuum deposition and the like, thus facilitating the breakdown of the electric charge of electrons and holes and thereby accelerating the oxidative breakdown by the photocatalytic action. The oxidative breakdown or reduction decomposition can be introduced by using the abovementioned metal catalyst as an additional agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The heat-resistant fibres described above may be organic or inorganic if they are able to withstand temperatures of over 400&deg; C., preferably of approximately 800&deg; C. With a view to achieving excellent heat resistance it is preferably possible to use the inorganic fibres of which glass fibres, alumina fibres, aluminosilicate fibres and silicon carbide fibres are representative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the term &ldquo;photocatalyst&rdquo; is understood as meaning a substance which is produced in such a way that electron excitation during irradiation with light (exciting light) of relatively high energy (i.e. short wave) creates an energy gap between the conduction band and valence band of a crystal in valence bands (photoexcitation) and as a result electrons and holes are formed: examples which may be mentioned include titanium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, vanadium oxide, dibismuth trioxide, tungsten trioxide, ferric oxide, strontium titanate, cadmium sulphide, of which it is possible to use one type or more than two types. The use of titanium oxide is preferable since its photocatalytic action is better than that of the others. In addition, crystalline titanium oxides are to be found in anatase form, rutile form and brookite form. Although any of these forms can be used, the anatase form is preferred, since its photocatalytic action is better than that of the others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the photocatalyst is photoexcited by the ultraviolet light, an electron/hole pair is formed on the surface of the photocatalyst. Of this pair, the electron allows superoxide anions (O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) to form on the surface by reduction of oxygen, and the hole allows hydroxyl radicals (.OH) to form on the surface by oxidation of hydroxyl. These highly reactive, actively oxidizing substances (i.e. superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals) allow the environmental pollutants in the emissions to be broken down by oxidation and then reliably rendered harmless. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Moreover, fine photocatalyst pellets can be coated or attached to the surface of heat-resistant woven fabric, nonwovens, knitted fabrics or any other type of fibrous structure using the same production process as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> If the light source is to be specified in more concrete terms, it is possible, for example, to mention sunlight, a disinfecting lamp, a black light lamp, a fluorescent lamp, an incandescent lamp, a mercury lamp, a UV lamp, a xenon lamp, a halogen lamp, a metal halogen lamp and the like. Moreover, if a combination of a disinfecting lamp, which radiates ultraviolet light with its maximum wavelength in the vicinity of 254 nm, and a black light lamp, which radiates ultraviolet light with a maximum wavelength in the vicinity of 380 nm, is used, it is possible to excite the surface of the photocatalyst pellets by allowing the ultraviolet light radiated from the disinfecting lamp and the ultraviolet light radiated from the black light lamp, to pass into the interior by passing through the photocatalyst pellets. This means that the exciting light is able to sufficiently irradiate all the photocatalyst pellets with which the photocatalyst container is filled and thus sufficiently excite the photocatalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Although it is possible for cylinder bodies, which accommodate the light source to be designed in such a way, that only one end thereof is open to the outside, if both ends thereof are open to the outside, the light source can be air-cooled. It is particularly preferable for a blower which supplies wind for air cooling (ventilation means) from one end to the other, to be arranged on the outside of the cylinder body, since the light source can be air-cooled more efficiently and thus its service life can be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the emission cleaning installation are explained in more detail below with reference to the exemplary embodiments which are specifically illustrated in the drawing. These embodiments are only representative and are therefore not intended to restrict the invention in any way to the exemplary embodiments described below, provided that the present invention does not go beyond their basic core. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the first exemplary embodiment, emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be designed in such a way that a plurality of these emission cleaning installations adjoin one another in series as a group and then continuously adjoin the emission outlet duct, or that a plurality of these emission cleaning installations continuously adjoin the emission outlet duct in parallel, as a group, in a plurality of rows, or that a plurality of groups of emission cleaning installations adjoining one another in series are provided and these in turn continuously adjoin the emission outlet duct in parallel, as a group, in a plurality of rows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from the first exemplary embodiment is aimed at any arrangement continuously adjoining the emission outlet duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the incineration furnace <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>; specifically, it is intended to include both types of emission cleaning installations namely those which are fitted as an indispensable structural unit when the furnace is designed and those which are connected downstream of the emission outlet duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the existing incineration furnace. They may be fitted in a freely removable manner with respect to the emission outlet duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and may be secured unreleasably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the following text, to facilitate matters the emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is explained by way of example on the basis of being used on its own. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed in such a way that it is provided with a ultraviolet light permeable cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, through which the incineration emissions expelled from the incineration furnace <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> pass, with photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which are accommodated in the interior of the corresponding cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and come into contact with the incineration emissions, and with a light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which is arranged on the outer side of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and radiates the exciting light <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which is to excite the photocatalyst <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, and the entire unit is fitted in the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> so that it adjoins the incineration emission outlet duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the incineration furnace <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Looking at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises an outer cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> made from quartz glass and an inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> made from quartz glass and is therefore of dual design, and six reinforcing panes <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> of quartz glass are arranged between the outer cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and both chambers, namely chamber <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and chamber section <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> between the outer cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, are filled with photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the transparent silica gel surface of which is coated with photocatalyst (titanium oxide coating). The outer cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and the reinforcing pane <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are each subjected to an embossing treatment and are designed in such a way that the exciting light radiated from the light source is reflected irregularly and that they, including the photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> situated in the central section of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, can be photoexcited homogeneously. Moreover, the abovementioned cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (outer cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>) and the reinforcing pane <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are designed in such a way as to be transparent and to allow ultraviolet light to pass through, and consist of heat-resistant materials, and in addition to quartz glass, they may also, for example, consist of fused quartz glass, vitreous silica, light-transmitting alumina. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, they may be designed in such a way that the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, which is provided with the reinforcing pane <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the outer side, is accommodated in the interior of the outer cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, or in such a way that the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>&prime;, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, is accommodated in the interior of the outer cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>&prime; which is provided on the inside surface with the reinforcing pane <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, at the end section of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> there is to be found cover component A<highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, which has an insertion hole <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, covering in an airtight manner in each case via a heat-resistant endless ring <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and emission guiding component <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the tip section <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of which is fitted into the insertion hole <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and there is also emission expulsion component <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, the tip section of which is fitted in the insertion hole <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, communicating with one another in an airtight manner in such a way that the emissions do not leak out. Moreover, each other end section of the emission guiding component <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the emission expulsion component <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> communicate in each case with the emission outlet duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in series and in an airtight manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Moreover, twelve tubes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> for supplying air, which communicate from the outside of the abovementioned emission guiding component <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to the inside, are arranged in helical form on the emission guiding component <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and sufficient amounts of oxygen can be fed towards the central section of the inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has inner surrounding wall <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> made from quartz glass and outer surrounding wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> made from stainless steel, and on the inside surface of the outer surrounding wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> there are six disinfecting lamps <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, which are at even distances apart, and in each case two black light lamps <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> at regular intervals between the disinfecting lamps <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, making a total of twelve black light lamps (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is accommodated in the interior <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which is surrounded by the inner surrounding wall <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The tip of the emission guiding side of the inner surrounding wall <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is covered by a covering component, which has a round groove <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the fact that the tip section of the inner surrounding wall <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is pushed into this round groove <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and therefore sealed, means that they communicate in an airtight manner such that the emissions do not leak outwards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, the covering component A<highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, which is provided with the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the covering component, which is provided with the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, are sealed in an airtight manner such that the emissions cannot escape outwards, with a heat-resistant O-ring <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> between them, and in this way the emissions which are introduced from the emission guiding element <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are passed via the interior of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the emission expulsion component <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Moreover, at the tip of the emission guiding side of the outer surrounding wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> there is a covering component A<highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is pushed into the central section of the emission guiding component <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, lying in between, and the circumference of which is fitted in a sealed state, and the tip of the emission expulsion side is also provided with the covering component B<highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which is pushed into the central section of the emission expulsion component <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, lying in between, and the circumference of which is fitted in the sealed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if a cooling-water circulation path for cooling the light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is provided on the outside of the outer surrounding wall <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (not shown), this is a preferred arrangement, since it is possible to aim at extending the service life of the light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Moreover, it is preferable for the entire cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to be designed as a Liebig condenser (not shown) and for the photocatalyst body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be cleaned with water approximately once every month, by way of example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, according to emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the first exemplary embodiment, which is fitted in the manner described above, it is possible for emissions which are introduced from the emission outlet duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> expelled from the incineration furnace <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be fed via the emission guiding component <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> into the interior of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and to be expelled to atmosphere via the emission expulsion component <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Incineration emissions, which are introduced into the interior of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, come into contact with the titanium oxide coating on the surface of the photocatalyst body <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with which the interior of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is filled. Since the photocatalyst (titanium oxide) <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> in the titanium oxide coating is irradiated by the radiation of ultraviolet (exciting light) radiated from the light source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> onto the outer side of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the radiation of ultraviolet (exciting light) which is unevenly reflected and received by the embossed inner cylinder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the outer cylinder <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and by the reinforcing pane <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, and since a sufficient quantity of air (in particular oxygen) can be mixed with the emissions via tube <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> for supplying air, and since the exciting action involves the thermal excitation of the titanium oxide, and these effects act synergistically, the result, as described above, is the formation of highly reactive, actively oxidizing substances, and these highly reactive, actively oxidizing substances result in an advantageous effect which is such that environmental pollutants in the emissions are broken down by oxidation extremely efficiently and rapidly, and can therefore be rendered harmless. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> If, as diagrammatically indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an embodiment is then used in which two emission cleaning installations <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are fitted practically in parallel with respect to the incineration emission outlet duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and furthermore a forced blower <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is fitted in the vicinity of the outlet opening <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of each emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, it is possible for the emissions to be circulated through these two emission cleaning installations <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. It is also possible, by way of example, to fit a damping component (not shown) for preventing gases from flowing back in the vicinity of the connection between the emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and the emission outlet duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the second exemplary embodiment may also be designed in a similar way to the emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from the first exemplary embodiment, in that a plurality of these installations adjoin one another in series as a group and adjoin the incineration emission outlet duct, or a plurality of emission cleaning installations adjoin one another in parallel, as a group, in a plurality of rows and these adjoin the incineration emission outlet duct, or it is possible to provide a plurality of emission cleaning installations which adjoin one another in series and a plurality of these groups adjoin one another in parallel, as a group, in a plurality of rows and these adjoin the incineration emission outlet duct. Moreover, it is also possible to include both types of emission cleaning installations, be it the emission cleaning installation which is fitted as an indispensable structural unit during construction of the incineration furnace, an installation which is subsequently connected downstream of the emission outlet duct of the existing incineration furnace, an installation fitted in a freely removable manner with respect to the emission outlet duct, or an installation which is secured unreleasably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the following text, the emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the second exemplary embodiment is also explained, for the sake of simplicity, on the basis only of the example of an application using the emission cleaning installation in question on its own. </paragraph>

Moreover, in this emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> it is advantageous, since it is thus possible to prevent deterioration of the catalytic function of the photocatalyst <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, if the photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are cleaned with water once or twice a month, by way of example, and also because this makes it possible to reduce the laborious operation of changing photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Housing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> consists of stainless steel, and the first connecting section <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, which feeds the emissions towards the housing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and the second connecting section <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>, which expels the emissions, are arranged opposite one another, and with respect to the emission outlet duct the two connecting sections <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> communicate with one another in series and in an airtight manner. The interior of each space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is filled with the photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in which the surface of the transparent silica gel is coated with the photocatalyst (titanium oxide coating) <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Moreover, all possible sizes and shapes of the first connecting section <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and the second connecting section <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> are possible, with the exception of hollow cylinders; by way of example, they may, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, be of frustoconical design, and this shape and size can be designed in each case as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Although the shape and size of the housing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be designed as desired according to the amount of emissions being treated, the flow velocity thereof and the like, if it is rectangular in cross section, the emissions fed into the housing can initially be brought together at the inner wall surface of the first space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and then they can be helically agitated at this point. Moreover, the emissions which are moving upwards in the space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> can also be brought together against the inside of the top cover <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and can also be agitated helically at this point. The same effect occurs in each space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the opportunity of contact between the photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the environmental pollutants in the emissions can be increased considerably, and therefore the extent to which the environmental pollutants are broken down can also be improved. Moreover, if the inner wall surface of the space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is alternately provided with a baffle plate (not shown), it is possible to further increase considerably the opportunity of bringing the photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the environmental pollutants into contact with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if the cross-sectional area of the housing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>&prime;, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, is of elliptical or circular design and the space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>&prime; is therefore of right-angled design, as indicated by a line which crosses the first connecting section <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and the second connecting section <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>&prime;, it is easier to produce the housing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and, even if the amount of raw materials is limited, it is still possible to ensure the maximum possible volume and, since the same effect as that described above can be obtained, this is an advantageous configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if at the first connecting section <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>pipe <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for supplying air, which provides communication from the outside inwards, is provided, for example, in the form of a spiral (an example of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), the outside air can be fed into the emissions and the two components can be mixed, having the advantage that sufficient oxygen can be supplied for the photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Moreover, it is possible, by way of example, for guide plate, baffle plate <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and the like, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, to be arranged on the inner wall of the first connecting section <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>&prime;) and/or on the inner wall of the second connecting section <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>&prime;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it is also advantageous if the inner surface of each space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is polished to a mirror finish, since the exciting light can be reflected and because the photocatalyst situated on the opposite side of the light source <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> can be effectively excited, and also because the photocatalyst function can be utilized more efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The cylinder body <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> consists of quartz glass and is arranged at almost identical intervals in each space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> in which the light source <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is fitted in a freely removable manner. The cylinder body <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be of any desired design, if it is transparent and passes through ultraviolet light and consists of heat-resistant materials, and may also, in addition to quartz glass, consist, for example, of fused quartz glass, vitreous silica, light-transmitting alumina and the like. Moreover, although it can be designed in such a way that only one end of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is opened to the outside (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>), it is advantageous if both ends of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> together are opened to the outside (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), since the light source <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> can be effectively air-cooled and in this way it is possible to extend the service life of the light source <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The number, arrangement and the like of cylinder bodies <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to be arranged in each space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> can be designed as desired according to the shape and size of the space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, the amount of emissions to be treated, the flow velocity and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In the emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> designed as described above, it is possible for emissions which are expelled from the incineration furnace and are passed to the emission outlet duct to be introduced into the space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> via the first connecting section <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, so that they can pass through a plurality of spaces <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and can be expelled to atmosphere from the second connecting section <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The emissions which are introduced into each space <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> come into contact with the titanium oxide coating which is applied to the surface of the photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with which its interior is filled. In the process the photocatalyst (titanium oxide) in the titanium oxide coating is excited by irradiation with ultraviolet light (exciting light) which is radiated out of the light source <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> provided in the cylinder body <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and is also excited by radiation of the ultraviolet light (exciting light) which is reflected from the inner wall surface, which has been polished to a mirror finish, of the cylinder body <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and in addition the exciting effect caused by thermal excitation of the titanium oxide also participates, so that they act synergistically. Therefore, the highly reactive, actively oxidizing substances, as described above, can be formed on the surface of the photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and these highly reactive, actively oxidizing substances are able to effectively and rapidly break down the environmental pollutants in the incineration emissions by oxidation, thus rendering them harmless. Moreover, if, as described above, the design is such that a sufficient amount of air (in particular oxygen) can be mixed into the incineration emissions via the tube for supplying air, it is possible for the environmental pollutants in the incineration emissions to be broken down by oxidation even more effectively and rapidly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an emission cleaning single body is designed in the shape of a box; the width is 45 cm, the depth is 40 cm and the height is 50 cm, while its interior is divided into six spaces which alternately communicate on the upper cover side and the baseplate side, and three cylinder bodies made from quartz glass are provided at regular intervals in each space, and two emission cleaning installation single bodies, which are filled with 60 liters of photocatalyst pellets with the photocatalyst (titanium oxide coating) applied to the surface of transparent silica gel, adjoin one another in tandem and continuously adjoin the stack of the incineration furnace provided in industrial waste disposal plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the emissions were in each case extracted from the emission inlet opening and from the outlet opening of the emission cleaning installation, and the concentration of dioxins in the abovementioned emissions was measured. The concentration of dioxins was measured according to the guidelines laid down by the Ministry of Health and Welfare &ldquo;Manual for the Standard Measurement of Dioxins during Waste Disposal&rdquo; (February 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The measurement results are given in Table 1:

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In Tests 1 and 4, although the concentration of dioxins in the emissions expelled from the incineration furnace of the plant under examination lies in the range from 41 ng TEQ/m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>N-85 ng TEQ/m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>N, if they are treated using the emission cleaning installation according to the invention, it has been found that the concentration is reduced considerably to a range of from 0.53 ng TEQ/m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>N-3.2 ng TEQ/m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>N, and the level of dioxins eliminated lies in the range from 92.6%-99.4%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the total quantity of dioxins contained in the extracts taken from the recovered photocatalysts&mdash;although not representing an actual value or the like&mdash;based on the total quantity of dioxins in the treated incineration emissions is at most approximately 1-3%. This demonstrated that the dioxins eliminated in each test did not adhere to the photocatalyst bodies, but rather they were, as it were, broken down by oxidation by the photocatalytic action of the photocatalyst pellets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Moreover, it was found that it is possible to use photocatalyst pellets which were previously excited by ultraviolet radiation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> This emission cleaning installation <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> applies to both forms, on the one it is fitted as an indispensable structural unit during construction of the incineration furnace, and secondly that in which it is retrofitted in the flue duct of the existing incineration furnace, and it may also be secured irremovably with respect to the flue duct, but it is preferable for the installation to be fitted in such a manner that it can be removed freely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, this cleaning installation <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> continuously adjoins the emission supply duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, with the connecting component <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in between, and is provided with a filtration container <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, the interior of which is filled with filtration materials <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, with a photocatalyst container <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, which continuously adjoins the corresponding filtration container in a freely removable and airtight manner, via or without a heat-resistant component <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, and the interior of which is filled with the photocatalyst pellets (not shown), and with a component <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> for expelling emissions, which continuously adjoins the corresponding photocatalyst container <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> in an airtight manner via or without a heat-resistant sealing material <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, and covers the photocatalyst container single body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> in three layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Connecting component <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> consists of stainless steel and is provided with an air intake opening <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, which is of the same shape and size as the cross section of the emission supply duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and with a lower opening (not shown), which is designed in the same shape and size as the cross section of the filter container <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and the heat-resistant sealing material <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is provided between the emission supply duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the filter container <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The filter container <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> consists of heat-resistant stainless steel, and its outer form is in the shape of a box, and has integral shelf materials <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> filled with filtration materials <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of mesh-like design. The filtration materials <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> are either ceramic balls or silica gel balls with alkali-treated diameters of 5-25 mm; if appropriate, the photocatalyst pellets may be admixed. Moreover, the alkali-treated filtration materials <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> have the effect of neutralizing hydrogen chloride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the photocatalyst container <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> also consists of the heat-resistant stainless steel, and its shape and size comprise dimensions of 1500&times;1500&times;500 mm, while its interior is filled with 1100 liters of photocatalyst pellets <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> with the photocatalyst (titanium oxide coating) applied to the surface of the transparent silica gel. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a photocatalyst removal hole <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> for removing the photocatalyst when changing photocatalyst pellets is formed between the base surface and side wall, in the vicinity of the connecting section. The base surface <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is designed in the form of a gable or hipped roof, in such a way that it is inclined from the central section, and adjoins the side wall above the photocatalyst removal hole <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight>. Moreover, a plurality of housings <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> are provided almost at regular intervals, in such a way that they pass through its interior, and from both sides disinfecting lamp <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>&prime; and black light lamp <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>&Prime; are arranged in the longitudinal direction and in the transverse direction in an alternating positional relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> consists, in the form of a hollow cylinder, of quartz glass, but may also be of any desired design, provided that it is transparent and is permeable to ultraviolet light and is formed using heat-resistant materials; therefore apart from quartz glass, it may also consist, for example, of fused quartz glass, vitreous silica, light-transmitting alumina and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Since the base surface <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is designed in the form in which it is inclined from the central section, the photocatalyst pellets (not shown) can easily be recovered via the photocatalyst removal hole <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> and reprocessed when the photocatalyst removal hole <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> is open. The photocatalyst container <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is separated from the filter container <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and the reprocessed photocatalyst pellets are added, then the two are assembled. By repeating the above steps, it is possible for the laborious operation of changing the photocatalyst pellets to be carried out more easily and therefore the photocatalyst pellets can be reprocessed and recovered a large number of times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Referring back to FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> the component <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> for expelling emissions is a component which continuously adjoins the lower end of the photocatalyst container <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which is furthest away from the emission supply duct <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in an airtight manner via or without a heat-resistant sealing material <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, and its entire shape is practically identical to the abovementioned connecting component <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, except that it has an outlet opening <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> for the emissions to be treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The cleaning installation <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is continuously adjoined, in an airtight manner, by three containers of the photocatalyst container single body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> in series via the heat-resistant seal <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, but the number of connections, the cross-sectional shape of the photocatalyst container <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the overall shape and size and the like can be designed as desired on the basis of the treatment capacity and the like of each incineration furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the cleaning installation <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, which has a photocatalyst container connecting three of the abovementioned photocatalyst container single bodies, adjoins the stack of the incineration furnace which is fitted in an industrial waste disposal plant, and the concentration of dioxins in emissions taken in each case from the emission supply duct (inlet) and outlet opening (outlet), and also the concentration of coplanar PCBs, which was once again determined under a &ldquo;Special Regulation&rdquo; as the subject of the regulation, were measured every fourteen days for a period of one month. The measurement of the concentration of dioxins was carried out on the basis of the Ministry for Health and Welfare &ldquo;Manual for the Standard Measurement of Dioxins in Waste Disposal&rdquo; (February 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the photocatalyst container single body <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, as described above, is designed in the shape and size comprising dimensions of 1500&times;1500&times;500 mm, and its interior is filled with 1100 liters of photocatalyst particles with the photocatalyst pellets (titanium oxide coating) applied to the surface of the transparent silica gel.

From this, it was possible to deduce and was found that the dioxins or coplanar PCBs eliminated in each test have not adhered to the photocatalyst pellets, but rather were, as it were, broken down by oxidation by the catalytic action of the photocatalyst pellets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> From the above results, it was established that the considerable elimination capacity can be achieved even in the region of the emission temperature of 300&deg; C., at which the formation of dioxins was previously considered to be at its maximum, and that even coplanar PCBs, which were previously difficult to eliminate using oxidative photocatalysts, can be effectively reduced in the same way as polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs). </paragraph>
